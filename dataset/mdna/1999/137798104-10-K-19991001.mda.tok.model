results of operations 
the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
fiscal net sales cost of sales gross profit expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense other income total other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income comparison of fiscal  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal  from million in and million in the increase in net sales over these periods is primarily due to sales growth in the european bicycle market as the awareness of the cannondale brand has strengthened there 
the company s rate of sales growth during the past three years has decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in inventory by many of the company s domestic dealers and the cessation of growth in the bicycle market 
during fiscal  the reduction of inventory also became prevalent among many of the company s international dealers 
in addition  during fiscal the company s sales of high end  higher margin bicycles were negatively impacted by its suppliers ability to provide sufficient quantities of certain components in the second quarter 
furthermore  sales volume was adversely affected by equipment problems at the company s bicycle manufacturing facility related to the introduction of year products  which hindered cannondale s ability to produce sufficient quantities to fill orders in the fourth quarter 
the company has made an effort to partner itself with specialty bicycle retailers capable of achieving growth objectives consistent with those of the company 
as a result  over the last three years  the number of specialty retailer locations serviced directly by the company has remained relatively constant  increasing to approximately  at the end of fiscal from approximately  at the end of net sales reported by cannondale us were million in fiscal  million in and million in net sales reported by cannondale europe increased to million in fiscal  from million in and million in net sales of cannondale japan decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which had increased slightly from million in fiscal the company believes the decrease in sales by cannondale japan during fiscal is primarily attributable to the slumping japanese economy 
net sales of cannondale australia increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal based on the company s relative market share within the domestic and international markets  management anticipates that international sales will continue to increase as a percentage of total sales in the future 
gross profits 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  from in and in the decrease in the gross profit rate in fiscal and compared to fiscal primarily reflects price pressure on the company and other bicycle suppliers in conjunction with the maturation of the bicycle market and cessation of its growth 
in addition  the stronger us dollar during fiscal and adversely affected the gross profit rate of the company s foreign subsidiaries as the cost of materials purchased from the us increased compared to fiscal in addition  during fiscal  the company s ability to ship high end  higher margin bicycles during its second fiscal quarter was limited by its suppliers ability to provide sufficient quantities of certain components 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in and million in increased selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects higher warranty costs principally associated with increased sales in europe and the impact of higher depreciation expense associated with the million and million of capital expenditures in fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal compared to  increased selling  general and administrative expenses are directly associated with additional personnel  primarily associated with the company s sales force  and advertising and marketing costs required to support the planned growth 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increased selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal and reflects the company s continued investment to support planned growth 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in and million in  reflecting the company s commitment to improve its current products and processes  and to generate new and innovative products 
the increase in spending during fiscal was primarily attributable to the development of the mx motorcycle and the manufacturing process associated with it 
the company invested approximately million in research and development for its motorcycle during fiscal compared to million during fiscal in addition  the company continued to invest in the improvement and expansion of its existing bicycle and coda product lines 
the company s integration of its sponsored race teams  in particular the volvo cannondale mountain bike racing team and the saeco cannondale road racing team  into its research and development efforts  continued to be a significant aspect of its investment during fiscal the company uses its race teams for regular testing of both prototype and finished production models 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in and million in increases in interest expense are primarily attributable to debt incurred associated with the company s repurchase of million and million of its common stock during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  its investment of million and million in capital expenditures during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and the increase in working capital requirements associated with seasonality of the business 
interest expense incurred by the company in fiscal as a result of the million loan to joseph montgomery is offset by interest charged to him and is recorded in other income expense 
other income expense 
other income primarily consists of finance charges relating to accounts receivable  which totaled   and  for fiscal  and  respectively and foreign currency gains losses of   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  for fiscal other income includes interest income of  related to the loan to mr 
montgomery 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense

selected quarterly financial data  seasonality 
the following table presents selected unaudited quarterly data for the two most recent fiscal years 
this information has been prepared by the company on a basis consistent with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such quarters 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
for the quarter ended july  march  december  september  june  march  december  september  unaudited in thousands  except per share data net sales         cost of sales         gross profit         expenses selling  general and administrative         research and development         total operating expenses         operating income         other expense  income before income taxes         income tax expense   net income      basic income per share 







diluted income per share 







selling  general and administrative expenses have been restated  and as a result the earnings per share amounts for the first three fiscal quarters of have been restated pursuant to the company s adoption of statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use during the fourth fiscal quarter of for further discussion of the impact of the adoption of sop  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results fluctuate from quarter to quarter principally as a result of a number of factors  including product mix  the timing and number of new retailer openings  the timing of shipments and new product introductions and the effect of adverse weather conditions on consumer purchases 
in addition  the company s business is seasonal due to consumer spending patterns  which in turn affect dealer delivery preferences  and historically has resulted in more shipments and significantly stronger results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters january through june 
through its arp program  the company attempts to reduce the seasonality of its shipments and to smooth the production process by providing incentives for retailers to take delivery of a higher percentage of their annual bicycle order in the first and second fiscal quarters 
during fiscal  a trend that began in fiscal  inventory reductions by domestic dealers  occurred among the company s international dealers 
for fiscal  the inventory reduction by the company s dealers was a significant cause of the variation in the historical pattern of stronger sales in the company s third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the third and fourth fiscal quarters together accounted for and of the company s total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the change in dealer delivery preferences  the company expanded its arp at the end of fiscal under the expanded arp  the cannondale sales force formulates a delivery plan with its retailers  typically based upon historical delivery information  that conforms with the retailers growth objectives and their inventory needs 
this program incorporates freight and pricing discounts as incentives for the retailers to achieve their growth objectives formulated together by the retailers and the company s sales force 
the company believes that the expanded arp allows cannondale to maximize the competitive advantage of its flexible domestic manufacturing capabilities which provides the company with the ability to meet changes in market trends and demand rapidly 
the company s gross margins fluctuate primarily according to product mix  the cost of materials  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the timing of product price adjustments and markdowns 
although some operating expenses are variable with sales  most expenses are incurred evenly throughout the year 
the third and fourth fiscal quarters accounted for and of the operating income for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition to lower net sales attributable to the inventory reduction by the company s bicycle dealers  operating income during the fourth quarter of fiscal was adversely affected by equipment problems at the company s bicycle manufacturing facility related to the introduction of year products that hindered its ability to produce sufficient quantities to fill orders and by the increased investment in research and development primarily related to the development of its motorcycle 
it is unlikely that the seasonal nature of the business will change significantly in the future 
while the company was successful in reducing the impact of the seasonality during fiscal and  and in achieving profitable performances each quarter  the company in the past has incurred  and may in the future incur  operating losses in a fiscal quarter  as the business remains highly seasonal 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company s primary sources of working capital used over the past three years have been borrowings under its credit facilities 
on january   the company entered into an million amended and restated multicurrency credit facility the facility secured by all of the company s tangible and intangible domestic assets 
the facility  as amended may   extends through january it allows for cannondale us  cannondale europe and cannondale japan to borrow up to million under a multicurrency revolving line of credit and provides for a million term loan that amortizes by million months from the inception date of the facility 
the facility includes a provision that permits the company to borrow up to million of the million revolving line of credit on a short term basis less than days 
under the revolving line of credit  the company has the option to borrow at the following rates a variable rate that is defined as the higher of the bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points  a short term market rate that is an offered rate per annum quoted by the bank or the libor london interbank offered rate applicable to the currency borrowed plus an interest rate margin libor margin 
the libor margin ranging from to basis points is determined quarterly based upon predetermined performance criteria 
the company is obligated to pay a facility fee ranging from to basis points on the balance of the facility based on the same performance criteria as the libor margin 
the interest rate on the term loan is the libor plus a margin that was basis points at july   and increases to basis points january   basis points april  and basis points july  the facility contains restrictive and financial covenants relating to  among other things  the payment of dividends  the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock and the maintenance of minimum levels of cash flow  capitalization  interest coverage and tangible net worth 
the company is currently in compliance with all restrictive and financial covenants 
at july   the borrowings outstanding under the facility were million 
cannondale europe and cannondale japan each maintain a separate credit facility for short term borrowings 
in february  cannondale europe entered into a multicurrency credit arrangement  which allows cannondale europe to borrow up to  dutch guilders approximately million at july  on a short term basis 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is a market rate  applicable to the currencies borrowed  plus with a minimum rate of 
cannondale japan has an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to  japanese yen approximately million at july  
approximately  and  of principal amount was outstanding under the dutch and japanese facilities  respectively  at july  the credit arrangements contain no specific expiration date  and may be terminated by either cannondale europe  cannondale japan or the lenders  at any time 
the dutch and japanese facilities are guaranteed by cannondale us net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the principal uses of cash in operating activities over the three year period were primarily to support the increased investment in accounts receivable and inventories associated with the company s growth in sales and market conditions 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction of inventory compared to the end of fiscal which reflects the effort by the company to maintain inventory levels consistent with its sales levels 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the company s continued profitability and its management of receivable growth  offset by an increase in raw material inventory levels caused by the lower sales growth levels in the last two quarters of the fiscal year 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  a significant portion of the expenditures related to the construction of the motorcycle manufacturing facility and equipment to develop and manufacture the motorcycle million 
in fiscal  the majority of the expenditures related to the completion of the corporate headquarters and research and development facility in bethel  connecticut and the expansion of the company s bicycle production facility in bedford  pennsylvania million  and the commitment entered into by the company to purchase a cessna citation jet million 
for both fiscal and  the balance of capital expenditures principally represents investments in computer equipment and manufacturing equipment to support increases in production volume to support the company s planned growth 
in fiscal  the majority of the capital expenditures million related to the construction of the headquarters and research and development facility in bethel  connecticut and the expansion of the company s bicycle production facility in bedford  pennsylvania 
the cost of the corporate headquarters and research and development facility was partially funded with the proceeds from the sale of the company s previous headquarters facility million in fiscal  and from the cda financing of million which was funded in fiscal the company also received funding in fiscal  from the department of economic and community development for research and development equipment acquired in conjunction with the new facilities 
the company obtained million of financing from pida to fund approximately of the cost for the expansion of the company s bicycle production facility in bedford  pennsylvania  of which million was received during fiscal  and the balance was received during the first quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of its philipsburg facility to the moshannon valley development authority for approximately million  an amount which approximated the net book value of the facility 
the operations from the philipsburg facility were moved to the bedford facility in june during the third quarter of fiscal  the company entered into a million sale leaseback transaction for its cessna citation jet aircraft 
the sale resulted in a  gain for the company which was deferred and is being amortized over the five year term of the lease 
the lease provides the company with the option to terminate the lease before the end of the lease term for predetermined amounts without penalty 
at the end of the lease term  the company can purchase the equipment for of its original cost  renew the lease for the then fair market value rental or sell the aircraft to a third party 
if the proceeds from the sale of the aircraft are less than of the purchase price  the company shall make a final payment in the amount of the deficiency not to exceed of the original cost 
the related lease is being accounted for as an operating lease and will result in rent expense of approximately  annually 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company of up to  shares of its common stock at an aggregate price not to exceed million 
in july  the company s board of directors authorized a second stock repurchase program by the company to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock 
under both plans  purchases by the company can be made from time to time in the open market or in private transactions 
the repurchase programs can be suspended or discontinued at any time 
shares repurchased by the company will be available for general corporate purposes  including the issuance upon exercise of stock options 
as of september   the company repurchased an aggregate of  shares of its common stock under the programs at a cost of million 
in april  the company provided joseph montgomery  the president and chief executive officer of the company  with a loan in the principal amount of million to enable him to meet certain tax obligations 
in june  the company agreed to provide mr 
montgomery with an additional loan in the principal amount of million for the purchase of certain real property  which loan has been combined with the previous million loan made in april the loan matures on august   at which time the entire principal balance is due 
the interest rate on the loan is set at the prime rate as published in the wall street journal from time to time  and the loan is secured by a pledge to the company of all of the shares of the company s common stock held by mr 
montgomery and by a mortgage on such real property 
as of september   a principal amount of million was outstanding under the loan 
the company has agreed to defer the interest payment of approximately  payable by mr 
montgomery to the company due august  pursuant to the terms of the loan 
under the terms of the deferral  mr 
montgomery is obligated to sell  shares of his stock in the company per quarter commencing in the company s third quarter of fiscal the net proceeds of such sales will be remitted to the company to pay the deferred interest 
the stock selling program by mr 
montgomery is subject to applicable securities laws and other restrictions which may preclude mr 
montgomery from selling a total of  shares per quarter 
this selling program will continue until the balance of the deferred interest is paid by mr 
montgomery in its entirety 
inflation is not a material factor affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
the company expects that cash flow generated by its operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its planned operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
accounting developments 
in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
defines the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which extends the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal quarters beginning after june  in fiscal  the company will assess how the provisions of this statement will affect its hedging operations and future earnings 
at this time  the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
on future earnings cannot be estimated 
year compliance 
the company has assessed its exposure to the year problem and has completed a comprehensive response to that exposure 
generally  the company has potential year exposures in three areas i financial and management operating computer systems used to manage the company s business  ii manufacturing equipment used by the company embedded chips and iii computer systems used by third parties  in particular customers and suppliers of the company 
the company performed an examination of its hardware and software applications to determine whether the systems it uses to operate its business are prepared to accommodate the year upon identifying the applications that required modification to accommodate year dating  the company initiated a program to modify the software using internal and third party service providers 
the company completed the programming changes to its software applications to accommodate year dating and the testing thereon  and completed the implementation of its year system modifications during the fourth quarter of fiscal in concert with the company s assessment and modification of its hardware and software applications  the company s examination of its year exposure also included the following the company contacted its hardware and software vendors to determine their year readiness  the company completed a survey of its major third party suppliers to determine their status with year compliance  and the company completed its examination of factory equipment with microprocessors to determine if year dating affects the equipment operationally 
the company spent approximately  in this effort 
the company increased its overall information technologies budget to accommodate year issues and has not delayed other information technology projects critical to the company s business as a result of the increase 
based on the company s examination of the year problem  its implementation of modifications to its internal systems  the representations made by its suppliers through its survey and the completion of its examination of factory equipment  the company does not anticipate that the year problem will have a material adverse impact on its operations 
however  if the company s changes are not successful in the remediation of non compliant operating systems or the correction of embedded chips or if customers or suppliers did not in fact rectify year issues applicable to them  the company is likely to incur substantial additional costs to develop alternative methods of managing its business and replacing non compliant equipment 
the company may also experience delays in payments by customers or to suppliers and delays in providing its products to customers 
the year problem is pervasive and complex and there can be no assurance that the company has been or will be able to identify all of the year issues that may affect the company or that any remedial efforts it takes will adequately address any potential year problems 
the euro 
on january   certain member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
between january  and january   transactions may be conducted in either the euro or the participating countries national currency 
however  by july   the participating countries will withdraw their national currency as legal tender and complete the conversion to the euro 
the company conducts business in europe and does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material adverse effect on its competitive position or consolidated financial position 
the company has completed the necessary system modifications that allow the company to conduct business in both the euro as well as the participating countries national currency 
recent developments in september  a major earthquake struck the country of taiwan 
several of cannondale s suppliers of bicycle components are located there 
due to the magnitude of the disaster  and the anticipated lack of certain components coming from these suppliers in taiwan  cannondale believes that there could be delays in the bicycle manufacturing process 
at this time  however  the extent of the adverse effect of this event on cannondale s business as a whole cannot be determined 
certain factors which may affect the company s future performance 
this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent the company s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  the following statements regarding the state of the bicycle industry and the growth opportunity pursued by the company with its motorcycle  statements regarding the sufficiency of the company s capital and current operational investments to finance its future growth  statements regarding the company s expected cash needs and sources of cash to fund its planned operating and capital requirements  statements regarding the impact of the company s brand image  distribution  reputation and innovative products on the successful introduction of new products  statements regarding expected remediation and other costs relating to an environmental condition  statements regarding the effect of pending lawsuits on the company  statements regarding the impact of the year issue and the euro conversion on computerized information systems  statements regarding the condition of the company s present facilities and the ability of its present facilities to support its current and future production capacity 
such statements are based upon the facts presently known to the company and assumptions as to important future events  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
among the more important factors which could adversely affect actual results of operations are the following seasonality 
the company s results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including product mix  the timing and number of new retailer openings  the timing of shipments and new product introductions  and the effect of adverse weather conditions on consumer purchases 
in addition  the company s business is highly seasonal due to consumer spending patterns  which in turn affect dealer delivery preferences  and historically has resulted in more shipments and significantly stronger results in the third and fourth fiscal quarters january through june 
the company s gross margins fluctuate primarily according to product mix  the cost of materials  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the timing of product price adjustments and markdowns 
although some operating expenses are variable with sales  most expenses are incurred evenly throughout the year 
it is unlikely that the seasonal nature of the business will change significantly in the future 
while the company was successful in reducing the impact of the seasonality during fiscal and  and in achieving profitable performances each quarter  the company in the past has incurred  and may in the future incur  operating losses in a fiscal quarter  as the business remains highly seasonal 
introduction of new products 
the company s ability to return to the growth pattern that characterized its operations in recent years is dependent  to a significant degree  on its ability to successfully anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner  including the introduction of new or updated products at prices acceptable to customers 
while currently a substantial part of the company s sales are attributable to mountain bikes  the introduction of new product lines  particularly its motorcycle  will provide diversification of the company s products 
the company s ability to recover its new product investments and earn a satisfactory profit thereon will depend on its ability to successfully produce the new products at acceptable cost levels and the satisfactory resolution of numerous design and manufacturing issues 
in addition  market acceptance of new products is difficult to predict and may require substantial marketing efforts 
competition 
competition in the high performance segment of the bicycle industry is based primarily on perceived value  brand image  performance features  product innovation and price 
competition in foreign markets may also be affected by duties  tariffs  taxes and the effect of various trade agreements  import restrictions and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the worldwide market for bicycles and accessories is extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of manufacturers in each of its product lines 
a number of the company s competitors are larger and have greater resources than the company 
the company competes on the basis of the breadth and quality of its product line  the development of an effective specialty retailer network and its brand recognition 
the motorcycle market is highly competitive 
the company s principal competitors will be foreign manufacturers with financial resources substantially greater than those of the company  that have established manufacturing capabilities  market and sell a product with strong brand recognition in the market and are more diversified than the company 
as a result of the foregoing  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully penetrate the motorcycle market 
foreign exchange rates 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
results of operations by these subsidiaries may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange ratio between the local currencies and the us dollar 
a substantial portion of the company s raw materials are purchased from overseas suppliers 
the gross margin of the company may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange ratio between the us dollar and the local currency of the supplier 
customer base 
sales of the company s products are made to specialty bicycle retailers  many of which are small businesses with limited capital 
the company s credit policies are designed to minimize the risks associated with business failures among such customers 
nevertheless  such unpredictable matters as poor weather could have a serious impact on important segments of the company s customer base 
the company is currently in the process of establishing its motor sport dealer network 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully establish a motor sport dealer network through which it would be able to recover its new product investments and earn a satisfactory profit thereon 
adverse weather 
the company s products are primarily used outdoors and therefore adverse weather conditions can have a negative impact on consumer demand 
reliance on key vendor and supplier relationships 
the company s ability to distribute its products on schedule is highly dependent on timely receipt of an adequate supply of components and materials 
the bicycles incorporate numerous components manufactured by other companies 
aluminum tubing  the primary material employed in the company s manufacturing operations  is available from a number of domestic suppliers 
the company has few long term agreements with its component manufacturers  and has no long term agreement with shimano  its largest single supplier  or with suppliers of many of the materials used in the manufacture of its products 
thus  the company s supply of materials and components from most of its current suppliers is not assured 
although the company believes it has established close relationships with the principal suppliers of these components  the company s future success will depend upon its ability to maintain flexible relationships  which may be terminated by such suppliers on short notice  or to substitute new suppliers without interruption of supply 
the loss of shimano or certain other key suppliers  or delays or disruptions in the delivery of components or materials  could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company has identified the majority of the suppliers that it will use to purchase the raw material parts and components for the manufacturing operations of its motorcycle 
during the process of identifying these vendors  the company has established strong relationships with key third party suppliers  however  the company has not yet entered into any long term supply contracts 
generally  the raw material parts and components needed to manufacture its motorcycle are available from a variety of sources  however  manufacturing operations may be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected by delays in the supply of parts or components from third party suppliers 
even if parts and components are available from alternative sources  the company may be subject to increased costs and production delays in connection with the replacement of an existing third party supplier with one or more alternative suppliers 
discretionary consumer spending 
purchases of bicycles and motorcycles  particularly high performance models including those manufactured by the company  and the company s other products are discretionary for consumers 
the success of the company is influenced by a number of economic factors affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the company s growth and profitability 
dependence on key personnel 
the company depends substantially on key personnel involved in the research and development  marketing  sales  finance and administration 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key persons  particularly the loss of the services of joseph s 
montgomery  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
executive officers of the company and other management personnel frequently travel between the company s executive offices and its manufacturing facility on an aircraft leased by the company 
an accident involving the corporate aircraft and resulting injury or loss of life could have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address these risks  the company enters into various hedging transactions as described below 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
credit risks 
the company s customer base is composed of specialty bicycle retailers which are located principally throughout the united states and europe 
the company s net sales are concentrated in the united states and germany 
no other single country accounted for more than of the company s net sales during fiscal  and no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales during fiscal  and as a result of the seasonality of the company s business  the payment terms offered to its bicycle dealers generally range from to days depending on the time of year and other factors 
foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the company enters into forward contracts to purchase and sell us  european  australian  canadian and japanese currencies to reduce exposures to foreign currency risk 
the company enters into forward foreign currency contracts for a significant portion of its current and net balance sheet exposures  principally relating to trade receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  and firm sale and purchase commitments 
the forward exchange contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require the company to exchange  at maturity  various currencies for us dollars and dutch guilders at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
the company does not hold foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes 
deferred gains and losses resulting from effective hedges of existing assets  liabilities or firm commitments are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and are recognized when the offsetting gains and losses are recognized on the related transaction 
the net gains losses explicitly deferred at july  and june  were not significant 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions that do not satisfy the accounting requirements of an effective hedge are reported currently as other income or expense 
the company uses borrowings of japanese yen and dutch guilders to hedge its net investments in its foreign subsidiaries 
gains and losses on hedges of net investments are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company also hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on its revolving credit facility 
on april   the company entered into two five year interest rate hedge agreements with a total notional principal amount of million to manage interest costs associated with changing interest rates 
these agreements convert underlying variable rate debt based on libor under the company s revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt with an interest rate of the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
