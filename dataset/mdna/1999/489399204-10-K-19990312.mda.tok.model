we provide property management and leasing services  asset management  commercial and residential brokerage  and auction services to clients primarily in the us and japan 
our clients include financial institutions  major corporations  real estate developers  insurance companies and governmental agencies 
we also invest in commercial and residential real estate  as well as individual and pools of distressed notes both in the us and japan 
our revenues in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
our net income in the same periods was million  million  and million  respectively 
in  we substantially increased our activities in japan  including a joint venture with an affiliate of colony capital  inc this joint venture provides a framework for the investment of up million  million of which would be invested by us  in japanese real estate and pools of distressed notes  of which approximately half has been invested to date 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement  we provide japanese real estate expertise and receive acquisition  management and disposition fees 
the joint venture agreement also requires us to provide of the required equity in any investment 
in addition  we made minority investments in brokerage and loan servicing businesses in japan and have expanded the size of our direct employee base in japan to nine real estate professionals 
as part of our strategy  we plan to grow our business in japan  continuing to emphasize fee based sources of income 
in furtherance of this strategy  we entered into a joint venture and strategic alliance with an affiliate of cargill  incorporated in march to invest in small and medium sized pools of distressed notes 
when we sell residential real property  we recognize as gross revenues the total sales price of residential real estate property and we recognize as an expense the purchase price and improvements associated with that real estate 
therefore  a sale of residential real property in any reported period has a disproportionate effect on revenues and expense in that period relative to sales of other investments and our other business lines 
our commercial real property investments are accounted for on a net gain on sale basis 
our growth was due principally to our acquisition of our property management and leasing company  heitman properties  ltd  in july we funded this acquisition with a million loan from colony k w  llc 
we made this acquisition as part of our strategy to increase recurring fee income as a percentage of total revenues 
we expect that this acquisition will be a platform for future growth of our property management business in both the us and japan 
we acquired heitman properties for million in cash and we accounted for this transaction under the purchase method of accounting  resulting in goodwill of million which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over years 
historically  we have purchased for our own account commercial and residential real estate in the us during   and  we acquired million  million  and million  respectively  of commercial properties  and million  million  and million  respectively  of residential properties

this increase is due to sales from four projects in  including a unit single family home development in north los angeles  seven units of a unit single family development in palm desert  and the bulk sale of a unit condominium project in west los angeles 
this compares to revenues in from the sale of units of a unit condominium project located in orange county  california  the sale of the remaining seven units in a condominium project in hawaii  and the sale of a land lot zoned for condominium development in beverly hills

equity in income of investments with related parties and affiliates and gain on sale of partnership increased in total to million in  or of total revenue  a increase from the million realized in the gain on sale of the partnership interest was million 
the increase was substantially due to the gain on the sale in of our interest in a joint venture that owned two commercial office buildings in downtown los angeles

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resources requirements include expenditures for real estate held for sale  distressed notes pools  the acquisition of property management portfolios  and working capital needs 
historically  we have not required significant capital resources to support our brokerage operations 
we finance our operations with internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving lines of credit as described below 
our investments in real estate are typically financed by mortgage loans secured primarily by that real estate 
these mortgage loans are generally nonrecourse in that  in the event of a default  recourse will be limited to the mortgaged property serving as collateral  subject to certain exceptions that are standard in the real estate industry 
exceptions where the lender may proceed against the borrower or guarantor  if any  generally include the voluntary transfer of the mortgaged property by the borrower  the voluntary initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the borrower  fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining the loan  and other similar acts 
cash provided by operating activities was about million in  compared to million in cash used in operating activities in the change included an increase in accounts receivable attributable primarily to the property management fees which are received one month in arrears  as well as leasing commissions earned but not received until the related tenant moves in  offset by increased accrued expenses which includes bonuses and deferred compensation 
the million cash used in operating activities in compares to  in cash provided by operating activities in the change resulted from an increase in in gains on sale of real estate  which are excluded from cash flows from operating activities  offset by an increase in accrued expenses

in addition  in  we purchased heitman properties  ltd 
for about million  which was allocated to contracts  furniture and fixtures  and goodwill 
the million in cash provided by investing activities in compares to cash used in investing activities in of million 
the change resulted primarily from proceeds from sale of real estate held for sale in the amount of million and collection of notes receivable of million  offset by purchases of real estate held for sale in the amount of million 
cash provided by financing activities was about million in  compared to cash used in financing activities in of about million 
the change resulted from million in mortgage loans payable related primarily to the purchase of the commercial properties referred to above 
in addition we issued million in subordinated debt related to the purchase of heitman properties  ltd 
the million in cash used in financing activities in compares to cash provided by financing activities of million in the change resulted from repayments of mortgage loans payable of million and repayment of notes payable of million 
prior to september  we had a million unsecured credit facility with east west bank with an interest rate of prime plus 
in september  we increased that facility to million with interest payable monthly at a rate of libor plus and a maturity date of june  we use this facility primarily for working capital purposes and acquisitions 
the outstanding balance on this facility was million as of december  in july  we entered into a bridge loan agreement with colony k w  llc that provided us with million in subordinated debt  the proceeds from which we utilized to consummate our acquisition of heitman properties  ltd 
this debt bears interest at a rate of  and the principal is payable in three installments of million due on july in each of  and as of december   we had million in mortgage notes payable 
we used proceeds from these loans to finance the acquisition of several commercial and residential properties  and are secured by both first and second mortgage liens 
all but million of these loans are non recourse against the borrower or guarantor  if any  except in certain circumstances that are standard in the real estate industry 
we plan to repay each note upon the sale of the corresponding secured property 
in june  we entered into a term loan agreement with fbr asset investment corporation which had an original principal amount of million bearing interest at per annum 
as of november  the loan terms were amended so that after december   the interest rate was per annum payable monthly plus per annum compounded monthly and payable at maturity and the loan was extended to june  however  we plan on refinancing this debt on or prior to maturity 
as of december  the outstanding principal balance was million 
we used the proceeds of this loan to purchase note pools 
to the extent that we engage in additional strategic investments  including real estate  note portfolio  or acquisitions of other property management companies  we may need to obtain third party financing which could include bank financing or the public sale or private placement of debt or equity securities 
we believe that existing cash  plus capital generated from property management and leasing  brokerage  sales of real estate owned  collections from notes receivable  as well as our current line of credit with east west bank  will provide us with sufficient capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our need  if any  to raise additional funds to meet our working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the success and pace of the implementation of our strategy for growth 
we regularly monitor capital raising alternatives to be able to take advantage of other available avenues to support our working capital and investment needs  including strategic partnerships and other alliances  bank borrowings  and the sale of equity or debt securities 
we intend to retain earnings to finance our growth and  therefore  do not anticipate paying any dividends 
recent developments on march   we executed a letter of intent relating to our proposed acquisition of a property management company 
the acquisition price is less than million 
we intend to finance a portion of this acquisition with borrowings under our east west bank line of credit 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its results from operations 
such provisions include escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the respective agreements 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the cpi or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases and management agreements are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents and fees at market rates if they are below then existing market rates 
many of our leases require the tenants to pay a pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities was issued june  applicable for all fiscal years beginning after june  at this time  management has not completed their analysis of this pronouncement s impact on the company s financial statements 
year issue it is difficult to estimate the impact the year issue may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on current testing  we have identified two primary systems affected by the year issue 
first  we rely upon information technology systems to run software for databases  accounting  word processing  e mail and other programs necessary to our business 
second  certain mechanical systems in the buildings we manage and own  such as fire safety systems  key card access devices and air conditioning and heating units  may be reliant  to some degree  on computer systems for various functions 
what is the state of readiness of our information technology systems in january   we formed an internal information services group that developed a plan to bring our information technology systems into year compliance by september   consisting of the following educate management of the nature and scope of the year issue  inventory all hardware and software systems which we use  scan these systems with two industry standard programs for year compliance and repair or replace those identified as non compliant  install a new computer network and server which will allow us to back up all of our data every evening  and test new systems in a non live environment by turning their internal clocks forward while monitoring and recording responses and hire outside consultants to audit and validate our results 
we project our new network will be up and running no later than june   and we presently anticipate to be through with all internal testing by september  we plan to have outside consultants perform and complete their valuation audit of our testing by the fourth quarter of we estimate based on current testing  that we will have to replace approximately computers of the in use at our five corporate offices 
most of the properties to which we provide property management services have computer terminals 
while these terminals will be tested  they will not be placed on our network 
we do not presently believe year compliance problems with these terminals will have a material adverse affect on our property management operations 
what is the state of readiness of our building systems in the first quarter of  we formed a year compliance task force to formulate and draft a year compliance program for the various properties we manage 
each individual property owner is ultimately responsible for assuring its properties are ready for year  and our role as property manager is limited to identifying potential problems and recommending remedial action 
however  we will make the necessary year renovations to the properties we own 
as of february   approximately of the properties under management in are participating in the year compliance program 
for those properties  we have substantially completed reviews of the preliminary inventories and testing and have submitted proposals to those owners 
we will contact owners of non participating buildings to determine if they would now like to participate in our year compliance program 
how does the year issue impact us we are not currently aware of any internal year problems that could be reasonably expected to have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the vendors from which we will acquire hardware and software for our new information technology system have indicated the products we plan to use are currently year compliant 
the current review of the preliminary systems inventories from our participating managed properties revealed few year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not discover year problems with our systems that will require their repair or replacement 
we cannot give assurances that third party software  hardware or services incorporated into our material systems  or systems upon which we are reliant  will not need to be revised or replaced  which could be time consuming and expensive 
in addition  we cannot give assurances that governmental agencies  utilities  third party service providers and others outside of our control will be year compliant 
the failure of such entities to become compliant could result in a systemic failure beyond our control  such as loss of telecommunications or electricity  which could adversely impact our information technology systems or may allow tenants at the buildings we own or manage to terminate leases if such failures persist 
what will it cost to implement the year plans we estimate that we will incur approximately  in our year compliance efforts  of which we have spent approximately  to date 
the majority of this amount will be spent on replacing hardware and software and on testing 
we have not had to defer any of our information technology plans as a result of our year preparations 
however  these estimates are based on our current assessment and are subject to change 
we will continue to assess our year issue compliance efforts and as a result  we may need to revise our budget to implement new measures in the future 
contingency plan we are currently developing a year contingency plan 
the results of current and future testing and responses of vendors  manufacturers and service providers will be taken into account in developing this plan
