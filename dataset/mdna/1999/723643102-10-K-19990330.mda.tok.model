item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company manufactures and markets chlorine  caustic soda  muriatic acid and related products used in a variety of applications  including water treatment  plastics  pulp and paper  detergents  agricultural chemicals  pharmaceuticals  and medical disinfectants 
chlorine and caustic soda are the seventh and sixth most commonly produced chemicals  respectively  in the united states  based on volume  and are used in a wide variety of applications and chemical processes 
caustic soda and chlorine are co products  concurrently produced in a ratio of approximately to  through the electrolysis of salt water 
an electrochemical unit ecu consists of tons of caustic soda and ton of chlorine 
chlorine is used to manufacture over  products  including approximately of all commercial chemistry  of all pharmaceutical chemistry and of all crop protection chemistry 
products manufactured with chlorine as a raw material include water treatment chemicals  plastics  detergents  pharmaceuticals  disinfectants and agricultural chemicals 
chlorine is also used directly in water disinfection applications 
in the united states and canada  virtually all public drinking water is made safe to drink by chlorination  and a significant portion of industrial and municipal waste water is treated with chlorine or chlorine derivatives to kill water borne pathogens and remove solids 
caustic soda is a versatile chemical alkali used in a diverse range of manufacturing processes  including metal smelting  oil production and refining and pulp and paper production 
caustic soda is combined with chlorine to produce bleach 
caustic soda is also used as an active ingredient in a wide variety of other end use products  including detergents  rayon and cellophane 
the chlorine and caustic soda markets have been  and are likely to continue to be  cyclical 
periods of high demand  high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to result in new plant investments and increased production until supply exceeds demand  followed by a period of declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle is repeated 
historically  chlorine demand has followed growth trends in polyvinyl chloride pvc  non vinyl polymers and water treatment markets  reduced by decreased chlorine use in the pulp and paper industry and as a feedstock in the production of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs due to regulatory pressures 
the markets for chlorine and caustic soda are affected by general economic conditions  both in north america and elsewhere in the world 
during  with the growing economic crisis in asia  and subsequently south america  supply of chlor alkali products exceeded demand  resulting in reduced pricing 
these markets had experienced steady growth through early chlorine prices rose from per ton in early to approximately at the end of and then  as a result of market pressures  dropped to approximately per ton at the end of continuance of these market conditions will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  two announced north american capacity increases will begin production during typically  as chlorine demand falls  the industry s operating rate decreases 
this results in demand for chlorine s co product  caustic soda  to exceed production  creating price increases for caustic soda 
however  due to the world wide economic conditions  particularly in the pulp and paper markets  demand for caustic soda fell 
as a result  these prices have not increased and are showing signs of weakening 
caustic soda prices approximated per ton during the latter half of  but were approximately per ton at the end of large quantities of chlorine are not typically stored  and therefore chlor alkali production rates are based on short term chlorine demand typically one month 
however  chlor alkali plants do not achieve optimum cost efficiency if production rates are cycled 
the maintenance of steady production rates is made difficult by the cyclical nature of the chlor alkali business  which is at times exacerbated because the market demand for chlorine differs from that of caustic soda 
the chlor alkali market has shifted from ecu buyers to independent markets  unlinking the markets for these two products 
peak and trough demand for chlorine and caustic soda rarely coincide and caustic soda demand  in the past  has tended to trail chlorine demand into and out of economic growth cycles 
railcars are often used to transport chlorine and caustic soda 
during  and continuing into  there was a lack of railcar availability due to the union pacific transportation problems experienced in the western united states 
this issue created problems surrounding the shipment of the products  resulting in lower sales and production during the periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data for the periods indicated dollars in thousands and percentages of revenues year ended december  revenues    cost of sales    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    unusual charges   operating income    interest expense  net    other income  net   income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item    income tax provision benefit   income loss before extraordinary item    extraordinary item  net of tax benefit  net income loss    the tacoma facility was acquired on june  and the business of pci canada was acquired on october  the results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of operations from the respective acquisition dates through december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or approximately to million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the acquisitions of the operations of pci canada in november and the tacoma facility in june accounted for this increase 
partially offsetting this increase were lower average ecu prices during the period  as compared to the company s average ecu sales price for the year ended december  was  a decrease of approximately from the average sales price of also  production volumes were reduced by two factors 
first  production and sales were hampered as a result of a lack of railcar availability in the western united states due to union pacific rail transportation problems 
second  production at the company s henderson plant fell in early because of three failed transformers  which are now fully operational 
revenues at the company s downstream operations decreased as the company disposed of its packaged household bleach operations during the third quarter and its pool chemicals business in the fourth quarter of also  competitive conditions and adverse weather conditions during the early portions of the year resulted in revenue decreases in the downstream businesses 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or in  as compared to the primary reason for this increase was the additional sales volume from the acquired operations 
in addition  unit production costs were higher during this was principally due to a increase in per unit power price in compared to partially offsetting these increases was lower cost of sales at the downstream businesses due to lower sales volumes 
gross profit gross profit margin decreased slightly to approximately in from in  primarily as a result of depressed ecu net sales prices  offset in part by the operating efficiencies of the acquired businesses 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the business of pci canada 
unusual charges unusual charges in included approximately million related to the disposition of all pure s pool chemicals business at city of industry  california 
also  a charge of approximately million was taken for the consolidation and downsizing of certain administrative functions of all pure and kemwater 
substantially all accrued unusual charges were expended by december interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million to million in as a direct result of the debt incurred for the acquisitions of the tacoma facility and the business of pci canada 
partially offsetting this was lower interest expense from refinancing the million of first mortgage notes at substantially lower interest rates in june other income  net other income  net in included the receipt of cash dividends of million from the company s partnership interest in saguaro power company  a gain from the settlement of a lawsuit for approximately million  a gain from a business interruption insurance claim at the henderson plant related to the failed transformers and a state franchise tax refund 
offsetting this was a million loss on disposal of all pure s pool chemical business 
extraordinary item from early extinguishment of debt during  the company recognized an million extraordinary item net of tax benefit of million from early extinguishment of the first mortgage notes 
the extraordinary loss consisted primarily of the premium paid on the face value of the notes and the write off of debt placement fees related to the notes 
net loss net loss for the twelve months ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased by million  or approximately to million for  as compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the additional sales volumes from the tacoma facility that was acquired on june  and the pci canada acquisition  effective october  partially offsetting this increase were lower sales volumes from the company s henderson and st 
gabriel plants and lower ecu pricing 
average ecu prices  excluding the impact of acquisitions  decreased approximately  or per ton 
caustic soda prices fell approximately or per ton  while chlorine pricing rose  or approximately per ton 
caustic soda sales volume from the henderson and st 
gabriel plants decreased due to a reduction in exchange activity and lower production rates 
the henderson plant had lower production rates in late because of failed transformers and a lack of railcar availability due to the union pacific transportation problems experienced in the western united states 
in total  revenues at the downstream operations were fairly constant 
cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or in versus the acquisition of the tacoma facility and the pci canada acquisition accounted for the majority of this increase 
also  higher electrical costs contributed to increased cost of sales 
cost of sales at the downstream operations increased as a result of higher costs of raw materials  partially offset by decreases resulting from lower sales volumes 
gross profit gross profit margin decreased to in from in as a result of revenues and cost of sales fluctuations described above 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions during and additional pay for performance awards at pcac 
pci canada s expenses were million for the two months of its activities 
pcac s expenses increased somewhat as a result of the tacoma acquisition 
unusual charges in  due to continued operating losses  an unusual charge of million was recorded to reduce the carrying values of certain of kemwater s assets  based upon management s expectations of net realizable value 
also in  an unusual charge of million was recorded relating to the closure of certain of all pure s plants and the consolidation of their operations to other locations 
interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million to million in from million in this increase was the result of the debt incurred for the pci canada acquisition and the tacoma acquisition  partially offset by lower interest expense from refinancing million of first mortgage notes at substantially lower interest rates 
other income  net other income  net  during includes a million accrual for a business interruption insurance claim at pcac s henderson plant 
income loss before taxes and extraordinary item as a result of the above  income before income taxes and extraordinary item decreased million to a loss of million versus income of million in extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt during the second quarter of  the company recognized an million extraordinary loss as a result of the early extinguishment of the first mortgage notes 
the extraordinary loss consisted primarily of the premium paid on the face value of the notes and the write off of debt placement fees related to the notes net of tax benefit of million 
net income due to the factors described above  net loss for was million  compared to net income of million in liquidity and capital resources financial leverage and covenants 
as of december   the company had million of long term debt outstanding 
while the majority of the company s debt is due in and  the company is required to make certain scheduled payments each year 
the degree to which the company is indebted could have important consequences including  but not limited to i limitations on the ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes and other purposes  if needed  ii the allocation of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to cover cash interest requirements  thereby limiting the funds available for operations and any future business opportunities  and iii increasing the company s vulnerability to a downturn in its business or the economy 
pioneer s cash requirements include payment of interest on the notes issued in connection with the pioneer acquisition 
pai is restricted in paying dividends to pioneer or funding cash to unrestricted subsidiaries  as defined  to the sum of million plus of the cumulative consolidated net income of pai since june as of december   no distributions were allowable under this covenant 
however  management believes that the existing cash balances at pioneer and its unrestricted subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund future required interest payments and other cash requirements until such time that pai s cumulative consolidated net income is positive 
pai s ability to enter into new debt agreements is restricted by a debt covenant requiring a minimum interest coverage ratio as defined of at least to for the prior four fiscal quarters 
currently  pai is unable to incur additional indebtedness as a result of this covenant  other than borrowing available under its revolving credit facility 
the company s debt agreements contain other restrictions on pai s subsidiaries  which  among other things  limit the ability of pai s subsidiaries to acquire or dispose of assets or operations 
annualized cash interest of approximately million is payable on the company s long term debt 
to the extent that the company draws upon the commitments under the revolving credit facility  due to adverse business conditions or to finance acquisitions or for other corporate purposes  the company s aggregate interest expense would be increased 
revolving facility 
in november  pai entered into an amended million credit agreement that provides for a five year revolving loan and letter of credit facility subject to borrowing base limitations that relate to the level of accounts receivable and inventory the revolving facility 
the revolving facility provides for revolving loans the revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount up to million which includes a us million canadian sub facility available to pci canada  and which is also subject to borrowing base limitations 
as of december   the company had letters of credit outstanding of approximately million and had the ability to draw up to million of additional indebtedness 
the company had no revolving loans outstanding at december  and no amounts outstanding under the canadian sub facility 
in march  the company modified its existing million revolving facility to million the amended revolving facility 
borrowing under the amended revolving facility will require a minimum interest coverage ratio of at least to from october  to march  for the prior twelve months or on a year to date basis  whichever is higher subject to a borrowing base limitation that relates to the level of accounts receivable 
failure to maintain a coverage ratio of to for fifteen consecutive months would constitute an event of default 
capital and environmental expenditures 
total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for environmental related matters at existing facilities were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for  excluding any acquisitions  will be approximately million  including million for environmental compliance matters 
also within the total anticipated capital expenditures is approximately million for the completion of a chlorine pipeline from the st 
gabriel plant to the facilities of several major customers 
the company routinely incurs operating expenditures associated with hazardous substance management and environmental compliance matters in ongoing operations 
these operating expenses include items such as outside waste management  fuel  electricity and salaries 
the amounts of these operating expenses were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the company does not anticipate an increase in these types of expenses during the company classifies these types of environmental expenditures within cost of sales 
net operating loss carryforward 
at december   the company had for income tax purposes approximately million of us net operating loss carryforward nol which expires in through  and million of foreign nol available expiring 
the nol is available for offset against future taxable income generated during the carryforward period 
foreign operations and exchange rate fluctuations 
the company  through pci canada  has operating activities in canada  and the company engages in export sales to various countries 
international operations and exports to foreign markets are subject to a number of risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  political risks and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing foreign based companies 
in addition  earnings of foreign subsidiaries and intracompany payments are subject to foreign taxation rules 
a portion of the company s sales and expenditures are denominated in canadian dollars  and accordingly  the company s results of operations and cash flows may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
in addition  because a portion of the company s revenues  cost of sales and other expenses are denominated in canadian dollars  the company has a translation exposure to fluctuation in the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
due to the significance of pci canada s us dollar denominated long term debt and related accrued interest payable and certain other us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  the entity s functional accounting currency is the us dollar 
currently  the company is not engaged in forward foreign exchange contracts  but may enter into such hedging activities in the future 
preferred stock 
during   shares of the company s convertible redeemable preferred stock  par value per share  were issued in connection with the acquisition of the tacoma facility 
each share of preferred stock is convertible at the option of the shareholder into shares of the company s class a common stock 
in addition  the stock may be redeemed at varying premiums either at the company s option or upon the occurrence of certain designated events 
working capital 
working capital was fairly constant in  ending the year at million versus the december balance of million 
decreased sales revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in caused accounts receivable to fall  while controls placed over expenditures during the latter portion of  plus the timing of payments  created offsetting decreases in current liabilities 
net cash flows from operating activities 
while the company produced a loss of million during the year ended december   the year s results included million of non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
cash generated from operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  versus million in the year ended december  net cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  as compared to million in this decrease was due to cash used in for acquisitions  including million for the acquisition of the tacoma facility and million for the pci canada acquisition 
in  investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million 
net cash flows from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities in was million  versus inflows of million in the cash usage was due to scheduled debt repayments  partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock 
in  the positive cash inflow from financing activities was a result of the new debt issued in connection with the pci canada acquisition and the acquisition of the tacoma facility 
year issues 
the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive data by the company s computerized information systems 
the year may be critical to these systems as many computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer applications that have date sensitive programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures in the manufacturing area that could cause serious production related issues 
in addition  miscalculations or system failures could result in a temporary inability to process transactions  issue invoices  remit payments  communicate with financial institutions and other entities electronically and update internal accounting systems 
if not corrected in a timely manner  such business disruptions would be detrimental to the continuing operations of the company 
the company has initiated a program to prepare its computer systems and applications for the year based on present information  management believes that while many of the systems are already year compliant  other systems will require modification or replacement with new programs 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  replace and test software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year conversion tasks by july the total project costs are presently estimated not to exceed million  to be obtained through working capital  and will be expensed as incurred unless new software is purchased  in which case certain costs will be capitalized 
the company is taking steps to identify year compliance issues that may be created by key customers  suppliers and financial institutions with which the company does business 
while no single customer represents greater than of the company s revenues  the company does have several large customers who each account for a sizable dollar amount of sales revenue 
the company s significant vendors include electrical power companies  salt companies  and freight companies 
the loss of any key customer or the inability of any of the company s key vendors to provide its goods and services to the company would have a negative impact on the company s operations until those entities return to normal operations 
the anticipated future costs of the year conversion project and the date on which the company anticipates project completion are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could vary significantly from current estimates 
the company is developing a written contingency plan which will be completed by july to address unforeseen issues related to the year the company believes that in an emergency situation it could revert to the use of manual systems that do not rely on computers 
through these manual systems  the company could perform the minimum functions required to maintain the flow of goods and provide a minimum level of information reporting to maintain a level of control over the business cycle 
should the company have to utilize manual systems  it is uncertain that it could maintain current levels of operations and this could have a material adverse impact on the business 
the company intends to maintain constant surveillance on the year issues and will adapt its plans as required 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides a framework for determining the accounting treatment of costs incurred to obtain or develop computer software 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sop beginning in  without adjustment to previously reported amounts 
in april  the aicpa issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop  which requires immediate expensing of certain organization costs and start up costs 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sop in in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in the third quarter of management does not believe the adoption of the above mentioned accounting changes will have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has certain long term debt instruments that are subject to market risk 
at december   approximately million of the company s debt had variable interest rates  including libor and us prime rate based loans 
an increase in the market interest rates would increase the company s interest expense and its cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase the company s interest expense and payments by approximately million 
the company s remaining debt instruments  totaling approximately million at december   are at various fixed interest rates ranging from to  with the majority at 
the company  through pci canada  operates in canada and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
due to the significance of pci canada s us dollar denominated long term debt and related accrued interest payable and certain other us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  the entity s functional accounting currency is the us dollar 
certain other items within pci canada s working capital are denominated in canadian dollars 
an average change of in the currency exchange rate would change total assets by million
