overview on august   cbw  inc purchased of elmer s restaurants  inc then outstanding common stock from its then president and chairman  ms 
anita goldberg  and her brother and director  rudolph mazurosky 
on february   elmer s restaurants  inc merged with cbw  inc 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these transactions have been accounted for as a purchase of elmer s restaurants  inc by cbw  inc 
and accordingly a new basis of accounting  based on fair values  was established for the assets and liabilities of elmer s restaurants  inc the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of cbw  inc for the years ended march  and rather than the previously reported results of elmer s and include the accounts of cbw  inc for the year ended march  and of elmer s restaurants  inc for the period august  through march  with a minority interest in the income through february  representing the separate public ownership  as well as the assets and liabilities of grass valley ltd  inc  which was acquired as of march  because of the significance of these transactions  the company believes that a discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations on a pro forma basis  which include results of operations of elmer s restaurants  inc and grass valley ltd  inc provides a more meaningful comparison than the discussion and analysis of actual results of operations which  prior to these transactions  only includes the results of operations of cbw  inc and supplements the following highlights of historical results

per share for the year ended march   on sales of approximately  after taking into account the pro forma income tax provision as if the company had been a taxable company for the entire year  the company reported net income  net of pro forma income tax provision  of approximately  or 
per share for the year ended march  compared to approximately  of net income  net of pro forma income tax provision  or

there are no operating results from the gvl acquisition reflected in the company s actual results of operations for the year ended march  during the year ended march   total assets increased million to million 
this increase is due primarily to the assets related to elmer s restaurants  inc totaling approximately million and the acquisition of grass valley ltd  inc for approximately million

pro forma results of operations as discussed above  the company believes that discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations on a pro forma basis  which include cbw  inc and grass valley ltd  inc  provides a more meaningful comparison than the discussion and analysis of reported actual results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis presents the company s results of operations for the years ended march   and  as if the merger of cbw  inc and the acquisition of grass valley ltd  inc  had occurred at the beginning of the periods after giving effect to pro forma adjustments  including amortization of goodwill  depreciation  interest expense  and related income tax effects

the significant increase in other current assets and other current liabilities is primarily the result of the merger of cbw  inc and elmer s restaurants  inc and the acquisition of grass valley ltd  inc 
the company s primary liquidity needs arise form debt service on indebtedness incurred in connection with the merger of cbw  inc  operating lease requirements and the funding of capital expenditures 
as of march   the company had outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money of million under a term loan facility and million real estate loan facilities with wells fargo bank and million under a term loan facility with eagle s view management  assumed at the time of the merger with cbw  inc the wells fargo loans have a weighted average maturity of years  bear interest at an average of  require monthly payments of principal and interest  are collateralized by substantially all of the assets owned by elmer s restaurants  inc and impose certain financial restrictions and covenants  the most restrictive of which  require the company to maintain a maximum of total liabilities  excluding subordinated debt  to tangible net worth plus subordinated debt of to the company was in compliance with this covenant at march  in addition  effective september   and thereafter on a trailing four quarter basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter  the company will be required to maintain a ratio of cash generation to total interest expense plus the prior period current maturities of long term debt of at least to the company also has available a  line of credit with wells fargo bank through september  the eagle s view management loan has a maturity of approximately years  an interest rate of  requires monthly payments of interest only  and is collateralized by a second position on substantially all the assets owned by elmer s restaurants  inc and does not impose financial covenants upon the company 
the company s primary source of liquidity during the year was the operation of the restaurants  franchise fees earned from its franchisees  internal cash and borrowings as discussed above 
in the future  the company s liquidity and capital resources will primarily depend on the operations of elmer s restaurants  inc  cbw  inc 
and grass valley ltd  inc 
which  under the provisions of the company s loan agreements  would permit  under certain conditions  distributions and dividends to the company s shareholders and early reduction of the eagle s view management indebtedness 
elmer s restaurants  inc  cbw  inc 
and grass valley ltd  inc  like most restaurant businesses  are able to operate with nominal or deficit working capital because sales are for cash and inventory turnover is rapid 
renovation and or remodeling of existing restaurants is either funded directly from available cash or  in some instances  is financed through outside lenders 
construction or acquisition of new restaurants is generally  although not always  financed by outside lenders 
construction or acquisition of new restaurants is generally  although not always  financed by outside lenders 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms for new restaurant construction and acquisitions and that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its financial needs and to pay operating expenses for the foreseeable future  although no assurances can be given 
effects of year the company has completed its assessment of internal systems and has concluded that its hardware and software are year compliant 
the company has concluded that it will not be necessary to replace its retail point of sale hardware and that  based on information available at this time  the remaining costs to implement the year readiness program will not be material 
communication with respect to year issues with the company s suppliers is ongoing 
while not expected  the company may experience delays in receipt of product  which could adversely affect sales and earnings 
the company cannot currently estimate to what extent future operating results might be adversely affected by the possible failure of these third parties to successfully address their year issues 
however  the company s program includes actions designed to identify and minimize where possible  any third party exposure 
the distribution centers that deliver products to the restaurants maintain an adequate inventory to supply items for approximately weeks 
if suppliers are unable to deliver product to the distribution centers due to year or other plant malfunctions  alternative suppliers are currently being identified that could deliver product that matches the company s specifications 
there can be no assurance that additional costs will not be incurred  or that the objective of the program will be achieved 
however  the company continues to monitor activities related to the program designed to ensure year readiness 
inflation certain of the company s operating costs are subject to inflationary pressures  of which the most significant are food and labor costs 
as of march   a significant percentage of the company s employees were paid wages equal to or based on the state minimum hourly wage rates 
economic growth that would reduce unemployment or make more jobs available in higher paying industries could directly affect the company s labor costs 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal substantial increases in costs could have a significant impact on the company and the industry 
if operating expenses increase  management believes it can recover increased costs by increasing prices to the extent deemed advisable considering competition 
seasonality the seasonality of restaurant sales due to consumer spending habits can be significantly affected by the timing of advertising  competitive market conditions and weather related events 
while restaurant sales for certain quarters can be stronger  or weaker  there is no predominant pattern
