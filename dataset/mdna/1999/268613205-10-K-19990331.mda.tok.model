year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result these programs may not properly recognize the year and subsequent dates and errors may result 
the company has instituted a program to identify these computer programs and modify or replace its systems so that they will function properly in the year as well as any non information technology systems in place 
during  the restaurant division installed new accounting systems that are fully operational and are year compliant 
individual restaurant locations do not currently utilize point of sale registers and therefore computer programming changes are not required 
peripheral hardware and software and equipment at each restaurant location and the restaurant head office are being evaluated for year compliance 
cues is currently in the testing phase of its manufacturing and accounting software  which is the critical component for the planning  purchasing  manufacturing and sale of its products 
all known functions within the software have been rewritten to be year compliant 
within various departments  cues also utilizes computer hardware and peripheral programs that are separate and distinct from the accounting and manufacturing software 
examples include programs related to engineering design  spreadsheets  word processing  sales database tracking  etc 
while not as critical to the ongoing nature of the business  cues is currently assessing the effect of year on each hardware and software component 
cues does not utilize any computer aided machinery in its production process 
the company is in the process of initiating and assessing formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to potential third parties failures to remediate their own year issues 
it is in the interest of the company to use this information to mitigate these risks 
however  because of the complexity of this issue  the company can give no assurances that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be remedied for the year issue on time or that a failure to remedy the problem by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
plans are therefore under development in order to attempt to mitigate the extent of such potential adverse effects 
the company is expensing the costs to modify or replace computer applications as incurred  the majority of which are being handled internally utilizing its normal information technology budget and personnel 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases in costs due to year conversions nor does it anticipate any decrease in the information technology budget upon completion of the conversion efforts 
the company will continue to incur salary expense  while the efforts of personnel will be directed towards other ongoing information technology projects in based on the above  management does not anticipate that the cost of achieving year compliance will exceed  and therefore will not have a material impact on the company s operation  financial condition or liquidity
