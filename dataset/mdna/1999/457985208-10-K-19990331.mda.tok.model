as a result of the company s acquisition of rystan company  inc rystan in september  the company s consolidated financial results for and may not be directly comparable 
the company s financial information discussed below should be considered in light of i the company s sale of the panafil r product line on january  and ii the company s acquisition of the neurocare group of companies on march  see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements under item of this report

total revenues increased from million in to million in  due largely to increases in other revenues 
product sales increased from million to million and included  in sales from rystan in the fourth quarter of sales of integra r artificial skin integra declined slightly from million in to million in integra sales in north america declined by  as the company reduced its selling and marketing efforts in north america 
in  the number of north american burn centers and hospitals that used integra declined from to as the company s selling and marketing efforts were focused on the largest burn centers which handle the majority of severe burn cases 
the company s export sales increased to million of total sales as integra export sales increased by  due to increased international distribution efforts 
integra received ce mark certification in march  which included a broader indication of use than currently granted in the united states 
the company s international sales include integra sales to over countries throughout the world 
the primary application of integra in north america has been for patients with severe life threatening burns 
the company is in the process of collecting clinical results on integra s application in reconstructive and wound healing procedures and is continuing to focus its strategy on expanding the approved indications for use of integra in the united states 
the company believes these results demonstrate that integra can offer improved clinical results compared to existing treatments for relief of painful scars  wound contractures and hypertrophic scarring 
the company believes that its ability to increase the use of the product will require an increase in marketing and selling effort for the product  as well as the receipt of regulatory approvals for broader indiciations of use 
sales in the company s medical products segment decreased from million in to million in due largely to discontinued product lines 
the company ceased production and sale of its private label ophthalmic product line in and suspended operations at its leased west chester  pennsylvania facility in january  which resulted in an elimination of production for its avian collagen wound care product line and its contract manufacturing activities 
the company s ophthalmic  avian collagen and contract manufacturing revenues accounted for  in compared to minimal amounts in this decline was offset by increases in the company s infection control and surgical and hemostasis product lines 
customers representing greater than of sales included two customers with aggregate sales of and in and  respectively 
because significant portions of the company s medical products segment sales are made to marketing partners and distributors  quarter to quarter sales in medical products can vary significantly 
other revenue  which includes grant revenue  license fees  contract development revenue and royalties  increased from  in to million in licensing revenue and development funding had the greatest increases with each increasing by million due to the company s licensing and development agreements with century medical  inc and depuy  a johnson johnson company depuy  respectively 
grant revenue also increased by  as the company initiated work under its second three year million national institute of science and technology nist grant 
the company expects to continue to focus its efforts to obtain additional funding through research grants  licensing arrangements and development alliances  although the timing and amount of such revenue  if any  can not be predicted 
in addition  the second phase of the development agreement with depuy requires that a specific milestone be achieved before additional funding is received 
cost of product sales increased from million of product sales in to million of product sales in and included  related to the fair value purchase accounting adjustment for rystan s inventory in excluding the rystan purchase adjustment  the company s cost of product sales in was of product sales 
lower operating costs due to the closing of the company s west chester  pennsylvania production facility were largely offset by higher unit costs and royalty expense for integra 
due to the relatively high fixed costs of the manufacturing facility for integra  the company is anticipating higher unit costs until there is higher production volume 
the company believes its current capacity to produce integra and its other medical products is sufficient to support significant growth  and the utilization of this capacity will affect its gross margin on product sales 
the company is anticipating a continued temporary decline in gross margins for the first quarter of primarily related to the fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustment associated with the rystan acquisition 
research and development expense increased from million in to million in increases in research and development expenditures associated with funding levels for the company s cartilage research programs with j j depuy and nist represented the largest increases 
in addition  the company increased expenditures related to its clinical efforts for its duragen tm and integra products as well as pre clinical costs associated the company s absorbable biocompatible polymer program 
continuing expenditures include costs associated with efforts focusing on combining the company s biomaterials technologies with its integrin mediated technologies acquired in the telios acquisition 
the company expects the level of research and development expenditures in to be at or higher than levels depending on the company s ability to obtain outside funding for its programs 
the amount of resources allocated to fund particular research and development efforts will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the progress of development of the company s technologies  changing competitive conditions and determinations with respect to the commercial potential of the company s technologies 
selling and marketing expense increased from million in to million in and included  in selling and marketing costs in the fourth quarter with the addition of rystan

sales in the company s medical products segment decreased from million in to million in decreases in the company s infection control and surgical and hemostasis product lines were partially offset by increases in its dental product line and other contract manufacturing 
the dental product line increase was the result of increased orders from the company s marketing partner for the biomend product  which was introduced in august the decrease in the surgical and hemostasis product line  which includes products sold to marketing partners and products marketed directly  was due to lower unit volume from international distributors and customers 
during  the company s distribution agreement for its ophthalmic products was terminated  and the company has discontinued the product line 
in january  the company decided to suspend operations at its leased west chester  pennsylvania facility  and as a result discontinued its avian collagen wound care product line and its contract manufacturing activities 
the company s ophthalmic  avian collagen and contract manufacturing revenues accounted for less than of product sales in and customers representing greater than of sales included two customers with aggregate sales of in and three customers with aggregate sales of in because significant portions of the company s medical products segment sales are sold to marketing partners and distributors  quarter to quarter sales can vary significantly

liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through private and public offerings of its common stock  revenues from sales of existing products  research grants from government agencies  development and licensing agreements with major industrial companies  borrowings under a revolving credit line and cash acquired in connection with the business acquisitions 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million representing a million decrease from december  the principal uses of funds during were million for operations and million in purchases of property and equipment 
the company issued  shares of series a preferred stock series a preferred for million during the second quarter of the series a preferred shares carry an annual dividend of and are each convertible into one half of one share of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company acquired million in cash in connection with the acquisition of rystan in september in january  the company sold its panafil r product line  including the brand name and related equipment  to healthpoint  ltd 
for million in cash 
integra also is entitled to receive the first million of panafil r sales specifically to the podiatry market and certain hospitals with burn centers 
the company intends to move rystan s remaining operations to its plainsboro  new jersey facility by july on march   the company acquired the business  including certain assets and liabilities  of the neurocare group of companies  a leading provider of neurosurgical products  for million  comprised of million of cash and million of assumed indebtedness under a term loan from fleet capital corporation fleet

all interest is payable monthly 
principal payments under the term loan are payable on a quarterly basis through january  in addition  a commitment fee at an annual rate of of is payable monthly on the average unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the company anticipates it will continue to use its liquid assets to fund operations until sufficient revenues can be generated through product sales and collaborative arrangements 
the company believes that current cash balances and funds available from the fleet revolving credit facility and existing revenue sources will be sufficient to finance the company s anticipated operations for at least the next twelve months 
the company may in the future seek to issue equity securities or enter into other financing arrangements with strategic partners to raise funds in excess of its anticipated liquidity and capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient revenues to obtain profitability or raise additional funding in equity or debt transactions 
factors that may affect future results of operations the company believes that the following important factors  among others  have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s results of operations and could cause the company s future results to differ materially from its historical results and those expressed in any forward looking statements made by the company 
o the company has developed by acquiring or securing a number of companies and technologies 
there are certain risks associated with business and technology acquisitions  including incorrectly assessing the value of assets and future prospects  the extent of possible liabilities and the anticipated costs of incorporating acquired businesses into the company 
although the company is frequently in discussions with others relating to possible technology acquisitions and related matters  it does not currently have any agreement with respect to any acquisitions or any material technology transfers other than those described in this annual report 
because these types of transactions involve risks and could involve the issuance of the company s equity  any business or technology acquisition could have a material affect on the company s business 
the company s recent acquisition of the neurocare group of companies represents a significant acquisition  and the company s ability to integrate and manage the business will probably have a significant impact on the future results of the company 
o the ability of integra neurocare to fund its debt service obligations under the credit agreement will depend upon its future operating performance  which is subject to the success of its business strategy  prevailing economic conditions  regulatory matters  levels of interest rates and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
although the company is not a guarantor of such indebtedness  the current debt service obligations of integra neurocare could have important consequences for both integra neurocare and the company  including i the ability of the company or integra neurocare to obtain additional financing for future working capital needs  for possible future acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  ii a substantial portion of integra neurocare s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on its indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and iii integra neurocare and the company will be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than some of its competitiors and may be limited in its ability to withstand competitive pressures 
if integra neurocare s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations  it may be forced to reduce or delay planned expansion and capital expenditures  sell assets  or restructure its debt 
there can be no assurance that integra neurocare s operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to repay its indebtedness 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  integra neurocare could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet its debt service and other obligations  and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such sales or the proceeds that integra neurocare could realize therefrom 
in addition  should any of the above conditions arise for integra neurocare  the company could be negatively impacted by such events 
o the company believes that its integra product represents a relatively new method of treatment  and as such  it is difficult to estimate the potential market and potential revenue growth for the product 
the company also believes that integra provides a substantial enhancement over existing treatment alternatives for its current indication  which is the treatment of severe burns 
the company believes that integra provides longer term financial savings and other health benefits by reducing the number of required procedures and the patient s length of hospital stay 
however  the cost of the product does require the healthcare provider to incur a higher initial cost than is customary under most treatment options 
in addition  the health care industry in general is under continued cost containment pressures from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
should the company be unable to demonstrate these savings to the healthcare provider market and others  the company may experience lower than anticipated revenue growth and a resulting adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
o because a significant portion of the company s historical medical product sales have been to a small number of marketing partners  the loss of one of these customers could have a negative impact on revenues 
the company also depends on third party distributors for several products domestically and internationally 
the company s revenues and gross profit margins for these products are dependent on the continuing efforts of these marketing partners and third party distributors 
the company believes that its current relationships with customers regarding these products is satisfactory 
the company is also limited in its marketing and selling resources  which may or could make it ineffective in any direct marketing efforts 
o there can be no assurance that the company s planned research and development efforts will lead to commercially successful products 
many of the company s technologies are in the early stages of development and will require the commitment of substantial additional resources by the company and its potential strategic partners prior to commercialization 
their can be no assurance that any such potential products will be successfully developed on a timely basis  if at all  be safe and effective in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards and receive necessary regulatory approvals  be produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully marketed and achieve customer acceptance 
there can also be no assurance that the company s current plans for clinical trials to expand the indication of use for integra will result in an expanded indication or achieve a greater market acceptance 
costs due to regulatory delays or demands  unexpected adverse side effects or insufficient therapeutic effectiveness would prevent or significantly slow development and commercialization efforts and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company has filed a k premarket notification for its duragen tm product with the fda for marketing approval in the us the company currently anticipates a us launch of duragen tm by the third quarter of and any delays in this launch could have a negative effect on the company s operating results 
o the company depends substantially on its ability to obtain patents by license or otherwise  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain  involves many complex legal  factual and technical issues and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to the company s products and technologies will result in patents being issued  that patents issued or licensed by the company will provide protection against competitors or that the company will enjoy patent protection for any significant period of time 
the company is currently involved in a patent infringement lawsuit 
this litigation  as well as any possible future litigation  can be lengthy and expensive  and there can be no assurance as to the timing  cost or eventual outcome of such litigation 
the company s business may be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in protecting its patents and proprietary rights 
in addition  the company is involved in a lawsuit in which the defendant has made a counterclaim for damages that  if decided against the company  could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
the company believes this counterclaim is without merit and will continue its defense against this counterclaim 
see item legal proceedings of this report 
o the markets for the company s actual and proposed products and their intended use are characterized by rapidly changing technology 
competition in the general area of medical technology is intense and is expected to increase 
there are many companies in the medical field that have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities than the company 
there is a risk that technological developments will render actual and proposed products or technologies of the company non competitive  uneconomical or obsolete 
as a result  the company s growth and future financial performance depend in part upon its ability to introduce new products and enhance existing products to meet the latest technological advances 
failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and market factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the above factors are not meant to represent an exhaustive list of the risks and uncertainties associated with the company s business 
these factors as well as other factors may affect the company s future results and the company s stock price  particularly on a quarterly basis 
finally  because the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  its stock price is often subject to significant volatility 
year disclosure as is true for most companies  the potential for problems involving existing information systems as we approach and pass january  creates a risk for the company 
these potential problems are the result of the inability of certain date sensitive computer programs and embedded controls to recognize a two digit date field designated as as the year instead of the year  the consequences of which could lead to system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to operations and normal business activities 
this is a significant issue with far reaching implications  some of which cannot be anticipated or predicted with any degree of certainty as is commonly referred to as a year yk compliance issue 
the company has completed its initial assessment of the magnitude of the impact of yk on itself and is currently in the process of developing  implementing and monitoring a yk correction plan in all areas identified as potentially compromised by the advent of the yk 
this correction plan includes i the assessment of information technology systems it systems and non it systems for yk compliance  ii the modification and or replacement of non compliant systems  iii the testing of modified and or replaced systems  and iv the deployment of yk compliant systems 
in most cases  the company anticipates that the yk correction plan will include upgrading current hardware and software or purchasing additional hardware and software to enhance its current it systems 
since january   integra has spent approximately  upgrading and or replacing certain components of its information systems 
integra anticipates spending an additional  on such it system upgrades and purchases through december  the majority of the capital expenditures and operating costs associated with these upgrades and purchases would have occurred in the normal course of business regardless of the yk issue  although a portion of such expenditures and costs is attributable to the company s yk correction plan 
the company expects that the upgrades and purchases will be implemented and tested by june and that  in any event  its it systems will be yk compliant before december  the company is currently on track with its planned upgrades 
the company has been reviewing and has requested assurances on the status of yk readiness of its critical suppliers 
many of these suppliers however  have limited assurances on their status on the yk readiness 
the company plans to continue to monitor critical suppliers during the company has reviewed information regarding its major customers to assess their readiness for yk 
if a significant number of suppliers and customers experience disruptions as a result of the yk issue  this could have a material adverse effect on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
although the company is formulating contingency plans to deal with yk problems on critical suppliers and major customers  there can be no assurance that these plans will address all yk problems or that the implementation of these plans will be successful 
the company s products do not contain any materials that would make such products susceptible to disruptions relating to the yk 
given the information available at this time  integra currently anticipates that the amount that integra will spend to complete its yk correction plan should not have a material adverse impact on integra s business  results of operations  financial position and cash flow beyond the amounts discussed previously 
furthermore  integra does not currently expect that the effects of any yk non compliance on integra s information systems will have any material adverse impact on integra s business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that integra will not incur additional expenses or experience business disruption as a result of itsystem problems associated with the century change  including system and equipment problems of third parties with whom integra does business 
other matters at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  to offset future taxable income  if any  which expire through and  respectively 
at december   several of the company s subsidiaries had unused net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards arising from periods prior to the company s ownership 
the net operating loss carryforwards excluding telios of approximately million for federal income tax purposes expire between and the company s telios subsidiary has approximately million of net operating losses  which expire between and the amount of telios net operating loss that is available and the company s ability to utilize such loss is dependent on the determined value of telios at the date of acquisition 
the company s has valuation allowance of million against all deferred tax assets  including the net operating losses  due to the uncertainty of realization 
the timing and manner in which these net operating losses may be utilized in any year by the company are severely limited by the internal revenue code of  as amended  section and other provisions of the internal revenue code and its applicable regulations
