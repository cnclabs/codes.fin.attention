item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview ciena is a leader in the rapidly emerging optical networking equipment market 
the company offers a comprehensive portfolio of products for tele and data communications service providers worldwide 
ciena s customers include long distance carriers  competitive local exchange carriers  internet service providers and wholesale carriers 
ciena offers optical transport  intelligent switching and multi service delivery systems that enable service providers to provision  manage and deliver high bandwidth services to their customers 
the company has pursued a strategy to develop and leverage the power of disruptive technologies to change the fundamental economics of building carrier class tele and data communications networks  providing its customers with a competitive advantage 
in conjunction with the agreements to acquire lightera and omnia  ciena announced its lightworks tm initiative  ciena s vision of how to change the fundamental economics of optical telecommunication service provider networks 
the eventual addition of lightera s and omnia s products to ciena s product suite will make it possible for ciena to offer telecommunications service providers a comprehensive next generation optical network architecture that dramatically reduces the total number of network elements  thereby lowering network costs 
on march  the company completed a merger with lightera in a transaction valued at approximately million 
lightera is a developer of carrier class optical core switches for fiberoptic communications networks 
under the terms of the agreement  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares and assumed outstanding stock options and warrants of lightera in exchange for approximately million shares of ciena common stock and million ciena shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants 
the transaction constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests under accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of lightera as though it had been a part of ciena 
on july  the company completed a merger with omnia in a transaction valued at approximately million 
omnia is a telecommunications equipment supplier which focuses on developing solutions to allow public telephone network operators to offer services cost effectively over integrated metropolitan fiberoptic access and transport networks 
under the terms of the agreement  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares and assumed the stock options of omnia in exchange for approximately million shares of ciena common stock and million ciena shares issuable upon exercise of stock options 
the transaction constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests under accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of omnia as though it had been a part of ciena 
on august   ciena announced that the omnia axr multi service transport platform had been integrated into the ciena lightworks architecture and that ciena had renamed the product the multiwave edgedirector tm ciena s multiwave edgedirector is a next generation multi service transport platform that combines the functions of traditional transport equipment with advanced data networking 
the multiwave edgedirector utilizes packet and cell technology to enable service providers to cost effectively deliver traditional voice and new high speed data services over a single optical network 
the initial release of the multiwave edgedirector became commercially available during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal both the multiwave r metro tm  ciena s system designed for use in metropolitan ring applications  and the multiwave corestream tm  ciena s next generation long distance optical transport system capable of up to channels of gb s  became available for commercial shipments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  gb s transmission capability of up to channel configuration for its multiwave corestream system became commercially available 
ciena intends to continue the development of the multiwave coredirector tm product 
multiwave coredirector is believed to be the world s first intelligent optical core 
the multiwave coredirector allows carriers to deliver a full range of transport services  without costly sonet sdh multiplexers or inflexible wavelength only devices 
we expect that field deployable units of the multiwave coredirector will be available at the end of the first calendar quarter see risk factors 
in november  the company announced it was pursuing enhancements to its multiwave corestream product that enable the system to offer the optimal combination of ultra long distance transport functionality and  channel count to further lower network costs for service providers 
using forward error correction fec  nonlinearity management  and dispersion mapping technologies  plus embedded software intelligence  multiwave corestream will be able to support optical spans longer than  kilometers without additional optical to electrical signal regeneration 
the company expects to begin beta trails of the ultra long distance feature of this product in the first half of calendar see risk factors 
ciena recognizes product revenue in accordance with the shipping terms specified and where collection is probable 
for transactions where ciena has yet to obtain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied 
revenue for installation services is recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply contract combine product acceptance with installation  in which case revenues for installation services are recognized when the terms of acceptance are satisfied and installation is completed 
revenues from installation service fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each contract 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
for distributor sales where risks of ownership have not transferred  ciena recognizes revenue when the product is shipped through to the end user 
ciena increased the number of its revenue generating optical transport equipment customers from a total of fourteen during fiscal to twenty seven for fiscal ciena s gross margin percentage decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal while this gross margin pressure continues  ciena believes that its product and service quality  manufacturing experience  and proven track record of delivery will enable it to be successful while it concentrates on efforts to reduce product costs and maximize production efficiencies 
ciena s gross margin percentage improved each quarter of fiscal as a result of its product cost reductions and production efficiencies 
gross margin percentage improved from in the fourth quarter fiscal to in the fourth quarter fiscal ciena intends to preserve and enhance its market leadership and eventually build on its installed base with new and additional products 
pursuit of these strategies  in conjunction with increased investments in research and development  selling  marketing  and customer service activities  will likely continue to limit ciena s operating profitability during the first six months of fiscal ciena intends to continue to pursue new or complementary technologies either through ongoing internal development or by acquisition in order to further broaden ciena s product line 
as of october  the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  persons  which was an increase of persons over the approximate  employed on october  results of operations fiscal years ended  and revenue 
the company recognized million  million and million in revenue for the fiscal years ended october   and  respectively 
the approximate million or decrease in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was largely the result of reduced selling prices 
the approximate million or increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in product shipments 
ciena recognized revenues from a total of twenty seven  fourteen  and five optical equipment customers during fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal year sprint  mciworldcom  and gts network ltd 
formerly hermes europe railtel each accounted for at least or more of ciena s revenue and all three combined accounted for of ciena s fiscal revenue 
this compares to fiscal in which sprint was the only customer and in total accounted for of ciena s fiscal revenue and fiscal where both mciworldcom and sprint were customers and combined accounted for of ciena s fiscal revenue 
revenue derived from foreign sales accounted for approximately   and of the company s revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal ciena s optical network equipment revenues were derived from sales of the multiwave sentry  multiwave sentry  multiwave  multiwave metro  multiwave firefly  multiwave edgedirector and multiwave corestream systems 
during fiscal the company recognized revenues from sales of multiwave sentry  multiwave  multiwave firefly  and multiwave sentry systems 
for fiscal year all of the company s optical network equipment revenues were derived from the multiwave product 
the amount of revenue recognized from multiwave sentry and multiwave sales declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal and also declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline in multiwave sentry sales in fiscal was offset by the introduction of new revenues from the multiwave corestream  multiwave edgedirector and multiwave metro products in fiscal and in fiscal the decline was offset by revenue recognized from sales of multiwave firefly  and multiwave sentry systems 
fiscal revenues from multiwave sentry and multiwave firefly were comparable to the revenues recognized for these products in fiscal revenues derived from engineering  furnishing and installation services as a percentage of total revenue were  and for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
based on overall new bid activity  as well as expected network deployment plans of existing customers  the company believes revenue growth in fiscal over fiscal is possible  but will be highly dependent on winning new bids from new and existing customers for shipments of the existing products as well as for the multiwave coredirector and multiwave edgedirector systems 
ciena expects that field deployable units of the multiwave coredirector will be available at the end of the first calendar quarter ciena also expects the percentage of fiscal revenue derived from foreign sales to be comparable to the levels obtained during fiscal competition of new bids is intense  and there is no assurance the company will be successful in winning enough new bids and new customers to achieve year over year sequential growth 
see risk factors 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing and engineering  furnishing and installation operations 
gross profit was million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
gross margin was   and for fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was largely attributable to lower selling prices 
ciena s gross margins may be affected by a number of factors  including continued competitive market pricing  lower manufacturing volumes and efficiencies and fluctuations in component costs 
during fiscal  ciena expects to face continued pressure on gross margins  primarily as a result of substantial price discounting by competitors seeking to acquire market share 
ciena intends to counter this pressure with the addition of new products and continued product cost reduction and production efficiency programs 
see risk factors 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to in research and development expenses related to increased staffing levels  purchases of materials used in development of new or enhanced product prototypes  and outside consulting services in support of certain developments and design efforts 
during fiscal   and research and development expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
ciena expects that its research and development expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal to support the continued development of the various optical networking products  the exploration of new or complementary technologies  and the pursuit of various cost reduction strategies 
ciena has expensed research and development costs as incurred 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to in selling and marketing expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels in the areas of sales  technical assistance and field support  and increases in commissions earned  trade show participation and promotional costs 
during fiscal   and selling and marketing expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company anticipates that its selling and marketing expenses may increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as additional personnel are hired and additional offices are opened to allow the company to pursue new customers and market opportunities 
the company also expects the portion of selling and marketing expenses attributable to technical assistance and field support  specifically in europe and asia  will increase as the company s installed base of operational multiwave systems increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the approximate million or increase from fiscal year to and the approximate million or increase from fiscal to in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased staffing levels and outside consulting services 
during fiscal  and  general and administrative expenses were   and of revenue  respectively 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and perhaps as a percentage of revenue during fiscal as a result of the expansion of the company s administrative staff required to support its expanding operations 
purchased research and development 
purchased research and development costs were million for the fiscal year these costs were for the purchase of technology and related assets associated with the acquisition of terabit during the second quarter of fiscal pirelli litigation 
the pirelli litigation costs of million in fiscal were attributable to a million payment made to pirelli during the third quarter of and to additional other legal and related costs incurred in connection with the settlement of this litigation 
the pirelli litigation expense in fiscal was primarily the result of a million charge for actual and estimated legal and related costs associated with the litigation 
merger related costs 
the merger costs for fiscal of approximately million were costs related to ciena s acquisition of omnia and lightera 
these costs include an million non cash charge for the acceleration of warrants based upon ciena s common stock price on june  and million for fees  legal and accounting services and other costs 
the warrants were issued to one of omnia s customers and became exercisable upon the consummation of the merger between ciena and omnia 
the merger related costs for fiscal were costs related to the contemplated merger between ciena and tellabs 
these costs include approximately million in securities and exchange commission filing fees and approximately million in legal  accounting  and other related expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  consists of interest income earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities  net of interest expense associated with the company s debt obligations 
other income expense  net  was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the year to year increase in other income expense  net  was primarily the result of the investment of the net proceeds of the company s stock offerings and net earnings 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company s benefit for income taxes was million or of pre tax losses for fiscal and provision was million and million or and of pre tax earnings for fiscal and  respectively 
the benefit for fiscal was less than the expected statutory benefit of due to non deductible merger costs 
the increase in the tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of charges for purchased research and development expenses recorded in fiscal and an adjustment to the estimated prior year state income tax liability associated with alta operations 
purchased research and development charges are not deductible for tax purposes 
exclusive of the effect of these charges  the company s provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in fiscal quarterly results of operations the tables below set forth the operating results and percentage of revenue represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in the opinion of the company reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

the company s detailed discussion of risk factors addresses the many factors that have caused such variation in the past  and may cause similar variations in the future 
see risk factors 
in addition to those factors  in fiscal  the distraction attendant to the aborted tellabs merger had a significant  though difficult to quantify impact on ciena s operations in the third and fourth quarter 
but apart from the distraction factor  ciena believes the single most significant trend affecting ciena s financial performance is the material effect of very aggressive price discounting by competitors seeking to acquire market share in the market for high capacity solutions 
ciena chose in the face of this pressure to continue to build market share in fiscal at the cost of declining margins 
ciena s gross margin percentage improved each quarter of fiscal as a result of its product cost reductions and production efficiencies 
gross margin percentage improved from in the fourth quarter fiscal to in the fourth quarter fiscal while this gross margin pressure continues  ciena believes that its product and service quality  manufacturing experience  and proven track record of delivery will enable it to be successful while it concentrates on efforts to reduce product costs and maximize production efficiencies 
the company intends to continue this strategy in order to preserve and enhance its market leadership and eventually build on its installed base with new and additional products 
pursuit of this strategy  in conjunction with increased investments in selling  marketing  and customer service activities  will likely continue to limit the company s operating profitability over at least the first half of fiscal see risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources ciena completed its initial public offering of common stock in february and realized net proceeds of approximately million with an additional million received from the exercise of certain outstanding warrants 
in july  ciena completed a public offering of common stock and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
during fiscal   and ciena also realized approximately million  million and million in tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and certain stock warrants  respectively 
also during fiscal and fiscal ciena received approximately million and million  respectively  from issuance of stock associated with the initial capitalization of omnia 
during fiscal ciena received approximately million from the issuance of stock associated with the initial capitalization of lightera 
as of october   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in corporate debt securities and us government obligations  with contractual maturities of six months or less 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss adjusted for the non cash charges of depreciation amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence and warranty  a decrease in prepaid income taxes  increases in accounts payable  and accrued expenses  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash provided by operations in fiscal and was principally attributable to net income adjusted for the non cash charges of depreciation  amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence and warranty  increases in accounts payable  and accrued expenses  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
included in investment activities were additions to capital equipment and leasehold improvements in fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively 
the capital equipment expenditures were primarily for test  manufacturing and computer equipment 
the company expects additional combined capital equipment and leasehold improvement expenditures of approximately million to be made during fiscal to support selling and marketing  manufacturing and product development activities and the construction of leasehold improvements for its facilities the company believes that its existing cash balance and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for at least the next to months 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending october  the company believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
year readiness many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year  accordingly  affected hardware and software will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
ciena s operations make use of a variety of computer equipment and software 
if the computer equipment and software used in the operation of ciena and its products do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on ciena s operations 
ciena has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of work required  if any  to make its systems  products and infrastructure year compliant 
based on internal testing performed to date and completed by ciena  ciena currently believes and warrants to its customers that its products are year compliant 
however  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving interaction of ciena s products with third party products  ciena may experience warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
the impact of customer claims  if broader than anticipated  could have a material adverse impact on ciena s results of operations or financial condition 
ciena has concluded a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of both information technology it or software systems and non it systems used to run its systems 
non it systems typically include embedded technology such as microcontrollers 
examples of ciena s non it systems include certain equipment used for production  research  testing and measurement processes and calibration 
ciena has completed the process of upgrading or replacing those identified non compliant systems 
for the year non compliance systems identified  the cost of remediation was not material to ciena s financial condition or operating results 
however  if significant new noncompliance issues are identified  ciena s results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
ciena changed its main financial  manufacturing and information system to a company wide year compliant enterprise resource planning erp computer based system during the fourth quarter of fiscal ciena estimates that it has spent approximately million on its erp implementation 
during fiscal  ciena spent approximately  to address identified year issues 
ciena used cash from operations for year remediation and replacement costs 
approximately less than of the information technology budget was used for remediation 
no other information technology projects have been deferred due to the year efforts 
ciena has employed an independent verification consultant to validate ciena s processes in order to assure the reliability of ciena s risk estimates 
the consultant s findings identify ciena s processes as sufficient and our risk of negative impact as low 
ciena has contacted its critical suppliers to determine whether a supplier s operations  products and services are year compliant 
to date  ciena s optical suppliers have represented that their products are year compliant or have represented that they are in the process of becoming fully compliant by december  if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they provide to ciena  this could have a material adverse impact on ciena s operations and financial results 
initial contingency plans have been developed in case ciena or its key suppliers will not be year compliant  and such noncompliance is expected to have a material adverse impact on ciena s operations 
the risks to ciena resulting from the failure of third parties in the public and private sector to attain year readiness are generally similar to those faced by other firms in ciena s industry or other business enterprises generally 
the following are representative of the types of risks that could result in the event of one or more major failures of ciena s information systems  factories or facilities to be year ready  or similar major failures by one or more major third party suppliers to ciena information systems could include interruptions or disruptions of business and transaction processing such as customer billing  payroll  accounts payable and other operating and information processes  until systems can be remedied or replaced  factories and facilities could include interruptions or disruptions of manufacturing processes and facilities with delays in delivery of products  until non compliant conditions or components can be remedied or replaced  and major suppliers to ciena could include interruptions or disruptions of the supply of raw materials  supplies and year ready components which could cause interruptions or disruptions of manufacturing and delays in delivery of products  until the third party supplier remedied the problem or contingency measures were implemented 
risks of major failures of ciena s principal products could include adverse functional impacts experienced by customers  the costs and resources for ciena to remedy problems or replace products where ciena is obligated or undertakes to take such action  and delays in delivery of new products 
risk factors our results can be unpredictable our near term results may be break even or may involve losses 
in general  sequential revenue and operating results over the next months are likely to fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to factors including timing and size of orders from customers the introduction of new products satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria manufacturing and shipment delays and deferrals our products require a relatively large investment and our target customers are highly demanding and technically sophisticated 
there are only a small number of customers in each geographic market and each customer has unique needs 
as a result  the sales cycles for our products are long often more than a year between our initial introduction to the customer and their commitment to purchase 
we budget expense levels on our expectations of long term future revenue 
these levels reflect our substantial investment in financial  engineering  manufacturing and logistics support resources we think we may need for large potential customers  even though we do not know the volume  duration or timing of any purchases from them 
as a result  we may continue to experience increased inventory levels  operating expenses and general overhead 
additionally  our core switching division and access systems division have ongoing development and operating expenses but are not expected to contribute materially to revenues until calendar changes in technology or the delays in the deployment of new products could hurt our near term prospects the market for optical networking equipment is changing at a rapid pace 
the accelerated pace of deregulation in the telecommunications industry likely will intensify the competition for improved technology 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products will depend upon our ability to successfully anticipate changes in technology  industry standards and customer requirements 
if we fail to deploy new and improved products in a timely manner  our competitive position and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
the complexity of the technology involved with several of our new products including the multiwave coredirector and the multiwave corestream products using gb s transmission capability or ultra long distance transport functionality could result in unanticipated delays in development and manufacturing 
in addition  the complexity of technology associated with support equipment for these products could result in unanticipated delays in the deployment of these products 
these delays could adversely affect our competitive and financial condition 
the introduction of new products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products uncompetitive from a pricing standpoint  obsolete or unmarketable 
any of these outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the certification process for new telecommunications equipment used in rboc networks  which is a process traditionally conducted by telcordia technologies  has in the past resulted in and may continue to result in unanticipated delays which may affect the deployment of our products for the rboc market 
any delays in component availability could result in delays in deployment of these products and in recognizing revenues 
these delays could adversely affect our customer relationships 
we face intense competition which could hurt our sales and profitability the market for optical networking equipment is extremely competitive 
competition in the optical networking market is broadly based on varying combinations of price  manufacturing capability  comprehensiveness of the system solution meeting immediate network needs and foreseeable scalability requirements 
a small number of very large companies have historically dominated the telecommunications equipment industry including lucent  alcatel  nortel  nec  pirelli  siemens  ericsson  fujitsu  and hitachi 
these companies have substantial financial  marketing  manufacturing and intellectual property resources 
in addition  these companies have substantially greater resources to develop or acquire new technologies 
we sell systems which compete directly with product offerings of these companies and in some cases displace their legacy equipment 
as such  we represent a specific threat to these companies 
the continued expansion of our product offerings with products such as the multiwave coredirector and multiwave edgedirector likely will increase this perceived threat 
we expect continued aggressive tactics from many of these competitors  including substantial price discounting early announcements of competing products one stop shopping appeals customer financing assistance intellectual property disputes these tactics can be particularly effective in a highly concentrated customer base such as ours 
our customers are under increasing competitive pressure to deliver their services at the lowest possible cost 
this pressure may result in pricing for optical networking systems becoming a more important factor in customer decisions  which may favor larger competitors that can spread the effect of price discounts in their optical networking product lines across an array of products and services and across a customer base which is larger than ours 
our inability to compete successfully against our competitors would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
several of our customers have indicated that they intend to establish a second vendor for optical transport products 
we do not know when or if these customers will select a second vendor or what impact the selection might have on purchases from us 
these customers could reduce their purchases from us  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us 
new competitors may also emerge to compete with our existing products as well as our future products 
there has been an increase in funding of new companies intending to develop new products for the optical networking market 
these companies have time to market advantages due to the narrow and exclusive focus of their efforts 
in particular  a number of companies  including several start ups  have announced products that compete with our multiwave corestream  multiwave metro  multiwave coredirector and multiwave edgedirector products 
we may not be able to successfully complete development and achieve commercial acceptance of new products the multiwave coredirector is in the customer trials phase and has not matured into commercially manufacturable units suitable for field deployment 
we expect that field deployable units of the multiwave coredirector will be available in the end of the first calendar quarter the multiwave corestream product with ultra long distance transport functionality is in the laboratory testing phase and has not matured into commercially manufacturable units suitable for field deployment 
we expect that the multiwave corestream product with ultra long distance transport functionality will be available for customer trials in the first half of calendar the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials to commercial acceptance involves a number of steps  including successful completion of product development the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  including application specific integrated circuits asic s which are not yet finalized validation of manufacturing methods extensive quality assurance and reliability testing  and staffing of testing infrastructure software validation establishment of systems integration and burn in requirements  and identification and qualification of component suppliers each of these steps in turn presents serious risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could materially and adversely affect the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of the products 
specialized asic s and intensive software testing and validation  in particular  are key to the timely introduction of the multiwave coredirector  and schedule delays are common in the final software and validation phase  as well as in the manufacture of specialized asics 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other execution risks may delay or even prevent the introduction of these products 
if we do not develop these products in a timely manner  our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the markets for the multiwave coredirector and multiwave edgedirector products are relatively new 
commercial acceptance of these products also is not established and there is no assurance that the substantial sales and marketing efforts necessary to achieve commercial acceptance in traditionally long sales cycles will be successful 
if the markets for these products do not develop or the products are not accepted by the market  our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are in the laboratory testing phase for future releases of the multiwave edgedirector product 
these releases expand upon the limited functionality of the initial release of the multiwave edgedirector and address anticipated market requirement 
we can make no assurances about the market acceptance for the initial release of the multiwave edgedirector or our ability to introduce future releases of the multiwave edgedirector in a timely manner 
if market acceptance of the initial or future releases of the multiwave edgedirector is limited or we are unable to successfully develop future releases of the multiwave edgedirector  our competitive position and financial condition could be adversely affected 
smaller customers may increase fluctuation in our results as we continue to address smaller emerging carriers  timing and volume of purchasing from these carriers can also be more unpredictable due to factors such as their need to build a customer base  acquire rights of way and interconnections necessary to sell network service  and build out new capacity  all while working within capital budget constraints 
this increases the unpredictability of our financial results because even these carriers purchase our products in multi million dollar increments 
unanticipated changes in customer purchasing plans also create unpredictability in our results 
most of our anticipated revenue over the next several quarters is comprised of orders of less than million each from several customers  some of which involve extended payment terms or other financing assistance 
our ability to recognize revenue from financed sales to these carriers will be impacted by their financial condition 
further  we will need to evaluate the collectibility of receivables from these carriers if their financial condition deteriorates in the future 
additionally  purchasing delays or changes in the amount of purchases by any of these customers  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may experience delays from our suppliers and for some items we do not have substitute suppliers we depend on a small number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as equipment used to manufacture and test our products 
our highest capacity product currently being shipped  the multiwave corestream which currently is capable of up to channels at gb s or channels at gb s transmission speeds  includes several higher performance components for which reliable  high volume suppliers are particularly limited 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in receipt of components 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of them could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delayed deliveries of key components from these sources could have a material adverse effect on ciena s near term results of operations 
our success largely depends on our ability to retain key personnel our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel  particularly those skilled and experienced with optical communications equipment 
our key founders and employees  together with the key founders and employees of lightera and omnia have received a substantial number of ciena shares and vested options that can be sold at substantial gains 
in many cases  these individuals could become financially independent through these sales  before ciena s future products have matured into commercially deliverable products 
under the circumstances  we face a difficult and significant task of retaining and motivating these key personnel 
as ciena has grown and matured  competitors efforts to entice our employees to leave have intensified  particularly among competitive startups and other early stage companies seeking to replicate ciena s experience 
ciena and its employees are parties to agreements that limit the employee s ability to work for a competitor and to solicit ciena employees and customers following termination of employment 
we expect our competitors will respect these agreements and not interfere with them 
however  ciena has in the past been required and may in the future  be required to resort to legal actions to enforce these agreements 
we could incur substantial costs in enforcing these claims 
we can make no assurances that we will be successful in these suits  or that we will be able to retain all of our key contributors or attract new personnel to add to or replace them 
the loss of key personnel would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product performance problems could limit our sales prospects the production of new fiberoptic products and systems with high technology content involves occasional problems as the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
we are aware of instances domestically and internationally of delayed installation and activation of some of our products due to faulty components 
if significant reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  a number of material adverse effects could result  including manufacturing rework costs high service and warranty expense high levels of product returns delays in collecting accounts receivable reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there will be interruptions or delays in the activation of our products and the addition of channels  particularly because we do not control all aspects of the installation and activation activities 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we can not promptly resolve  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our prospects depend on demand which we cannot predict or control we may not anticipate changes in direction or magnitude of demand for bandwidth 
unanticipated reductions in bandwidth demand would adversely affect us 
our products enable high capacity transmission over long distance  and certain short haul portions  of optical communications networks 
our multiwave coredirector product is targeted to high capacity applications and our multiwave edgedirector product is targeted to providers of integrated fiberoptic access and transport networks 
customers  however  determine the quantity of bandwidth needed the timing of its deployment  and the equipment configurations and network architectures they want customer determinations are subject to abrupt change in response to their own competitive pressures  pressures to raise capital and financial performance expectations 
our stock price may exhibit volatility our common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past  and is likely to remain volatile in the future 
volatility can arise as a result of the activities of short sellers and risk arbitrageurs  and may have little relationship to our financial results or prospects 
volatility can also result from any divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts  and announcements we may make 
this occurred in we attempt to address this possible divergence through our public announcements and reports  however  the degree of specificity we can offer in these announcements  and the likelihood that any forward looking statements we make will prove correct in actual results  can and will vary 
this is due primarily to the uncertainties associated with our dependence on a small number of existing and potential customers the impact of changes in the customer mix the actions of competitors long and unpredictable sales cycles and customer purchasing programs the absence of unconditional minimum purchase commitments from any customer a lack of visibility into our customers deployment plans over the course of the capital equipment procurement year  and the lack of reliable data on which to anticipate core demand for high bandwidth transmission capacity and for demand for edge service delivery and optical switching products such as our multiwave coredirector 
divergence will likely occur from time to time in the future  with resulting stock price volatility  irrespective of our overall year to year performance or long term prospects 
as long as we continue to depend on relatively few customers  and particularly when a substantial majority of their purchases consist of newly introduced products like the multiwave corestream  multiwave edgedirector and multiwave metro  there is substantial risk of widely varying quarterly results 
legal proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business in august  shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our officers and directors 
these lawsuits  which were consolidated into one amended complaint  which was dismissed by the united states district court on july   with leave to amend 
on august  plaintiffs filed the second amended class action complaint 
we have filed and briefed a motion asking the court to dismiss the second amended complaint 
we believe the allegations in the complaint are without merit and intend to defend the case vigorously 
if  after discovery and trial  the case is decided adversely to ciena  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
some of our suppliers are also our competitors some of our component suppliers are both primary sources for components and major competitors in the market for system equipment 
for example  we buy certain components from lucent alcatel nortel nec  and siemens each of these companies offers optical communications systems and equipment which are competitive with our products 
also  lucent is the sole source of two components and is one of two suppliers of two others 
alcatel and nortel are suppliers of lasers used in our products and nec is a supplier of an important piece of testing equipment 
a decline in reliability or other adverse change in these supply relationships could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate debt securities and us government agency discount notes with an average maturity of less than six months 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically the company s primary exposures have been related to nondollar denominated operating expenses in canada  europe and asia where the company sells primarily in us dollars 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union began during the company s fiscal year the foreign currency exposure resulting from the introduction of the euro has been immaterial to the operating results of the company 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
as of october  the assets and liabilities of the company related to non dollar denominated currencies was not material 
therefore an increase or decrease of percent in the foreign exchange rate would not have a material impact on the company s financial position
