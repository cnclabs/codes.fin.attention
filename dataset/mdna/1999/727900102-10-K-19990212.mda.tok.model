the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include but are not limited to the following the company sells relatively expensive capital equipment  and in any given quarter or financial period  any one customer or any individual shipment may represent a significant portion of revenue in that period 
therefore  a delay or cancellation of that shipment could cause the company to experience a revenue or earnings shortfall for a given financial period 
the company relies on distributors and representatives  which complement its direct sales and service staff  to sell and service its products in various geographic locations

year the inability of computers  software  and other equipment that utilize microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a two digit year commonly is referred to as the year issue 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its hardware and software systems and all of the company s embedded systems contained in the company s buildings  plant  equipment  and other infrastructure to identify applications that could be affected by the year issue 
following this review  the company took corrective measures to resolve any problems associated with the year issue  and the costs associated with such corrective measures were not material 
all of the company s hardware and software systems and embedded systems have been tested internally and the company believes them to be year compliant 
however  there cannot be any guaranty that all of the company s systems are year compliant 
the company also has conducted a comprehensive review of the year readiness of the company s products  which includes the computers that form a part of the company s products and the software included with the versalock registered trademark series 
with respect to the computers that form a part of the company s products  each of these computers is substantially year compliant 
however  the functions performed by these computers are not affected by their ability to recognize and perform properly date sensitive functions 
as a result  the performance of the company s products is not affected by whether these computers are year compliant 
accordingly  the failure of these computers to be year compliant would not have a material affect on the company 
the company includes a software program with the versalock registered trademark series 
the company has tested this software and found that the software could be affected by the year issue 
however  the year problem associated with the software can be corrected by the user by changing the date manually on the computer 
the company is notifying its versalock registered trademark series customers of the manual method of correcting the year problem

the company has received responses from a majority of these suppliers that they are or will be year compliant  and the company will continue to seek responses from the rest of its suppliers 
based on the company s year analysis described above  the company is uncertain of its most reasonably likely worst case scenario if either the company s products  systems  customers  or suppliers are not year compliant 
in addition  the company has not established and does not intend to establish a contingency plan in case it is not year compliant
