liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased by  during to  this decrease is due to the excess of our operational losses  capital expenditure and net movements in working capital over the proceeds of private placements of shares  convertible debt and the exercise of employee share options for the year 
to date  we have realized only modest revenues from our operations 
we continue  as in the past  to depend upon raising equity funds from private placements 
our independent auditors report on our consolidated financial statements included in item states that 
senetek 
has suffered recurring losses from its operations and its ability to continue research activities to a stage where it has a product able to be commercialised is dependent upon securing additional sources of financing  which raises substantial doubt about 
senetek s 
ability to continue as a going concern 
in april  we issued  in aggregate principal amount of secured promissory notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually  and are due and payable in full in april the repayment of the notes is secured by all of the assets of senetek plc and its subsidiaries 
in exchange for the issuance of the notes  we received  in cash less expenses and refinancing of  of our previously outstanding debt 
we also issued warrants to purchase ordinary shares in connection with the issuance of the notes 
although we have received no commitment for the advance of any further funds  other lenders who advance up to an additional  may share in the collateral securing the notes described above on a pari passu basis with the existing noteholders 
our other most significant revenue commitments are our research agreements  consulting agreements  employment agreements and property leases 
in addition  capital expenditure amounted to  in in connection with the set up of supply chain capability for the manufacture of reliaject components in advance of the commercialization of the invicorp and adrenaject products 
in the event of the use of kinetin as a pharmaceutical  as opposed to a cosmetic product  we would have to commit considerable additional expenditure  and the speed at which this work can be undertaken will depend upon our financial resources 
we anticipate spending approximately million during on the development of our pharmaceutical products  including reliaject applications  and on our administrative and marketing structure operations 
although our management believes that we will generate revenues from the sale of our cosmetic product lines  monoclonal antibodies and the invicorp product to named patients  these will not be sufficient to address our projected short term financial requirements 
additionally  certain holders of a substantial number of warrants may exercise their right to convert their warrants into shares upon payment to us of the exercise price as the conversion dates approach 
our management is discussing the possibility of entering into licensing arrangements with several major pharmaceutical companies 
although these discussions may lead to a license agreement of a substantial nature in due course  we cannot assure that we will be successful in securing such an agreement 
government policy it is the opinion of our board of directors that there are no aspects of government policy which  as far as can be foreseen  are likely to have a material effect on the conduct of our business  except as generally described in part i  item  of this form k under the heading government regulation 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on the results of our operations to date 
year the problem the term year issue is used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year approaches 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from those in the s 
this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
our state of readiness we have instituted a year assessment and remediation project 
as a part of this project  we have completed an initial evaluation of our computer systems and significant software programs  including our network hardware and operating systems and accounting and business process software  as well as our non information technology systems 
in anticipation of potential year system problems  we have begun to replace our management information systems with a platform designed to be year compliant 
we expect to complete this process in the second quarter of we have retained a consulting firm to coordinate successful system implementation  including testing of year related problems 
we will commence testing for year compliance upon full implementation of our new system and will continue this testing throughout we presently believe that upon completion of successful system conversions  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for us 
however  although our new systems are designed to be year compliant  we cannot assure you that the systems contain all necessary data code changes 
if we do not complete our conversions in a timely fashion  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
as a part of our year project  we have assessed our products in connection with year issues 
our products do not contain any software  date sensitive fields or embedded microprocessors  therefore  we do not believe that our products will present year issues 
we are also in the process of contacting our vendors and other third parties on which we rely to obtain information about their year compliance 
we plan to complete these contacts by the end of the second quarter of based on our review of responses we have received to date  we do not expect this issue to have a material adverse effect on our business 
the costs to address our year issues in  we spent approximately  to address year issues  including the purchase of new software 
we expect that our assessment  remediation and contingency planning activities for its internal systems will be ongoing through we currently expect the total cost for these activities to be approximately  in this cost estimate does not include replacement of internal software and hardware in the normal course of business 
we do not believe that these costs will materially affect our liquidity or financial condition 
the costs of our year project and the date established for completion of year modifications are based on our management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these estimates  actual results could differ materially from those we currently anticipate 
the risks associated with our year issues our failure to resolve year issues by december  could result in system failures or miscalculation  causing disruptions in our operations and normal business activities 
in addition  the failure of our vendors or other third parties on whom we rely to remediate their year issues could result in disruptions in our ability to obtain parts and materials or other problems related to our daily operations 
since third party year compliance is not within our control  and since we have not completed the process of obtaining compliance information from vendors and others  we cannot assure that a vendor s or other third party s failure to achieve year compliance would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
contingency plan we are currently working on a contingency plan for all critical aspects of our year issues and expect to have completed such a plan by the third quarter of impact of recently issued accounting standards in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits  which revises employer s disclosures about pensions and other post retirement plans 
sfas is effective for the periods beginning after december  and requires comparative information for earlier years to be restated 
the standard currently does not apply to senetek 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as hedge  the object of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of i the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk  or ii the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  historically  we have not entered in to derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  variability in interest rate spread relationships ie  prime to libor spreads and exchange rate variability 
we manage these market risks using derivative financial instruments in accordance with established polices and procedures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we believe that fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows as we have limited risks related to interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations
