the company incurred a net loss of  or 
per share  compared with net income of  or 
per share for the prior fiscal year 
the principal reason for the loss was the charge incurred in the company s third quarter relating to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and inventories for three customers  two of which filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code near the end of that quarter as discussed below 
the company is reassessing its entire operations and intends to identify those costs and expenses that will be reduced or eliminated

in the last fiscal year  the company incurred legal expenses of approximately million in its lawsuit with capital vials  as discussed in item legal proceedings  above 
while discovery in the proceeding is substantially complete  the company expects to continue to incur legal expenses in connection with that matter

near the end of the third quarter of fiscal two of the company s customers filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and a third customer indicated that it was having extreme financial difficulty obtaining needed additional financing to pay amounts owed to the company 
accordingly  in the third quarter the company recorded a pre tax charge of million after tax  or 
per basic and diluted share relating to a provision for losses on accounts receivable balances and inventory on hand for these customers 
this pre tax charge is shown in the statements of income as an unusual item 
company management is actively involved in trying to recover these amounts owed 
the two customers that filed for bankruptcy protection are serviced by the company s facility in tucson  arizona 
also  one of these customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
given the uncertainty as to future sales volumes to these customers  as well as other factors impacting the operations of the company s tucson facility  the company is evaluating several alternatives for the company s operational structure at that location 
based on the company s preliminary analysis of the various alternatives  further charges relating to impairment of the facility s long lived assets are not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
should the alternatives not produce the results currently anticipated  a future impairment charge may be necessary

the decrease in the automotive market was also impacted by one customer who moved their tools into their own molding facility 
however  shortly thereafter the work was returned to the company 
cost of sales represented of sales in fiscal compared to in the lower cost of sales percentage in was principally attributed to mold manufacturing cost reductions in addition to the company s continued efforts in molded part manufacturing cost reductions as a result of manufacturing efficiency improvement initiatives

sfas no 
established standards for the way in which publicly held companies report financial and descriptive information about their operating segments in financial statements for both interim and annual periods  and requires additional disclosures with respect to products and services  geographic areas of operation and major customers

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  an exposure draft has been proposed by the fasb extending the effective date to all fiscal quarters for all fiscal years beginning after june  historically  the company has not entered into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes 
accordingly  the company does not expect adoption of the new standard to affect its financial statements 
statement of position sop reporting on the costs of start up activities  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   provides guidance on financial reporting of costs of start up activities 
the company expenses all start up costs when incurred  consistent with the sop and  accordingly  this standard will not affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
other matters during fiscal  the company s program to address the year date recognition problem continued to make progress toward its goal to ensure the millennium event does not have a material adverse effect on its business operations 
the company has substantially completed the process of identifying  evaluating and implementing changes to computer programs and equipment necessary to address the year issue 
this issue involves the ability of computer systems and equipment that have time sensitive programs to properly recognize the year the inability to do so could result in major failures or miscalculations 
these plans provide for systems to be year compliant by the end of costs to date consisting of internal costs  which are not incremental in nature  have not been tracked by the company 
future costs to be incurred to complete yk compliance and testing procedures  primarily internal costs related to direct company personnel  are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
during fiscal year  the company developed a plan to determine the year compliance status of its key suppliers and customers 
the plan involves soliciting information from suppliers and customers through use of surveys  and follow up discussions and testing where needed 
the company has sent out surveys to all of its key suppliers and certain key customers and received back a majority of these surveys 
while the company cannot guarantee year compliance by its key suppliers and customers  and in many cases will be relying on statements from outside vendors without independent verification  preliminary surveys indicate that key suppliers and customers are aware of this issue and are working on a solution to achieve compliance before the year the company is also in the process of developing a contingency plan to deal with those key suppliers and customers who may not be year compliant prior to the year if certain key suppliers or customers were not year compliant and the company did not have a contingency plan in place related to those key suppliers or customers because the company was unaware of the noncompliance  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be significantly and negatively impacted 
however  at this time the company is not aware  based on information received from these customers and suppliers  of any key suppliers or customers who will not be year compliant by the year this annual report contains statements which  to the extent they are not historical facts  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are identified by the use of forward looking words such as anticipates  intends  expects  plans  believes  estimates or similar words 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks  and uncertainties  and the statements looking forward beyond are subject to greater uncertainty because of the increased likelihood of changes in underlying factors and assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements 
by making forward looking statements  the company assumes no obligation to update them to reflect new  or unanticipated events or circumstances
