item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
general ameripath operates in a single operating segment as the largest integrated physician group practice focused on medical providers of anatomic pathology diagnostic services 
the company operates as a large group practice of pathologists in both hospital inpatient laboratories and outpatient independent laboratories 
the pathologists provide diagnostic anatomic pathology and related histologic services with particular emphasis on dermatopathology study of diseases of the skin  hematopathology study of diseases of the blood  and cytopathology study of abnormalities of the cells  as well as surgical pathology diagnostic services in connection with surgical procedures 
outpatient pathology services are performed in licensed freestanding  independent pathology laboratories owned and operated by the company 
services performed are billed to patients  medicare  medicaid  other third party payors  national clinical laboratories and attending physicians primarily on a fee for service basis  which cover both the professional and technical components of such services 
inpatient pathology services are performed under exclusive contractual arrangements with hospitals 
net revenue for inpatient pathology services is dependent in large part on the level of inpatient admissions and outpatient surgeries performed at the hospitals 
such arrangements typically provide that a pathologist will provide diagnostic pathology services for the hospital s staff physicians and serve as the medical director of the hospital s laboratory with responsibility for the clinical laboratory and histology departments  as well as the hospital s blood banking and microbiology services 
achieving growth through acquisitions is one of the company s principal business strategies 
the following table depicts the company s growth through acquisition activity year ended december  number of practices acquired pathologists  added outpatient laboratories  added hospital contracts  added at december   the company operated in ten states  with pathologists providing services in hospitals and outpatient laboratories 
between january and march   the company acquired one additional pathology physician practice in texas  adding pathologists 
the company focuses on developing regional networks  such as in the state of florida  and expanding the practices through its internal marketing efforts 
the company plans to pursue additional acquisitions inpatient and outpatient pathology practices in the foreseeable future  which represents a significant portion of its growth strategy as well as starting its own outpatient laboratories in target market areas and providing esoteric testing services 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net revenue billings net of contractual and other allowances 
percentage of net revenue year ended december  net revenue operating costs cost of services selling  general and administrative expense provision for doubtful accounts amortization expense loss on cessation of clinical lab operations total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest expense nonrecurring charge other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the company completed the acquisition of fifteen practices in  five practices in  and eleven practices in  the results of which are included in the company s operating results from the date of acquisition 
changes in operations between years were primarily due to these acquisitions 
net revenues the company derives its net revenue from the net revenue of the practices it owns or manages 
the majority of services furnished by the company s pathologists are diagnostic anatomic pathology services 
medicare reimbursement for these services represented approximately and of the company s cash collections in and  respectively 
the company typically bills government programs principally medicare and medicaid  indemnity insurance companies  managed care organizations  national clinical laboratories  physicians and patients 
net revenue differs from amounts billed for services due to bullet medicare and medicaid reimbursements at annually established rates  bullet payments from managed care organizations at discounted fee for service rates  bullet negotiated reimbursement rates with other third party payors  bullet rates negotiated under sub contracts with national clinical laboratories for the provision of anatomic pathology services  and bullet discounts and other allowances  principally from private pay accounts 
in recent years  there has been a shift away from traditional indemnity insurance plans to managed care as employers and other payors move their participants into lower cost plans 
the company benefits more from patients covered by medicare and traditional indemnity insurance than managed care organizations and national clinical laboratories  which contract directly under capitated agreements with managed care organizations to provide clinical as well as anatomic pathology services 
the company also contracts with national clinical laboratories and is attempting to increase the number of such contracts to increase test volume 
since the majority of the company s operating costs principally the compensation of physicians and non physician technical personnel are primarily fixed  increases in volume  whether from indemnity or non indemnity plans  enhance the company s profitability 
historically  net revenue from capitated contracts has represented an insignificant amount of total net revenue 
virtually all of the company s net revenue is derived from the practices charging for services on a fee for service basis 
accordingly  the company assumes the financial risk related to collection  including potential uncollectability of accounts  long collection cycles for accounts receivable and delays in reimbursement by third party payors  such as governmental programs  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
increases in write offs of doubtful accounts  delays in receiving payments or potential retroactive adjustments and penalties resulting from audits by payors may require the company to borrow funds to meet its current obligations or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to services billed on a fee for service basis  the hospital based pathologists have supervision and oversight responsibility for their roles as medical directors of the hospitals clinical  microbiology and blood banking operations 
for this role  the company bills non medicare patients according to a fee schedule for what is referred to as clinical component professional charges 
for medicare patients  the pathologist is typically paid a director s fee or part a fee by the hospital 
reimbursement of these clinical component billing charges and part a fees is coming under increased pressure for reduction from hospitals and third party payors  and in the future the company may sustain substantial decreases in these payments 
effective january   medicare began reimbursing all physician services  including anatomic pathology services  based on a methodology known as the resource based relative value system rbrvs  which was to be fully phased in by overall  anatomic pathology reimbursement rates declined during the fee schedule phase in period  despite an increase in payment rates for certain pathology services performed by the company 
the medicare rbrvs payment for each service is calculated by multiplying the total relative value units rvus established for the service by a geographic practice cost index gpci 
the sum of this value is multiplied by a statutory conversion factor 
the number of rvus assigned to each service is in turn calculated by adding three separate components work rvu intensity of work  practice expense rvu expense related to performing the service and malpractice rvu malpractice costs associated with the service 
in  the health care financing administration hcfa completed a five year review of the work value component and  as a result  revised the work value amount assigned to many physician services 
in addition  based on a default formula established by statute  the conversion factor for non surgical services dropped to 
as part of its five year review of the rbrvs system  hcfa recalculated all of the rbrvs weights 
these revisions generally resulted in a further reduction in medicare reimbursement 
hcfa also reduced the number of physician fee schedule payment localities from to  effective january  because of all these changes  there was an overall decrease in reimbursement rates for pathology services of approximately beginning january  with the bba  congress merged the three existing conversion factors into one for all types of services provided resulting in a single conversion factor for of in these changes effectively provided for an increase in reimbursement in in  hcfa published regulations that recalculated a key component of the rbrvs fee schedule 
this recalculation modified the practice overhead expense rvus to reflect resource consumption  rather than the historical charge data used to establish the original practice expense the implementation of resource based practice expense rvus will begin in  and will be phased in over the period also  in the physician fee schedule conversion factor was reduced by from in to for  because of a uniform budget neutrality adjustment which provides that the relative value units of the medicare physician fee schedule cannot cause expenditures to increase or decrease by more than million from the amount of expenditures that would have been made if such adjustments had not been made 
this requirement was implemented through a reduction in the conversion factor 
the conversion factor is also affected by the elimination of the separate budget neutrality adjustment to the work relative value units and the adjustments made to the practice expense and malpractice relative value units to ensure that percentages of fee schedule allowed charges for work  practice expense and malpractice premiums equal the new percentages that those categories represent in the revised medicare economic index mei weights 
the mei measures the weighted average annual price change for various inputs needed to produce physician s services 
hcfa also provided for a separate pap smear interpretation be made for all smears that require interpretation by a pathologist beginning january  the amount of this reimbursement will be approximately adjusted for the payor locality 
the actual impact of the forgoing changes on medicare pathology revenues will depend on the mix of pathology services furnished by the company s pathologists  which we estimate will result in a reduction in medicare reimbursement in in the range of from to 
in prior years  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of reduced medicare reimbursement rates for anatomic pathology services through the achievement of economies of scale and the introduction of alternative technologies that are not dependent upon reimbursement through the rbrvs system 
despite these offsets  the recent substantial modifications to the physician fee schedule  along with additional adjustments anticipated under medicare  will have a negative effect on the company s average unit reimbursement 
in addition  some of the other payors of the company could adjust their reimbursement based on the revised medicare fee schedule 
any reductions made by other payors could have a negative impact on the average unit reimbursement 
net revenue for increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and same practice net revenue for increased by million  or 
same practice inpatient net revenue was relatively flat  while the same practice outpatient net revenue increased approximately 
in addition  the medicare reimbursement increase  which was effective january   resulted in a increase in same practice net revenue 
reference to same practice means practices at which the company provided services for the entire period for which the amount is calculated and the entire prior comparable period and acquired hospital contracts and expanded ancillary testing services added to existing practices 
during  approximately million  or  of the company s net revenue was from contracts with national labs including smithkline  labcorp and quest 
in addition  approximately of the company s net revenue comes from columbia hospitals 
generally  these contracts have remaining terms of less than five years and contain renewal provisions 
some of the contracts contain clauses that allow for termination by either party with relatively short notice 
although the company  through its acquisitions  has had relationships with these hospitals and national labs for extended periods of time  the termination of one or more of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
net revenue for increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and same practice revenue decreased  which was due to a increase in outpatient volume  offset by a decrease in medicare reimbursement for surgical biopsies discussed above  which became effective on january  the percent of the company s net revenue from outpatient and inpatient pathology services is presented below 
the type and mix of business of the company s practices  inpatient or outpatient  which changes as a result of new acquisitions  and may affect the changes in the company s operating costs  specifically the provision for doubtful accounts  as noted in the sections that follow 
year ended december  revenue type inpatient outpatient cost of services cost of services consists principally of the compensation and fringe benefits of pathologists  licensed technicians and support personnel  laboratory supplies  shipping and distribution costs and facility costs 
cost of services for increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and  and million was in same practice costs 
cost of services  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased from in to in due in part to cost and operational efficiencies and the medicare price increase which went into effect january  same practice cost of services increased million from million in to million in cost of services for increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and million was due to the acquisitions the company completed during  offset by a  decrease in same practice costs 
cost of services  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased from in  to in  due primarily to the cost and operational efficiencies implemented in same practice cost of services decreased  from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expense the cost of corporate support  sales and marketing  and billing and collections comprise the majority of what is classified as selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased from in to in  as the company imposed measures to control the growth in these costs and continued to spread these costs over a larger revenue base 
an objective of the company is to decrease these costs  as a percentage of net revenues 
however  in these costs as a percentage of net revenues may increase as the company completes its year remediation  starts up the center for advanced diagnostics and expands into new geographic areas such as the northeast 
selling  general and administrative expense for increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million  or  was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and the remaining increase was due to increased staffing levels in marketing  billing  human resources and accounting and costs incurred to expand the company s administrative support infrastructure and to upgrade information systems 
selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of net revenues  decreased from in to in  as the company began to control the growth in these costs and continued to spread these costs over a larger revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expense for increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million  or  was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and the remaining increase was due to increased staffing levels in marketing  billing  human resources and accounting and costs incurred to expand the company s administrative support infrastructure and complete the conversion to an upgraded billing system 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of net revenue  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in the percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisitions  principally the acquisition of inpatient hospital based practices  the company completed during and net revenue from inpatient services increased as a percentage of consolidated net revenue from in to in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue is higher for inpatient services than for outpatient services due primarily to a larger concentration of indigent and private pay patients  more difficulties gathering complete and accurate billing information  and longer billing and collection cycles for inpatient services 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of net revenue  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase in the percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during  which acquisitions increased the percentage of net revenue from services provided in hospitals 
amortization expense the company s acquisitions completed in  and resulted in significant increases in net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  which include hospital contracts  physician client lists and laboratory contracts acquired in the acquisitions were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of the company s total assets 
net identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are amortized over periods ranging from to years  with a weighted average of years as of december  the company amortizes goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years  with a weighted average of years as of december  there can be no assurance that the value of intangible assets will ever be realized by the company 
on an ongoing basis  the company makes an evaluation based on undiscounted cash flows to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying value of intangible assets may no longer be recoverable  in which case an additional charge to earnings may be necessary 
although at december  the net amortized balance of intangible assets was not considered to be impaired 
any future determination requiring the write off of a portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
amortization expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to the amortization of goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets from the acquisitions the company completed during and a full year of amortization from the acquisitions the company completed during amortization expense is expected to increase on an annual basis as a result of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill arising from acquisitions  and any contingent payments required to be made pursuant to the contingent notes issued in connection therewith 
amortization expense  as a percentage of net revenues  was in and amortization expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to the amortization of goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets from the acquisitions the company completed during and a full year of amortization from the acquisitions the company completed during amortization expense  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in to in nonrecurring charge during the year ended december   the company wrote off certain deferred offering costs aggregating million  primarily consisting of professional fees and printing costs related to a registration statement relating to an intended initial public offering of shares of common stock filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission that was withdrawn in may interest expense and other expense  net interest expense decreased by  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due in part to a reduction in the average indebtedness outstanding 
in average indebtedness outstanding was million  compared to average indebtedness of million outstanding in in addition  the effective interest rate declined from to due to the reduction in the prime and libor borrowing rates 
interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions the company completed during and the average indebtedness outstanding in was million  as compared to average indebtedness of million outstanding in income tax rate the effective income tax rate was approximately for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate is higher than the company s statutory rates primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill amortization related to the company s acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million  an increase of million from the working capital of million at december  the increase in working capital was due to increases in net accounts receivable of million  current deferred tax assets of million  prepaid taxes of million and other current assets of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the majority of these changes resulted from the acquisitions the company completed during the company manages its cash balances against amounts available under its revolving credit facility 
cash balances  for the most part  are managed on a zero balance basis and all available cash flows are used to reduce outstanding debt in order to minimize interest cost 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operations was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility were used i for capital expenditures aggregating million  ii to fund the million cash portion of the acquisitions the company completed during  iii to make additional payments of million in connection with the company s acquisition activities  including contingent note payments of million  and iv to make million in principal payments on long term debt 
during october  the company completed an initial public offering and issued  shares of common stock at per share resulting in proceeds  net of underwriter commissions and offering costs  of approximately million 
the company used the proceeds from the offering to repay million of outstanding principal and interest on junior notes and senior notes  million of accrued dividends on the convertible preferred stock  and million of indebtedness outstanding under the company s credit facility 
during  the company acquired anatomic pathology practices 
total consideration in connection with these acquisitions included cash of million and approximately million shares of common stock 
generally  the shares of common stock are restricted as to transfer  which restrictions lapse over three to five years  based solely on the passage of time 
subsequent to december   the company acquired one additional practice 
this acquisition was made  in part  with million of cash 
in addition  for the and acquisitions  the company issued additional purchase price consideration in the form of contingent notes 
at december   the company had million available under its credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by bankboston  na  as agent 
the amended facility provides for borrowings of up to million in the form of a revolving loan that may be used for working capital purposes in an amount limited to of the company s net accounts receivable  as reflected on the company s quarterly consolidated balance sheet and to fund acquisitions to the extent not otherwise used for working capital purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving loan with an annual effective interest rate of 
in october  the company entered into two  two year  interest rate swap transactions which involves the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the differential to be paid or received is accrued and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreements are with notional amounts of million and million 
under the and million agreements  the company receives interest on the notional amounts if the day libor exceeds and  respectively  and pays interest on the notional amounts if the day libor is less than the foregoing rates 
these derivative financial instruments are being used by the company to reduce interest rate volatility and associated risks arising from the floating rate structure of its credit facility and is not held or issued for trading purposes 
at december   the company believes that it is in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the company s acquisitions  the company agreed to pay a minimum purchase price and to pay additional purchase price consideration to the sellers of the practices in proportion to their respective ownership interest in each practice 
the additional payments are generally contingent upon the achievement of stipulated levels of operating earnings as defined by each of the practices over periods of three to five years from the date of the acquisition as set forth in the respective agreements  and are not contingent on the continued employment of the sellers of the practices 
in certain cases  the payments are contingent upon other factors such as the retention of certain hospital contracts for periods ranging from three to five years 
the amount of the payments cannot be determined until the achievement of the operating earnings levels or other factors during the terms of the respective agreements 
if the maximum specified levels of operating earnings for each practice are achieved  the company would make aggregate maximum payments  including principal and interest  of approximately million over the next three to five years 
at the mid point level  the aggregate principal and interest would be approximately million over the next three to five years 
a lesser amount or no payments at all would be made if the maximum levels of operating earnings specified in each agreement are not met 
through december   the company made contingent note payments and interest aggregating million which amounts represent of the maximum amount available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  the company s capital expenditures have been primarily for laboratory equipment  management information systems and leasehold improvements 
total capital expenditures were  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  capital expenditures included approximately million related to information systems  million for laboratory equipment and  for leasehold improvements 
during  the company spent approximately  for equipment and leasehold improvements to the orlando facility to accommodate the expansion of its contract to provide anatomic pathology services to smithkline which commenced in may the contract provides that the company will maintain the appropriate personnel staffing levels to handle the estimated workload 
the company assesses and will continue to assess the capabilities of the various information systems acquired in connection with each of its acquisitions  and is in the process of replacing  upgrading and integrating certain of the systems into a single network 
planned capital expenditures for are estimated to be million to million  with priority being given to year compliance and enhancements in billing  financial and lab information systems 
historically  the company has funded its capital expenditures with cash flows from operations 
for the years ended december   and  capital expenditures were approximately  and of net revenue  respectively 
the company is consolidating and integrating its financial information  billing and collection systems  which may result in an increase in capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenue 
the company believes  however  that such information systems enhancements will result in cost savings that may enable the company to continue to fund its capital expenditures with cash flows from operations 
the company expects to continue to use the credit facility to fund acquisitions 
the company anticipates that funds generated by operations and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and contingent note obligations  and to finance capital expenditures  and acquisitions over the next months 
further  in the event payments under the contingent notes issued in connection with acquisitions become due  the company believes that the incremental cash generated from operations would exceed the cash required to satisfy the company s payment  if any  of the contingent obligations in any one year period 
such payments  if any  will result in a corresponding increase in goodwill and the related amount of amortization thereof in periods following the payment 
funds generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility may not be sufficient to implement the company s longer term growth strategy 
the company may be required to seek additional financing through additional increases in the credit facility  to negotiate credit facilities with other banks or institutions or to seek additional capital through private placements or public offerings of equity or debt securities 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to extend or increase the existing credit facility  secure additional bank borrowings or complete additional debt or equity financings on terms favorable to the company or at all 
year issues the year issue is a result of computer programs or chipsets being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar activities 
the company is continually working to resolve the potential risks and concerns of the year issue 
the company has made progress in assessing  remediating  testing and implementing systems to be year ready 
the company has a comprehensive working assessment for both information technology and non information technology systems covering the majority of its existing practices 
when acquiring new practices  the company will assess the year risk and compliance as part of the due diligence process 
the company has substantially completed the assessment phase for most of its practices 
the company classifies all systems into categories of importance mission critical  business critical and non critical 
the company plans to complete its remediation  validation and implementation of its multi phase plan by june  the company s year phases to correct most information technology and non information technology systems are as follows awareness the continuous process of promoting awareness of the year issue across the company  including communications to the management and board of directors 
assessment the assessment phase includes the physical inventory of all information technology and non information technology hardware  software and embedded systems  the determination of whether hardware and software are year ready or if remediation is required  the determine of risk tradeoffs and contingencies needed  and the determination of whether our business partners  vendors  and third party payors are year compliant 
remediation the installation of software or hardware upgrades  replacements or renovations to be year ready 
validation the generation of approved test plans  perform tests and produce results for year certification and signoff 
implementation implementation of the company s remediated systems prior to the company is also assessing the risks and contingencies for third party payors  strategic partners  vendors  contracted hospitals  large commercial payors eg medicare  blue cross blue shield and cigna and facility safety systems 
the company has initiated dialogue with its key vendors and customers  including hospitals and third party payors  to determine the extent of any exposure that the company may have with respect to failure on the part of such third parties to become year compliant 
the company is working directly with strategic partners and third parties to avoid business interruptions in the year there can be no assurance that the computer systems of such external parties upon which the company is dependent  including third party payors  will become compliant in a timely manner  or  that such lack of compliance will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems  results of operations or financial position 
the majority of the company s costs to correct the year issue stem from professional services and hardware and software replacements 
the cost of new hardware or software purchased in this regard is capitalized and all other costs associated with such remedial actions are expensed as incurred 
the total cost associated with the company s year project is estimated between million and million  which will be funded by cash flow generated by operations and the company s credit facility 
the company does not expect these costs to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position 
the company believes that the most likely worst risk scenario relating to the year could impact diagnosis reporting or bill generation causing strategic partners  payors and patients from receiving medical and billing information in a timely matter 
the worst case scenarios could result in such things as decreased cash flows  claims rejection and untimely diagnostic reporting 
the company has developed contingency plans ie identified alternate systems and processing capabilities for any internal company systems which are mission critical or business critical systems  if year compliance is not achieved 
the estimated year costs include the contingency plans and workarounds 
the worst case contingency scenarios for the company systems could be the replacement of entire laboratory information or billing systems that are unable to meet the company s criteria of year compliance 
the costs associated with the company s efforts to become year compliant and the date it expects to complete the required modifications are based on management s current estimates 
such estimates reflect numerous assumptions as to future events  including the continued availability of required resources  the year readiness of practices acquired in the future  the reliability of the compliance plans and actions of third parties and other factors 
there can be no assurance that the final costs of the year compliance project will not exceed the current estimates or that all systems  including those of planned acquisitions  will be compliant by the anticipated compliance date 
specific factors that might cause material differences in actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of qualified personnel and other required resources  the ability to identify and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
there can be no assurances that any failure in the company s systems or third parties to be year compliant will not have a material effect on the company
