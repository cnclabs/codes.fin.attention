pounds sold rose by from to and by from to these higher volumes were partially offset by lower selling prices  which decreased from to and from to the lower selling prices were caused by increased competition and lower pvc resin prices 
the increase in gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  from to is primarily due to a combination of strong demand and falling resin prices in pvc resin prices decreased due to an oversupply of resin caused by depressed asian markets

therefore  the company was unable to pass all of the raw material price increases on to its customers during the first half of the lower selling prices were due to pvc resin prices peaking earlier than usual in resin prices peaked in may  compared to the more traditional fall winter price descent in september of to maintain its market share  the company was required to lower its prices at the same rate that raw material prices declined

outlook 
the statements contained in this outlook are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by some of the statements made herein 
the company expects the demand for plastic pipe to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for plastic pipe of three percent or greater per year through the company has historically been able to  and expects in the future to be able to  grow at rates substantially in excess of the industry averages due to its emphasis on customer satisfaction  product quality and differentiation and innovative promotional programs 
the company s strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth initiatives in higher profit products and geographic regions 
the company s gross margin percentage is a sensitive function of pvc and pe raw material resin prices and capacity levels in the industry 
in a rising or stable resin market  margins and sales volume have historically been higher and conversely  in falling resin markets  sales volumes and margins have historically been lower 
gross margins also suffer when capacity increases outpace demand due to increased competition to utilize capacity 
the company believes that supply and demand in the plastic pipe industry is currently balanced 
due to the commodity nature of pvc and pe resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very difficult to predict gross margin percentages or assume that historical trends will continue 
the nols are available through  however  the majority expire by the amount of available nols actually used will be dependent on future profits 
the company does not expect to utilize all of its nols before they expire 
the foregoing statements contained in this outlook section and those specifically relating to the company s expectation of the plastic pipe and tubing market and the company s performance in relation to such growth  the company s ability to utilize nols in the future and its belief that it has the necessary resources for future success are all forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  raw material cost fluctuations  general economic conditions  competition  availability of working capital and weather conditions 
the company has received a commitment letter from fleet capital corporation fleet whereby fleet has agreed to act as agent and underwrite million of a million senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility will be used to finance the company s ongoing operations 
the million senior credit facility will consist of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan facility 
the term of the senior credit facility is expected to be three years and the interest rate is expected to be based on a variable rate prime rate or libor  at the company s option  plus a margin based on the company s interest coverage ratio

year yk compliance 
as with other organizations  the company s computer hardware and software were originally designed to recognize calendar years by their last two digits 
calculations performed using these truncated fields would not work properly with dates from the year and beyond 
the company has completed an assessment of its information systems programs and completed changes on the majority of these programs to make them yk compliant 
the remaining programs are expected to be corrected by the end of the first quarter of the company is currently assessing  with the assistance of its vendors  whether any yk problems exist in its office and production equipment 
this assessment project along with the remediation of any problems is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of in addition  the company has inquired of its major customers and suppliers as to their readiness to the yk issue to determine the extent to which the company is indirectly vulnerable to any third party yk issues 
many of the company s customers and suppliers have responded that they believe they are or will be yk compliant 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total cost associated with the modifications to be yk compliant are expected to be below  of which approximately  have been expensed as of december  the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of the company s third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material impact on the company s operations 
the company believes that the assessment and remediation steps it is taking will significantly reduce its exposure to the yk problem 
at this time  the company believes it has addressed all yk issues that may arise  therefore  no contingency plan has been developed 
if problems are detected during the company s in house testing  or if information is received from an outside source that they would be unable to be yk compliant  the company will then develop an appropriate contingency plan to address yk problems that may arise
