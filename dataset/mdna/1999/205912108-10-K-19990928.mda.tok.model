management believes that the adoption by european business of the euro will not have a material impact on the company s operations 
inflation did not have a material impact on the company s revenue or income from operations in fiscal  or income taxes the company recorded an million income tax benefit in fiscal  recognizing the availability of an income tax refund 
the income tax provision in fiscal of million was related to the company s sale of its retail business

the benefit from income taxes in fiscal was million  which related to the company s operating loss for the year 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income or by using a tax strategy currently available to the company 
on a quarterly basis  management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
this assessment could be impacted by a combination of continuing operating losses and a determination that the tax strategy is no longer sufficient to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets 
the foregoing statements regarding the realization of deferred tax assets are forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended

liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and cash equivalents were million  compared with cash and cash equivalents of million at june  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was principally due to the payment of taxes and other costs related to the sale of the company s retail business  fiscal and prior years restructuring related items  the company s stock repurchase program and other cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of the change made related to internal development costs 
during fiscal and prior years  certain internal development costs were capitalized and such costs were amortized 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was reduced by million of software amortization 
during fiscal year  the company did not capitalize  nor amortize software development costs

net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash related to investing activities for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june   was principally due to the proceeds received from the sale of the company s retail business during fiscal  offset by capitalized computer software costs

in fiscal  property and equipment purchases are expected to be comparable to fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decrease in cash related to financing activities was primarily due to the company s stock repurchase program and the repayment of debt agreements and capital leases during fiscal working capital as of june  was million  compared with million as of june  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the decline in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable from fiscal to fiscal the decline in accounts receivable is primarily the result of the sales of the retail business and french and german operations 
these amounts were offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to the payment of taxes and other accruals related to the retail business sale and payment of fourth quarter fiscal restructuring related items 
total assets were million at june   compared with total assets of million at june  the decrease in total assets was primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the fiscal year 
the company has a million credit agreement which matures on october  borrowings are secured by accounts receivable and the credit agreement contains covenants regarding among other things  earnings  leverage  net worth and payment of dividends 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company is not permitted to pay cash dividends on its common stock 
permitted borrowings available as of june  under this credit agreement were million  of which  was outstanding 
borrowings available at any time are based on the lower of million or a percentage of worldwide eligible accounts receivable and cash 
at june   the interest rate on borrowings denominated in japanese yen and swiss francs  which were used to hedge receivables in those currencies  varied between and 
separately  in august  the company s united kingdom subsidiary entered into a million loan agreement  which matures on may  the company had outstanding borrowings under this agreement of  at june   which are classified as a capital lease 
the interest rate was at june  in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock

the company believes that the combination of present cash balances and amounts available under credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the foregoing statement is a forward looking statement within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended

market sensitivity analysis the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency the company at various times denominates borrowings in foreign currencies and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures related to foreign currency transactions 
the company does not use any other types of derivatives to hedge such exposures nor does it speculate in foreign currency 
in general  the company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge against large selective transactions that present the most exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
at june  and june   the company had forward contracts of approximately million and million notional amounts  respectively  denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts outstanding at june  mature through october  and are intended to hedge various foreign currency commitments due from the company s distributors 
due to the short term nature of these financial instruments  the fair value of these contracts is not materially different than their notional amounts at june  and gains and losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposure 
the company conducts business in approximately foreign currencies  predominately british pounds and japanese yen 
a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from june  market rates would increase the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by an immaterial amount and a hypothetical percent depreciation of the us dollar from june  market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the company s forward contracts by an immaterial amount 
in either scenario  the gains or losses on the forward contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions 
interest rates the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid investments with maturities of ninety days or less 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents 
year the following discussion contains information regarding year readiness  and constitutes a year readiness as defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act of many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
programs that will operate in the year unaffected by the change in year from to are referred to herein as year compliant 
certain portions of the discussion set forth below contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  including  but not limited to  those relating to the year compliance of the company s products and systems  future costs to remediate year issues  the timetable in which such remediation is to occur  the alternatives available to the company to become fully year compliant  the company s mission critical requirements and the impact on the company of an inability of it or its key suppliers to become fully year compliant 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statement due to a number of uncertainties set forth below 
the company has tested and modified the most current versions of its products to be year compliant 
the company believes that all of its current client server and web architected products are year compliant including budgetplus  decision  decisionweb and fdc 
the company has released new versions of its principal mainframe and desktop products that it believes are year compliant 
the company has no plans to make earlier versions of its products year compliant and has made substantial efforts to contact customers informing them of this decision 
not all of the company s customers are running product versions that are year compliant 
the company has encouraged and will continue to encourage these customers to migrate to its current product versions 
some of these customers may not be willing to migrate to current product versions because of the cost and time required to do so  including the need to rewrite custom applications which are not year compliant 
for non compliant direct customers that have maintenance contracts  the company has proactively shipped them the latest version of its products to ensure their compliance  and is encouraging its distributors to do the same in indirect territories 
a significant portion of the company s maintenance revenue in fiscal was derived from customers running versions of the company s products which are not year compliant  however  customers paying maintenance are entitled to obtain year compliant versions of licensed products at no additional cost 
certain of the company s older product will not be made year complaint in any version 
the company has ceased providing further maintenance services for those products and has not renewed maintenance contracts with customers using these products for periods after september  the company incorporates a number of third party software tools into its products 
the company has performed limited testing of the current versions of these software tools as part of the testing of its products and believes they are year compliant 
in addition  with respect to certain of these software tools  the company has received written representations or warranties from the vendor that these products are year compliant 
nevertheless  if one of the databases supported by the company is not fully year compliant  sales of the company s products could be impacted 
if any of the company s customers are unable to make their information technology systems year compliant in a timely fashion  they may suspend further product purchases from the company until their systems are year compliant 
because the company s customers are generally large and medium sized businesses and the company has received numerous communications from customers about their year compliance efforts  the company expects most of its customers will become year compliant in a timely fashion  although the company is not in a position to monitor their progress 
the company also plans to provide extended support for its customers during early january the company has developed and implemented a plan to determine whether its vendors  distributors and leased facilities all of which are referred to as third party suppliers are year compliant 
the plan includes the identification of principal third party suppliers  including those which are mission critical  contact with those third party suppliers to determine their level of year compliance  review of materials provided or published by third party suppliers regarding their year compliance efforts and  with respect to mission critical third party suppliers  some form of additional verification of compliance and internal testing 
the company initiated this process before the end of calendar year contingency plans have been or are being developed for those not expected to be year compliant 
the company believes it has a limited number of mission critical third party suppliers for which it can reasonably arrange alternatives excluding utilities and similar providers and believes that there are multiple alternatives for most of its mission critical requirements  including handling certain of these functions internally 
the company has developed a disaster contingency plan for its corporate headquarters to maintain communications  computer and network access and limited helpline support for its customers in the event of a short term power failure 
in the event of a long term power or communications failure  the failure of a mission critical application or the unavailability of a principal third party supplier  the company s operations could be materially  adversely affected 
the company has completed the assessment of its principal internal information technology systems for year compliance 
with respect to these eight principal systems  the company has upgraded or replaced all of these systems with year compliant versions 
the company engaged a third party to assess the company s personal computer and network hardware and software for year compliance and to help develop a plan to make necessary modifications 
the assessment began in the fourth quarter of calendar year and was completed in the first half of calendar year remediation of any non compliant personal computer and network hardware and software was substantially completed in the first half of calendar year the company believes that all mission critical desktop and network systems have now been remediated and are currently year compliant  but the company has contingency plans in the event that these systems encounter problems 
a failure of one or more of these internal systems to be year compliant  particularly the company s principal internal information technology systems  could require the company to manually process information or could prevent or limit access to mission critical information 
the company s non information technology systems consist principally of telephone and data communication systems 
the company has completed the assessment of these systems for year compliance and remediation has been completed 
most of the costs incurred by the company to date on year compliance issues have been internal staff costs and costs relating to normal product upgrades  which would have been incurred in any event 
the company estimates that it has spent approximately million in fiscal on personnel  upgrades and consulting  which are directly or indirectly related to year compliance 
the company presently expects that its future costs relating to year compliance for periods after june   including replacement systems  will be approximately million 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of uncertainties  which could result in actual costs exceeding the estimated amounts including  but not limited to  undetected errors or defects discovered in connection with the remediation process  or operation of the company s systems after december   resulting in the need to either replace more of the systems than originally expected and or hire more personnel or third party firms to assist in the remediation process  or the failure of a third party supplier to become year compliant  resulting in the need for the company to implement contingency plans  the cost of which are not included in the above estimates 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
while the company believes that its efforts to address year issues for which it is responsible should be successful  a description of its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios have been described above 
in addition  it is possible that there will be undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions in the company s current products and internal systems or those of its key vendors 
if any of the foregoing scenarios should occur  it is possible that the company could be involved in litigation 
further  although the company does not believe that it has any obligation to continue to support prior versions of its products after the termination of maintenance contracts covering those products  nor any obligation to make prior versions of its products  including custom applications written by the company  year compliant  it is possible that its customers may take a contrary position and initiate litigation 
because of the unprecedented nature of the litigation in this area  it is uncertain how the company may be affected by it 
in the event of such litigation or the occurrence of one or more of the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios  the company s revenues  net income or financial condition could be materially  adversely affected 
safe harbor statement certain information in this form k report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including those concerning the company s future results  strategy and product releases 
actual results could differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the demand for the company s products and services  the size  timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition and pricing pressures from competitors  the company s success in and expense associated with developing  introducing and shipping new products  new product introductions and announcements by the company s competitors  changes in company strategy  product life cycles  the cost and continued availability of third party software and technology incorporated into the company s products  the impact of rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards and changes in customer requirements  including the impact on the company s revenues of microsoft s olap database  the impact of recent changes in north american and international sales personnel and the overall competition for key employees  cancellations of maintenance and support agreements  software defects  changes in operating expenses  variations in the amount of cost savings anticipated to result from cost reduction actions  the impact of cost reduction actions on the company s operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  the impact of undetected errors or defects associated with the year date functions on the company s current products and internal systems  the ability of the company to generate sufficient future taxable income or to execute available tax strategies required to realize deferred tax assets  economic conditions generally or in specific industry segments  risks inherent in seeking and consummating acquisitions  including the diversion of management attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  the ability of the company to successfully integrate acquired businesses and the impact on the company s results and financial condition from debt issued  liabilities acquired and additional expenses incurred in connection with such acquisitions 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenue in any quarter is typically derived from non recurring license fees  a substantial portion of which is booked in the last month of a quarter 
since the purchase of the company s products is relatively discretionary and generally involves a significant commitment of capital  in the event of any downturn in any potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
further  the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue and a significant portion of the company s expenses do not vary with revenue 
as a result  if revenue is below expectations  results of operations are likely to be materially  adversely affected
