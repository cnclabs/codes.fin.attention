in results of operations sales from continuing operations in were million surpassing sales of million by almost million  or more than ten percent 
the majority of the increase in sales was attributable to the acquisition in july of ge s domestic compressor motor business 
the higher sales also benefited from a full year of sales from the acquisition of uppco  a manufacturer of subfractional horsepower c frame electric motors made in march and a resurgence in the domestic air conditioning market 
the strong electric motor sales in combined with moderate growth in sales of commercial water heating equipment more than offset declines in sales of fiberglass pipe and storage tank products 
sales in increased approximately million compared with sales of million  primarily as a result of million of additional sales associated with the aforementioned acquisition of uppco 
the company s gross profit margin for continuing operations in was percent  essentially the same as the percent margin in and a full percentage point less than the margin of percent 
the unfavorable trend in margin from to was due to the lower margin associated with subfractional motors as well as the pricing concessions that were prevalent in the water heater industry 
sales for the electric motor technologies segment in increased million or almost percent to a record million from sales of million 
sales in were million 
most of the increase in sales in was due to the previously discussed compressor motor acquisition and the recognition of a full year of sales from the uppco acquisition 
sales were also bolstered by a recovery in the hermetic motor business resulting from improvement in the heating  ventilating and air conditioning industry hvac 
the increase in sales from to was due to the acquisition of uppco 
earnings for the electric motor technologies segment in were million or almost percent higher than the million earned in earnings in were million 
the continuing improvement in earnings over this time period resulted primarily from the higher sales volume 
sales for the water systems technologies segment increased modestly from million in to million in sales in were million 
the growth in sales resulted from higher sales of commercial water heaters resulting from a strong commercial construction market and an expanded commercial product offering as well as record sales performance by the segment s european operations 
sales in declined from the levels achieved in primarily as a result of lower industry unit volumes and prices for residential products 
earnings for water systems technologies have remained fairly constant over the past three years 
the favorable impact of improving commercial sales and ongoing cost reduction activities have been offset by an aggressive pricing environment in the residential market segment  as well as costs to start up a new manufacturing facility and develop distributor channels for its chinese operation 
during the fourth quarter of  the company acquired the percent share owned by its partner in the chinese operation and established the nanjing operation as a wholly foreign owned enterprise 
sales for the other segment declined from million in to million in sales in were million

outlook for  the company expects the difficulties at its storage and fiberglass products businesses to persist and is cautiously optimistic about the market for the products of its water systems business segment 
the company believes the electric motors business will improve over as it benefits from the incremental business of the compressor motor acquisition as well as the tier one supply agreement signed with york international in july the company continues to aggressively pursue accretive acquisitions such as the uppco c frame motor business and the previously discussed scottsville compressor motor business 
the company considers the pursuit of such acquisitions to be a very important element in its strategy for growth  especially considering the slower near term prospects of its non motor businesses 
although the company believes earnings  excluding acquisitions  will increase over levels  accretive acquisitions will be required to achieve its target of percent annual growth in earnings per share 
the company recently indicated that it is comfortable with analyst estimates for ranging between and per share 
other matters year the company continues its efforts begun several years ago to address its potential year yk issues 
it has organized its activities to prepare for yk under a company wide plan that involves four steps assessment  modification  testing and implementation 
the company s business segments operate independently of each other 
each business segment has a core of full time individuals who have been assigned specific yk responsibilities in addition to their regular assignments 
the yk readiness project is a company wide effort and is monitored centrally 
the assessment phase is complete and the modification phase is nearing completion 
key customers  vendors and service providers have been queried about their yk readiness and their responses are being analyzed 
follow up efforts have commenced to obtain feedback from critical suppliers 
the testing and implementation phases for renovated information technology it systems are underway 
implementation of all new and renovated systems that are yk compliant should be completed by the end of the first quarter of testing should be completed by the end of the company anticipates that it will be yk compliant by the end of with respect to internal it and non it systems and does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its business operations  products or financial prospects 
costs specifically associated with renovating software for yk readiness are funded through operating cash flows and expensed as incurred 
yk related costs have not had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company expects to incur total costs of approximately million on the yk problem of which the remaining costs are estimated to be thousand 
costs of replacing some of the company s systems with year compliant systems have been capitalized as these new systems were acquired for business reasons and not to remediate yk problems  if any  in the former systems 
the company believes that all critical it and non it systems and processes will be yk compliant and allow the company to continue operations in the year and beyond with no material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
unanticipated problems including but not limited to  critical suppliers and business partners not meeting their commitments to be yk ready and the loss of critical skilled personnel  could result in an undetermined financial risk 
as part of its ongoing year project  business continuity plans may be expanded by the middle of for potential contingencies regarding currently unforeseen yk problems 
environmental the company s operations are governed by a number of federal  state and local environmental laws concerning the generation and management of hazardous materials  the discharge of pollutants into the environment and remediation of sites owned by the company or third parties 
the company has expended substantial financial and managerial resources complying with such laws 
expenditures related to environmental matters were not material in and are not expected to be material in any single year 
although the company believes that its operations are in compliance with such laws and maintains procedures designed to maintain compliance  there are no assurances that substantial additional costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future 
however  since the same laws govern the company s competitors  the company should not be placed at a competitive disadvantage 
market risk the company is exposed to various types of market risks  primarily currency and certain commodities 
the company monitors its risks in such areas on a continuous basis and  generally enters into futures contracts to minimize such exposures for periods of less than one year 
the company does not engage in speculation in its derivatives strategies 
further discussion regarding derivative instruments is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity risks include raw material price fluctuations 
the company uses futures contracts to fix the cost of its expected needs with the objective of reducing risk 
futures contracts are purchased over time periods and at volume levels which approximate expected usage 
at december   the company had commodity futures contracts amounting to approximately million of commodity purchases 
a hypothetical percent change in the underlying commodity price of such contracts would have a potential impact of million 
it is important to note that gains and losses from the company s future contract activities would be offset by gains and losses in the underlying commodity purchase transactions being hedged 
in addition  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
at december   the company had foreign currency contracts outstanding of approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical percent movement in the respective currencies  the potential foreign exchange gain or loss associated with the change in rates would amount to million 
it is important to note that gains and losses from the company s forward contract activities would be offset by gains and losses in the underlying transactions being hedged 
the majority of the company s debt is at fixed rates with insurance companies at various maturities 
the interest income on the company s cash equivalents is subject to short term rate fluctuations 
due to the short term nature of cash investments and the majority of debt being held at fixed rates  the company would not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
forward looking statements certain statements in this report are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business  there can be no assurance that its financial goals will be realized 
although a significant portion of the company s sales are derived from the replacement of previously installed product and such sales are therefore less volatile  numerous factors may affect actual results and may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
among such numerous factors the company includes the continued growth of the worldwide heating  ventilating and air conditioning market  the weather and its impact on the heating and air conditioning market  the pricing environment for residential water heaters  capital spending trends in the oil  petrochemical and chemical markets  and the successful development of the company s business in china
