item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is an independent exploration and production company that applies d seismic imaging and other advanced technologies to systematically explore and develop onshore oil and natural gas provinces in the united states 
from inception in through december   brigham acquired  square miles of d seismic data  identified an estimated  potential drilling locations and drilled wells delineated by d seismic analysis 
through its d seismic based drilling efforts  the company had discovered an aggregate of bcfe of net proved reserves as of december  the company believes this performance demonstrates a systematic methodology for finding oil and natural gas in onshore domestic oil and natural gas provinces 
combining its geologic and geophysical expertise with a sophisticated land effort  the company manages the majority of its projects from conception through d acquisition  processing and interpretation and leasing 
in addition  the company manages the negotiation and drafting of most of its geophysical exploration agreements  resulting in reduced contract risk and more consistent deal terms 
because it generates most of its projects  the company can control the size of the working interest that it retains as well as the selection of the operator and the non operating participants 
consistent with its business strategy  brigham has increased the working interest it retained in its projects  based on capital availability and perceived risk 
the company s average working interest in its d seismic projects acquired during  and was  and  respectively  while its average working interest in its wells drilled during this period was  and  respectively 
beginning in  the company has managed operations through the drilling and production phases on an increasing portion of its d seismic projects 
brigham operated of its gross wells and of its net wells drilled in as compared with of its gross wells and of its net wells drilled in expenditures made in oil and natural gas exploration vary from project to project depending primarily on the costs related to land  seismic acquisition  drilling costs and the working interest retained by the company 
historically  the company s participants have typically borne a disproportionate share of the costs of optioning available acreage and acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic data  and the company and its participants each typically incurred leasing  drilling and completion costs in proportion to their ownership interests 
in recent years  brigham has retained majority working interests in its new d seismic projects  and has thereby reduced the financial leverage it has historically received on the costs of optioning available acreage and acquiring  processing and interpreting the d seismic data on its projects 
from inception through  the company acquired  gross net square miles of d seismic data 
initially  the company focused its efforts in west texas 
in  the company began to devote substantial attention to the anadarko basin  and since the company has devoted the majority of its resources to the anadarko basin and gulf coast 
with this shift in regional focus  the majority of the company s production volumes has shifted from oil to natural gas 
to finance these project generation and drilling activities  the company supplemented cash flow from operations with private placements of debt and equity  commercial bank credit facilities and placements of working interests in projects with industry participants 
as the company s cash flows from operations and other sources of capital have increased during this period  it retained larger average working interests in its projects 
in and  the company acquired  gross  net square miles of d seismic and continued to focus the majority of its d exploration efforts in the anadarko basin and the gulf coast 
during the past two years  the company acquired  square miles of d seismic in the anadarko basin  making this basin the most active d seismic acquisition province for the company 
brigham also significantly increased its gulf coast activity  acquiring square miles of d seismic in this period 
during and  the company drilled gross net wells based on its d seismic data analysis 
in addition to its drilling activities  the company acquired net bcfe of proved reserves and an interest in undeveloped acreage the chitwood acquisition at the northern end of the carter knox anticline in grady county  oklahoma for million in november as a result of these activities  the company s net natural gas and oil production increased from bcfe in to bcfe in the company s net production volumes consisted of natural gas on an equivalent basis during the fourth quarter as compared with during the fourth quarter the company supplemented cash flow from operations in and with borrowings under commercial bank credit facilities  million raised in its initial public offering of common stock in may  million raised through the placement of debt and equity securities in august and the placement of working interests in projects to industry participants to finance its project generation  property acquisition and drilling activities 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain internal costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in the amortizable base of the full cost pool as incurred 
upon the interpretation by the company of the d seismic associated with unproved properties  the geological and geophysical costs of acreage that is not specifically identified as prospective are transferred to the amortizable base of the full cost pool 
geological and geophysical costs associated with prospective acreage  as well as leasehold costs  are transferred to the amortizable base of the full cost pool when the prospects are drilled 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
to the extent that the costs capitalized in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate and based on period end natural gas and oil prices of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves plus the capitalized cost of unproved properties  such costs are charged to operations as a writedown of the carrying value of natural gas and oil properties  or a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
the risk that the company will be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed  even if such prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if the company experiences poor drilling results or has substantial downward revisions in its estimated proved reserves 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a charge to earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and stockholders equity 
once incurred  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to natural gas and oil properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
primarily as a result of the significant declines in both oil and natural gas prices at december  and disappointing drilling results on several of the company s high working interest wells in  the company recorded a capitalized ceiling impairment charge at december  of million see note of notes to the december  consolidated financial statements 
no assurance can be given that the company will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods

in connection with the exchange in  the company issued options to purchase  shares of common stock to certain of its officers and employees 
the company recorded an unearned stock compensation balance of million in the first quarter  of which approximately one half will be added to the amortizable base of the full cost pool over the vesting period of the options and the balance will be recorded as a noncash compensation expense over the vesting period of the options 
as a result  the company expects to incur unearned stock compensation amortization expenses of approximately  in   in and an aggregate of  in the three years thereafter 
the company s predecessor was classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no income taxes were paid or provided for by the company prior to the exchange 
the company is a taxable entity 
in connection with the exchange on february   the company incurred a million charge to record a deferred income tax liability to recognize the differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of the company s predecessor partnership s natural gas and oil properties at the exchange date  given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
during the fourth quarter  the company elected to record a step up in the basis of its assets for tax purposes as a result of the exchange 
due to this election  the company recorded a million non cash deferred income tax benefit during the fourth quarter  which resulted in a net million per dividend share non cash deferred income tax charge for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data for the periods presented

see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters hedging activities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
natural gas and oil sales increased from million in to million in production volume increases accounted for million of this increase and were offset by million from a decrease in the average sales price received for natural gas and oil sales 
production volumes for natural gas increased from  mmcf in to  mmcf in the average price received for natural gas decreased from per mcf in to per mcf in production volumes for oil increased from mbbls in to mbbls in the average price received for oil decreased from per bbl in to per bbl in natural gas and oil sales in were increased by production from wells completed and flowing to sales since december   offset partially by the natural decline of existing production  and from certain wells acquired in the chitwood acquisition which were included in the company s results of operations effective september  as a result of hedging activities  natural gas revenues increased by  per mcf in  compared to a decrease in oil revenues of  per bbl in see other matters hedging activities 
workstation revenue 
workstation revenue decreased from  in to  in workstation revenue is recognized by the company as industry participants in the company s seismic programs are charged an hourly rate for the work performed by the company on its d seismic interpretation workstations 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the company s increased working interests in its recently acquired d seismic data  which reduces the amount of workstation interpretation costs that the company can bill to its participants 
the company expects workstation revenue to continue to decline in due to the company s increased working interests in the square miles of d seismic it acquired in and lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of producing wells during from those in the decrease in the per unit amount was primarily due to an increase in natural gas production as a percentage of total equivalent production in and in since a typical natural gas well produces with lower average lease operating costs per unit of production than a typical oil well 
production taxes 
production taxes increased from  per mcfe in to  per mcfe in as a direct result of increased production volumes 
the effective average production tax rate increased from of natural gas and oil sales revenues in to in due to the increase in natural gas production as a percentage of total equivalent production as natural gas is typically burdened with higher production tax rates than oil 
the decrease in the per unit amount was primarily attributable to the decline in natural gas and oil sales prices in as compared with general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in this increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses necessary to manage the company s growing operations 
the decrease in the per unit rate was a result of a greater increase in natural gas and oil production volumes than general and administrative expenses from to due to the aforementioned factors 
the company has initiated an overhead reduction plan during  consisting primarily of a company wide salary reduction beginning in the second quarter of and the elimination or reduction of various other discretionary administrative expenditures 
the company plans to continue to evaluate its overhead cost structure during the course of and may take further steps to reduce its administrative expenses depending upon the outcome of its various strategic initiatives underway to improve its capital resources and liquidity 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in of this increase  million was attributable to the increase in production volumes during the period and million was due to the increase in the depletion rate per unit of production 
the increase in depletion rate per unit of production was primarily the result of the addition of natural gas and oil reserves at higher average capital costs due to a reduction in drilling performance and downward revisions to previous reserve estimates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in due to the company s higher average outstanding debt balance in combined with a higher average effective interest rate 
the company s weighted average outstanding debt balance increased from million in to million in this increase in debt was incurred primarily to fund the company s increased capital expenditures and working capital needs  net of operating cash flow  during the effective annual interest rate on the company s outstanding indebtedness increased from in to in  primarily due to the company s issuance of million of senior subordinated secured notes due the subordinated notes in august  which bore interest at an annual rate of from the date of issuance 
in addition  interest expense in included i approximately million of non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred loan fees and the amortization of discount on the subordinated notes  and ii  of interest expenses related to the subordinated notes that was paid through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash in february pursuant to the recently amended terms of the credit facility and the subordinated notes  the company expects to pay its interest obligations related to the subordinated notes in through the issuance of additional subordinated notes in lieu of cash in an effort to preserve cash flow to fund capital expenditures and working capital 
borrowings under the company s commercial bank credit facility had an effective annual interest rate of at december  see liquidity and capital resources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  natural gas and oil sales 
natural gas and oil sales increased from million in to million in production volume increases accounted for million of this increase and were offset by  from a decrease in the average sales price received for natural gas and oil sales 
production volumes for natural gas increased from  mcf in to  mcf in the average price received for natural gas increased from per mcf in to per mcf in production volumes for oil increased from  bbls in to  bbls in the average price received for oil decreased from per bbl in to per bbl in natural gas and oil sales were increased by production from wells completed in  which was partially offset by the natural decline of existing production 
hedging activities in reduced the amount by which oil revenues increased by  compared to a decrease in oil revenues of  as a result of hedging activities in workstation revenue 
workstation revenue increased from  in to  in workstation revenue is recognized by the company as industry participants in the company s seismic programs are charged an hourly rate for the work performed by the company on its d seismic interpretation workstations 
lease operating expenses 
lease operating expenses increased from  per mcfe in to million per mcfe in the increase was primarily due to an increase in producing wells during the year 
production taxes 
production taxes increased from  per mcfe in to  per mcfe in as a direct result of increased production volumes 
the effective average production tax rate remained unchanged at of natural gas and oil sales revenues for each period 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in approximately  of the increase in resulted from nonrecurring expenses related to the company s relocation of its corporate headquarters from dallas  texas to austin  texas  and the balance was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel and related expenses necessary to manage the company s growing operations 
the increase in the per unit rate was a result of a greater increase in aggregate general and administrative expenses than natural gas and oil production volumes from to due to the aforementioned factors 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties 
depletion of natural gas and oil properties increased from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in as a result of higher production volumes 
the per unit amount decreased due to the addition of proved reserves during interest expense 
interest expense was essentially unchanged from to as the company s lower average outstanding debt balance in was offset by a higher effective average interest rate 
the weighted average outstanding debt balance decreased from million in to million in the effective interest rate increased from in to in the decrease in the weighted average outstanding debt balance and increase in the effective average interest rate resulted primarily from the conversion to equity of privately placed notes in february  the retirement of million of borrowings under its previous credit facility in connection with the company s may initial public offering  and million of borrowings incurred under its previous credit facility subsequent to the company s initial public offering to fund the company s increased exploration activity and its million acquisition of properties from mobil adjacent to its west bradley d project area 
the company s previous credit facility had an effective interest rate of at december  liquidity despite the company s success in building its inventory of d seismic data and potential drilling locations  a number of key factors have recently contributed to significantly limit the company s capital resources available to fund its continued long term growth oriented exploration strategy 
management believes these principal factors include i lower commodity sales prices  which reduced revenues and cash flow from the company s production volumes  ii reduced access to public  private and industry sources of capital on cost effective terms due to the continuing low commodity price environment and outlook  iii less than anticipated success in placing working interests with industry or financial participants in certain of its high equity interest projects  resulting in lower levels of project cost recoupment than budgeted  iv high levels of expenditures for d seismic and land activities that do not generate proved reserves and cash flow until the drilling stage of the project cycle  v the utilization of high levels of debt to fund its accelerating exploration expenditures  and vi disappointing drilling results during on a number of high equity interest exploratory and development wells  several of which were completed and subsequently plugged and abandoned or otherwise performed below expectations 
as a result of these limiting factors and an expectation for continuing difficult industry and capital markets conditions  brigham has substantially reduced its planned capital budget for and has undertaken a number of strategic initiatives in an effort to improve and preserve its capital liquidity in the current environment 
while the company remains focused on its long term growth objectives and the continuation of its established business model for d seismic based exploration  brigham has adapted its business strategy in the near term in an effort to maximize value for its shareholders on a long term basis through the implementation of the following principal strategic initiatives i focusing all of the company s planned exploration efforts in toward the drilling of its highest grade d prospects identified in its anadarko basin and gulf coast projects  concentrated primarily in trends where brigham has achieved exploration success  ii eliminating substantially all planned seismic and land expenditures for new projects until its capital resources can support such additional activity  iii seeking to divest certain producing natural gas and oil properties in an effort to raise capital to reduce debt borrowings and to redirect capital to drilling projects that have the potential to generate higher investment returns  iv restructuring its outstanding senior and subordinated debt agreements to provide the company with flexibility needed to preserve cash flow to fund its expected near term exploration activities  v implementing an overhead reduction plan to reduce general and administrative expenses  and vi evaluating opportunities to raise additional equity capital either through the sales of interests in certain of its seismic projects or the issuance of equity securities 
the company believes that the successful execution of these strategic initiatives will provide brigham with sufficient capital resources to execute its planned exploration program and position the company to realize the significant value it believes it has captured in its inventory of d seismic projects and delineated drilling locations 
while the company has initiated each of these strategic directives in late and early  and has effected certain of them to date  the successful completion of any or all of these efforts to improve the company s capital availability within the expected timeframe is uncertain and will likely have a material impact on the company s near term capital expenditure levels and growth profile 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with veritas dgc land  inc veritas to exchange  shares of newly issued brigham common stock valued at per share for approximately million of payment obligations due to veritas in for certain seismic acquisition and processing services previously performed 
in addition  this agreement provides for the payment by brigham of up to million in future seismic processing services to be performed by veritas in newly issued shares of brigham common stock valued at per share  in the event that the company does not elect to pay for such services in cash 
the settlement of these future seismic processing services will be determined on a quarterly basis through december  brigham considers this arrangement to be beneficial as it will enable the company to reduce its working capital commitments and preserve additional cash flow and capital availability to fund its drilling program 
capital resources the company s primary sources of capital have been revolving credit facility and other debt borrowings  public and private equity financings  the sale of interests in projects and funds generated by operations 
the company s primary capital requirements are d seismic acquisition  processing and interpretation costs  land acquisition costs and drilling expenditures 
during may  the company completed an initial public offering of common stock of the company that generated proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs  that were used to repay all outstanding debt million under the company s then existing revolving credit facility and to fund capital expenditures 
in january  the company entered into a new revolving credit facility that provided for borrowing availability of million that was used to repay its then outstanding borrowings under its previous credit facility and to fund capital expenditures 
in august  the company issued million of debt and equity securities  including the million of subordinated notes  that generated proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs  that were used to repay a portion of then outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  thereby increasing the company s borrowing availability under its credit facility to fund capital expenditures 
revolving credit facility in january  the company entered into a new revolving credit agreement the credit facility  which provided for borrowing availability of million 
the company used a portion of the funds available under the credit facility to repay the million in borrowings outstanding at december  under its previous commercial bank credit facility 
principal outstanding under the credit facility is due at maturity on january  with interest due monthly for base rate tranches or periodically as libor tranches mature 
the annual interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility has been either the lender s base rate or libor plus  at the company s option 
the credit facility s borrowing availability was subsequently reduced from million to million upon the company s issuance of the subordinated notes in august in march  the company and its lenders entered into an amendment to the credit facility 
pursuant to this amendment  the borrowing availability under the credit facility will remain at million until june   when the borrowing availability will be redetermined by the lenders based on the company s then proved reserve value and cash flows 
in addition  certain financial covenants of the credit facility have been amended  additional covenants have been included that place significant restrictions on the company s ability to incur certain capital expenditures  the annual interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility has been amended to the lender s base rate or libor plus  and the company will pay the lenders a  transaction fee over a ten month period 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the natural gas and oil properties and other tangible assets of the company 
at march   the company had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  which bear interest at an annual rate of 
see note of notes to the december  consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility has certain financial covenants including current and interest coverage ratios  as defined 
the company and its lenders effected the recent amendment to the credit facility to enable the company to comply with certain financial covenants of the credit facility  including the minimum current ratio  minimum interest coverage ratio and the limitation on capital expenditures related to seismic and land activities 
the company believes this most recent amendment is indicative of its lenders cooperation in the current oil and natural gas pricing environment 
if this pricing environment continues or deteriorates further beyond the date of redetermination of borrowing availability  the company believes its lenders will expect the company to substantially reduce its level of borrowing under the credit facility 
with this in mind  the company has initiated the business strategy noted above 
should the company be unable to comply with certain of the financial covenants  its lenders may be unwilling to waive compliance or amend the covenants in the future 
in such instance  the company s liquidity may be adversely affected  which could in turn have an adverse impact on the company s future financial position and results of operations 
subordinated notes in august  the company issued million of debt and equity securities to affiliates of enron corp 
enron 
securities issued by the company in connection with this financing transaction included i million of subordinated notes  ii warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share the warrants  and iii  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the approximate million in net proceeds received by the company from this financing transaction were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under its credit facility  which increased the company s borrowing availability under its credit facility to fund capital expenditures 
principal outstanding under the subordinated notes is due at maturity on august  interest on the subordinated notes is payable quarterly at rates that vary depending upon whether accrued interest is paid in cash or in kind through the issuance of additional subordinated notes pik interest 
interest shall be paid in cash at interest rates of  and per annum during years one through three  year four and year five  respectively  of the term of the subordinated notes  provided  however  that if the payment of interest accrued on the subordinated notes in cash would cause a borrowing base deficiency under the credit facility or would cause the company to be in violation of any covenant or other restriction set forth in any senior loan document or any agreement entered into by the company or subsidiary of the company in connection with the subordinated notes  the company may pay pik interest at interest rates of  and per annum during years one through three  year four and year five  respectively  of the term of the notes 
the subordinated notes rank subordinate in right of payment to senior indebtedness as defined and senior to all other financings other than any allowed capital leases and purchase money financings of the company 
the subordinated notes are secured by a second lien against substantially all of the natural gas and oil properties and other tangible assets of the company 
the subordinated notes may be prepaid at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  provided that all partial prepayments must be pro rata to the various holders of the subordinated notes 
the subordinated notes were issued pursuant to an indenture the indenture that contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make distributions  enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  dispose of certain assets  incur liens  and engage in mergers and consolidations 
in march  the company and chase bank of texas  national association  as trustee the trustee for the holders of the subordinated notes  entered into an amendment to the indenture 
this amendment provides the company with the option to pay interest due on the subordinated notes in kind  for any reason  through the second quarter of in addition  certain financial and other covenants were amended 
the amendment also provides for a reduction in the exercise price per share of the warrants from per share to per share 
the indenture governing the subordinated notes has certain financial covenants including current and interest coverage ratios  as defined 
the company and the holders of the subordinated notes effected the recent amendment to the indenture to enable the company to comply with certain financial covenants of the indenture that parallel those of the credit facility  including the minimum current ratio and the minimum interest coverage ratio 
should the company be unable to comply with certain of the financial covenants  the holders of the subordinated notes may be unwilling to waive compliance or amend the covenants in the future 
in such instance  the company s liquidity may be adversely affected  which could in turn have an adverse impact on the company s future financial position and results of operations 
cash flow analysis cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in  million in  and million in the increase in cash flows for compared to was due primarily to an increase in natural gas and oil revenues  net of lease operating expenses  production taxes and general and administrative expenses  and net changes in working capital items 
the increase in cash flows for compared to was due primarily to an increase in natural gas and oil revenues  net of lease operating expenses  production taxes and general and administrative expenses 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities increased to million in compared to million in and million in these increases are directly related to an increase in capital expenditures related to the company s exploration and development activities 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in the company acquired  gross net square miles of d seismic in   gross net square miles in  and gross net square miles in the company s drilling efforts resulted in the completion of wells net in  wells net in and wells net in  which resulted in aggregate net increases in proved reserve volumes net of revisions to previous estimates of bcfe in  bcfe in  and bcfe in in addition  the company sold certain producing properties in for million and acquired certain producing properties and related interests for million in and million in cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows provided by financing activities for were million  primarily as a result of borrowings under the credit facility  the issuance of the subordinated notes and the sale of million of common stock 
cash flows from financing activities for were million  primarily as a result of borrowings under the company s previous credit facility and proceeds from the common stock sold in the company s initial public offering 
cash flows from financing activities for were million  primarily as a result of borrowings under the company s previous credit facility 
capital expenditures as a result of the company s limited available capital resources  brigham has significantly reduced its planned capital expenditure budget for from the company s previously anticipated levels in an effort to match the its current and expected future capital resources 
the company s current capital budget is estimated to be million  or approximately of expenditures 
the company s budgeted capital expenditures consist of approximately million to drill an estimated to gross wells  million for seismic and land costs  consisting primarily of previous year commitments and obligations to acquire d data and acreage  and million for capitalized general and administrative expenses and other fixed asset expenditures 
brigham expects that its drilling expenditures will be allocated approximately to its anadarko basin province and to its gulf coast province  and such expenditures will be devoted to the drilling of the highest grade prospects in the company s inventory of identified potential drilling locations 
the company intends to fund these budgeted capital expenditures through a combination of cash flow from operations  available borrowings under its credit facility and the sales of certain assets including the potential divestitures of certain producing property packages from among its anadarko basin properties and interests in certain d seismic projects 
in addition to these sources of capital  the company is also evaluating opportunities to raise additional capital to enable it to increase its planned capital expenditures for drilling in however  since the company s capital availability during will depend to a large extent on the company s success raising additional financing through its planned and potential strategic initiatives  the company s actual capital expenditures may differ from its current estimates 
in the event additional financing is not available in the amounts or timing needed  the company may be required to curtail its planned exploration activities in and take further measures to reduce the size and scope of its business

other matters hedging activities the company believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows the company to reduce its exposure to natural gas and oil sales price fluctuations and thereby to achieve more predictable cash flows 
however  hedging arrangements  when utilized  limit the benefit to the company of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  the company s hedging arrangements apply only to a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
the company expects that the amount of its hedges will vary from time to time

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in the company  in an attempt to reduce its sensitivity to volatile commodity prices  began using crude oil swap arrangements resulting in a fixed price over a period of six months 
total oil purchased and sold subject to swap arrangements entered into by the company was  bbls in and  bbls in the company accounts for all these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  adjusts the price received for natural gas and oil production during the period the hedged transactions occur 
adjustments to the price received for oil under these swap arrangements resulted in an increase in oil revenues of  in and decreases in oil revenues of  in and  in as of december   the company had no hedging contracts outstanding 
in  the company began using natural gas swap arrangements in an attempt to reduce its sensitivity to volatile commodity prices as its production base became increasingly weighted toward natural gas 
pursuant to these arrangements the company exchanges a floating market price for a fixed contract price 
payments are made by the company when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month and payments are received by the company when the fixed price exceeds the floating price 
settlements of these swaps are based on the difference between the anr pipeline co

for the year ended december   the company realized an increase in revenues attributable to natural gas hedges of  effects of inflation and changes in prices the company s results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing natural gas and oil prices 
if the price of natural gas and oil increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in revenues as well as the operating costs that the company is required to bear for operations 
inflation has had a minimal effect on the company 
environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and marketing of natural gas and oil  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity

year issues many computer software systems  as well as certain hardware and equipment using date sensitive data  were structured to use a two digit date field meaning that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year the company has developed a plan to address this issue and is taking steps to review its information technology systems  such as computer hardware and software  as well as non information technology systems  including computer controlled equipment and electronic devices used to operate equipment involved in processing and interpreting d seismic data 
the company has completed the initial phases of its plan by identifying all computerized systems and substantially completing an inventory of its equipment and component parts 
both information technology and non information technology systems may contain embedded technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the company continues to inventory its equipment and facilities to determine if they contain embedded date sensitive technology 
the company is currently reviewing all of its systems to determine which are not year compliant and will need to be replaced or modified 
this current phase includes comparisons of inventory to manufacturer s information and or performance testing 
if problems are identified  the company will undertake remediation  replacement or alternative procedures for non compliant equipment or facilities on a business priority basis 
the company s identification and assessment efforts to date have not identified any computer equipment or software it currently uses which will require replacement or modification  except that one of the word processing software programs the company uses may be non compliant and may need to be discontinued or upgraded 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company attempts to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
the company currently anticipates that its identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts will continue and  depending upon the results of the assessment efforts  be completed during the first three quarters of as of december   all costs incurred by the company in connection with its year compliance efforts were included within the company s normal general and administrative expenses for example  regular maintenance of software programs 
the company is currently expensing as incurred all costs related to the assessment and remediation of the year issue  and these costs are being funded through operating cash flow 
however  in certain instances the company may determine that replacing existing equipment may be appropriate and may capitalize such replacements 
the company is unable currently to estimate the amount of its total out of pocket costs to become year compliant  but the company currently expects that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operations or liquidity 
the foregoing timetable and assessment of costs to become year compliant reflect management s current best estimates 
these estimates are based on many assumptions  including assumptions about the cost  availability and ability of resources to locate  remediate and modify affected systems  equipment and facilities 
based upon its activities to date  the company does not currently believe that these factors will cause results to differ significantly from those estimated 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial condition and operations if key third parties including  among others  suppliers  contractors  joint venture partners  financial institutions  customers and governments do not become year compliant on a timely basis 
the company is currently identifying third parties whose business significantly impacts the company  has contacted some significant third parties to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues  and will contact others as it completes the identification phase 
in the event that the company is unable to complete the remediation or replacement of its critical systems  facilities and equipment  establish alternative procedures in a timely manner  or if those with whom the company conducts business are unsuccessful in implementing timely solutions  year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
at this time  the potential effect in the event the company and or third parties are unable to timely resolve their year problems is not determinable 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
however  the company currently believes that it will be able to resolve its own year issues in a timely manner

forward looking information brigham or its representatives may make forward looking statements  oral or written  including statements in this report  press releases and filings with the sec  regarding estimated future net revenues from oil and natural gas reserves and the present value thereof  planned capital expenditures including the amount and nature thereof  increases in oil and gas production  the number of wells the company anticipates drilling through and the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the company will be realized or  even if substantially realized  that they will have the expected effects on its business or operations 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are general economic conditions  inherent uncertainties in interpreting engineering data  operating hazards  delays or cancellations of drilling operations for a variety of reasons  competition  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  the ability of the company to successfully integrate the business and operations of acquired companies  government regulations and other factors set forth among the risk factors noted below or in the description of the company s business in item of this report 
all subsequent oral and written forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors

risk factors effects of leverage 
the company had long term debt outstanding of million principal amount as of december  and million principal amount as of march  the indenture limits the amounts of additional debt borrowings  including borrowings under the credit facility or other senior indebtedness as defined 
however  the indenture permits the company to borrow under the credit facility up to the lesser of million or the borrowing base under the credit facility million as of december  and march   which would provide the company with the ability to borrow up to million of additional indebtedness under its credit facility as of december  and march  in addition  the indenture allows the company to borrow up to million of future subordinated indebtedness that is pari passu in right of payment with the subordinated notes if the holders of the subordinated notes have been given a first look and right to make a proposal for such subordinated indebtedness 
the company s level of indebtedness will have several important effects on its operations  including i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture limit its ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets and may affect the company s flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions and iii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
moreover  future exploration  development or acquisition activities may require the company to alter its capitalization significantly 
these changes in capitalization may significantly alter the leverage of the company 
the company s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce its total indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of the company  many of which are beyond its control 
there can be no assurance that the company s future performance will not be adversely affected by such economic conditions and financial  business and other factors 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
substantial capital requirements  limited current liquidity 
the company makes and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in its exploration and development projects 
the company s available capital resources at march  are limited and not sufficient to fund its planned working capital needs and capital expenditures for the company intends to finance these working capital needs and planned capital expenditures with cash flow from operations  borrowings available under the credit facility  the potential sales of interests in certain producing properties and d seismic projects and the potential issuance of additional equity securities 
additional financing will be required in the future to fund the company s exploratory and developmental drilling and d seismic acquisition activities at currently budgeted levels 
no assurance can be given as to the availability or terms of any such additional financing that may be required or that financing will continue to be available under the existing or new financing arrangements 
if additional capital resources are not available to the company  its drilling and other activities may be curtailed and its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
dependence on exploratory drilling activities 
the company s revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent upon the success of its exploratory drilling program 
exploratory drilling involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
despite the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies  exploratory drilling remains a speculative activity 
even when fully utilized and properly interpreted  d seismic data and other advanced technologies only assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures 
in addition  the use of d seismic data and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies  and the company could incur losses as a result of such expenditures 
the company s future drilling activities may not be successful 
there can be no assurance that the company s overall drilling success rate or its drilling success rate for activity within a particular province will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company often gathers d seismic data over large areas 
the company s interpretation of data delineates those portions of an area desirable for drilling 
therefore  the company may choose not to acquire option and lease rights prior to acquiring seismic and  in many cases  the company may identify a drilling location before seeking option or lease rights in the location 
although the company has identified numerous potential drilling locations  there can be no assurance that they will ever be leased or drilled or that natural gas or oil will be produced from these or any other potential drilling locations 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
the company s revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent upon the prices received for the company s oil and natural gas 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
various factors beyond the control of the company will affect prices of its oil and natural gas  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and the overall economic environment 
during  the high and low prices for oil on the nymex were per bbl and per bbl  and the high and low prices for natural gas on the nymex were per mmbtu and per mmbtu 
the recent decline in oil prices is generally thought to be caused primarily by an oversupply of worldwide crude oil inventory created  in part  by unusually warm winters in the united states and europe in and  an announced increase in crude oil production quotas for opec countries in late and a possible decline in demand in certain asian markets 
the recent decline in natural gas prices is generally thought to be caused primarily by an oversupply of domestic natural gas inventory created  in part  by reduced demand for natural gas due to unusually warm winters in the united states in and it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
if such declines in the nymex crude oil or natural gas prices worsen or persist for a protracted period  it would adversely affect the company s revenues  net income and cash flows from operations 
also  if these prices maintain their present level for an extended time period or decline further  the company may delay or postpone certain of its capital projects 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company can produce economically 
any significant decline in the price of natural gas or oil would adversely affect the company s revenues and operating income and may require a reduction in the carrying value of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
see item business competition and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
historical operating losses and variability of operating results 
the company had net losses of approximately million in  million in   in  million including a net million non cash deferred income tax charge incurred in connection with the company s conversion from a partnership to a corporation in  and million including a million non cash writedown in the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties in the company has incurred net losses in each year of operation  and there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable in the future 
at december   the company s accumulated earnings were a deficit of million and its total stockholders equity was million 
in addition  the company s future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including industry conditions  prices of oil and natural gas  rates of drilling success  rates of production from completed wells and the timing and amount of capital expenditures 
this variability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any failure or delay in the realization of expected cash flows from operating activities could limit the company s ability to invest and participate in economically attractive projects 
see item selected financial data and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reserve replacement risk 
in general  production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent the company conducts successful exploration and development activities or acquires properties containing proved reserves  or both  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced 
the company s future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon its ability to economically find  develop or acquire reserves in commercial quantities 
the business of exploring for or developing reserves is capital intensive 
to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable  the company s ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand its asset base of oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired 
the company participates in a percentage of its wells as a non operator 
the failure of an operator of the company s wells to adequately perform operations  or an operator s breach of the applicable agreements  could adversely impact the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s future exploration and development activities will result in additional proved reserves or that the company will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
furthermore  although the company s revenues could increase if prevailing prices for oil and natural gas increase significantly  the company s finding and development costs could also increase 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
the company s operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  encountering formations with abnormal pressures  blowouts  cratering  pipeline ruptures and spills  any of which can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to properties of the company and others 
as protection against operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses 
the company may elect to self insure if management believes that the cost of insurance  although available  is excessive relative to the risks presented 
the company generally maintains insurance for the hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas and believes this insurance is adequate 
nevertheless  the occurrence of an event that is not covered  or not fully covered  by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
see item business and properties operating hazards and uninsured risks and uncertainty of reserve information and future net revenue estimates 
numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values  including many factors beyond the company s control 
the reserve information in herein is an estimate only 
although the company believes these estimates are reasonable  reserve estimates are imprecise and are expected to change as additional information becomes available 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves by necessity are projections based on engineering data  and uncertainties are inherent in the interpretation of this data  the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geologic interpretation  and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows may vary substantially 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s reserves will ultimately be produced or that the company s proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within the periods anticipated 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the company s reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
see item business and properties oil and natural gas reserves 
the present value of future net revenues referred to herein should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the company s properties 
in accordance with applicable requirements of the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  curtailments or increases in consumption by gas purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value  will be affected by the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with development and production of oil and natural gas properties 
in addition  the discount factor  which must be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for sec reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the company or the oil and gas industry in general 
competition 
the company operates in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production with other companies 
in seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration and in marketing its oil and natural gas production  as well as in seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop those properties  the company faces intense competition from a large number of independent  technology driven companies as well as both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to the company 
the effects of this highly competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on the company 
see item business competition 
compliance with government regulations 
the company s business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and marketing of  oil and natural gas  as well as safety matters 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
see item business governmental regulation 
compliance with environmental regulations 
the company s operations are subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
environmental laws and regulations are frequently changed 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the discharge of natural gas  oil  or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on the part of the company to the government and third parties and may require the company to incur substantial costs of remediation 
no assurance can be given that existing environmental laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
see item business environmental matters 
risk of hedging activities 
in an attempt to reduce its sensitivity to energy price volatility  the company uses swap arrangements that generally result in a fixed price over a period of six to eighteen months 
if the company s reserves are not produced at rates equivalent to the hedged position  the company would be required to satisfy its obligations under hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of its own production 
further  the terms under which the company enters into hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation costs to delivery points 
substantial variations between the assumptions and estimates used by the company and actual results experienced could materially adversely affect the company s anticipated profit margins and its ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
additionally  hedging contracts limit the benefits the company will realize if actual prices rise above the contract prices 
in addition  hedging contracts are subject to the risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts 
any significant nonperformance could have a material adverse financial effect on the company 
for the year ended december   the company realized an increase in revenues attributable to natural gas hedges of  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters hedging activities and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
marketability of production 
the marketability of the company s production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
the company generally delivers natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that it does not own 
federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions all could adversely affect the company s ability to produce and market its oil and natural gas 
any dramatic change in market factors could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel 
the company has assembled a team of geologists  geophysicists and engineers having considerable experience applying d imaging technology 
the company is dependent upon the knowledge  skills and experience of these experts to provide d imaging and assist the company in reducing the risks associated with its participation in oil and natural gas exploration projects 
in addition  the success of the company s business also depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and continued efforts of its management  particularly ben m 
brigham  the company s chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board 
the company has an employment agreement with ben m 
brigham  but does not have an employment agreement with any of its other employees 
the company has key man life insurance on mr 
brigham in the amount of million 
the loss of services of key management personnel or the company s technical experts  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  development efforts and ability to grow 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such executives  geophysicists  geologists and engineers 
see item business exploration staff and executive officers of the registrant 
control by existing stockholders 
as of march   directors  executive officers and principal stockholders of the company  and certain of their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  as a group  will be able to control the outcome of stockholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in the company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons make it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect the management or direction of the company 
these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of the company 
certain antitakeover considerations 
the company s certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors of the company to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights  of those shares as the board of directors may determine 
these provisions  alone or in combination with the matters described in risk factors control by existing stockholders  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control of the company  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock 
the company also is subject to provisions of the delaware general corporation law that may make some business combinations more difficult 
year compliance 
many computer software systems  as well as certain hardware and equipment using date sensitive data  were structured to use a two digit date field meaning that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year the company currently expects that any costs necessary for the company to become year compliant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operations or liquidity 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial condition and operations if key third parties including  among others  suppliers  contractors  joint venture partners  financial institutions  customers and governments do not become year compliant on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete any necessary remediation or replacement of its critical systems  facilities and equipment or establish alternative procedures in a timely manner  that those with whom the company conduct business will be successful in implementing timely solutions  or that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and result of operations other matters year issues 
possible stock price volatility 
the trading price of the common stock and the price at which the company may sell securities in the future could be subject to large fluctuations in response to limited trading volume in the company s stock and changes in government regulations  quarterly variations in operating results  litigation  general market conditions  the prices of natural gas and oil  announcements by the company and its competitors  the liquidity of the company  the company s ability to raise additional funds and other events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments the company limits its use of derivative instruments principally to commodity price hedging activities  whereby gains and losses are generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity 
as a result  management believes that its use of derivative instruments does not expose the company to material risk 
the company s use of derivative instruments for hedging activities could materially affect the company s results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods since such instruments can limit the company s ability to benefit from favorable oil and natural gas price movements 
however  management believes that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
commodity price risk the company s primary commodity market risk exposure is to changes in the prices related to the sale of its oil and natural gas production 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
as such  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the sales prices it receives for its oil and natural gas production through hedging activities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other matters hedging activities 
the company believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows the company to reduce its exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby to achieve more predictable cash flows 
however  hedging arrangements  when utilized  limit the benefit to the company of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  the company s hedging arrangements apply only to a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
the company expects that the amount of its hedges will vary from time to time 
based on the company s natural gas swap arrangements outstanding at december   an adverse change defined as a hypothetical and increase in underlying commodity prices for open positions would lower revenue and income before taxes by approximately  and million  respectively  from currently projected levels 
additionally  as the company utilizes swap arrangements to hedge anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by price changes in the underlying commodity 
the impact of these price changes are not reflected in this sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company does not utilize derivative instruments to protect against changes in interest rates on debt borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial instruments at december
