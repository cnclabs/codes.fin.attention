item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company background commscope  inc commscope or the company was incorporated in delaware in january and  through its wholly owned subsidiary  commscope  inc of north carolina commscope nc  formerly a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of general instrument corporation general instrument  operates in the cable manufacturing business 
the company s operations are conducted within one business segment that designs  manufactures and markets coaxial  fiber optic and high performance electronic cables primarily used in communications  local area network and industrial applications 
commscope is a leading manufacturer and supplier of coaxial cable for cable television applications and other communications applications in the united states 
commscope is also a leading supplier of coaxial cable to international cable television markets 
on july  the distribution date  through a series of transactions and stockholder dividends initiated by general instrument the distribution  commscope nc became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
general instrument retained no ownership interest in commscope nc or the company  which commenced operations as an independent entity with publicly traded common stock on the distribution date 
the company s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the distribution date reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of commscope nc that were included in the consolidated financial statements of general instrument 
these financial results include the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses directly attributable to the company s operations and an allocation of certain assets  liabilities  general corporate and administrative expenses  and net interest expense from general instrument 
management believes the assumptions underlying these financial statements are reasonable  although these financial statements may not necessarily reflect the results of operations or financial position had commscope been a separate  stand alone entity 
financial highlights for the three year period  commscope reported the following in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  a a net income    net income per share assuming dilution net income  excluding certain one time events    net income per share assuming dilution  excluding certain one time events a net income and net income per share information for and are presented on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the distribution in july one time events during include an after tax profit of million related to the sale of certain real and personal property and inventories of the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business and an after tax benefit of million related to the partial reversal of after tax charges associated with a closed australian joint venture 
one time events during include an after tax charge of million associated with the closing of an australian joint venture 
the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in the annual report  should be read as an integral part of the financial highlights and the following financial review 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million in  a decrease of 
the following table presents the company s revenues in millions by product line and domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and  respectively net of net of sales net sales sales net sales catv products lan products other products total domestic sales international sales total commscope is a leading manufacturer and supplier of coaxial cable for cable television applications and other video telecommunications applications including in home video wiring  broadcast and security collectively referred to as catv products in the united states and internationally 
sales of catv products represented of the company s net sales in  compared to in overall sales of catv products in decreased by compared to domestically  sales of catv products increased by  driven primarily by increased sales to multiple system operators using hfc networks  who continued their system upgrading activities 
international sales of which over are for catv products decreased  or million  in from international sales of million 
sales to latin america and the pacific rim were affected due to the economic turmoil experienced in those regions during sales to the pacific rim were also negatively affected by decreased sales activity in australia million in compared to million in management remains guarded about the near term outlook for international sales 
excluding the seneffe acquisition discussed below  which is expected to provide approximately sales growth in  management expects the company s overall international sales to be relatively unchanged compared to the company cannot predict with certainty the outlook for international sales in  however  and the continued economic turmoil in international markets could result in lower international sales in compared to the company expects that international sales in should be impacted favorably by the announced acquisition of alcatel s coaxial cable business in seneffe  belgium effective january  
this acquisition provides the company with a european base of operations  access to established distribution channels and complementary coaxial cable technologies 
to complement its offering of catv products  the company continues to focus on growth opportunities for products used in local area network applications lan products 
as a leader in the concept of high performance premise wiring cable  sales of lan products have grown from approximately million in to million in  before decreasing in to million 
although the sales of enhanced cable continued to be strong  many of the distributors of generic cable had unanticipated high inventory levels late in resulting in reduced sales to those distributors 
the company anticipates that the lower sales levels of the fourth quarter are temporary and expects increased sales of lan products in many of the company s lan products utilize the raw material fluorinated ethylene propylene fep to produce flame retarding cables 
there are few worldwide producers of fep and market supplies of this product have been periodically limited over the past several years 
in  the company announced that it had developed a patent pending thin wall foam fep process that will use approximately less fep in typical product designs and improve signal velocity 
customer response to initial use of the new products has been positive  and the company expects to increase production of the new product designs during overall average selling prices for catv products for the full fiscal year decreased slightly from  but were generally more stable than in recent years 
overall average selling prices for lan products were stable for as compared to due to a stronger mix of enhanced cables  which provide higher unit prices than standard grade cables 
however  overall average selling prices for lan products were lower during the second half of the company has recently expanded into additional markets through the internal development of new products such as cell reach  which is a coaxial cable product designed to be installed on antenna towers for cellular telephone  personal communication services pcs  paging and other wireless or cellular communications applications 
initial marketing of cell reach cables and accessories as the lowest loss  lowest life cycle cost solution for wireless applications to cellular network operators in the united states and certain international markets began in sales of cell reach products represented approximately of total net sales in recent contracts with airgate wireless and sprint pcs  announced late in  confirm that the cell reach product is gaining industry recognition in the wireless and cellular market 
sales of other products increased by million in compared to included in these amounts are sales of wiring products used in telecommunication applications  cell reach product sales  and sales from the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business that was sold in february 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to gross profit of million 
gross profit margin was in and the decrease in gross profit is due to the lower sales volume in as compared to gross profit margin  while stable on a year to year basis  improved significantly throughout gross profit margins were for the first quarter of  for the second quarter of  for the third quarter of and for the fourth quarter of the gross profit margin improvement of almost basis points during the last three calendar quarters of is due primarily to the following factors o a stabilization of market prices for the company s coaxial cable products o engineered manufacturing efficiencies including value capture vertical integration o raw material cost improvements including costs for commodity raw materials o improving cell reach product profitability the company has focused intensely on developing or acquiring manufacturing capabilities that allow for the in house production or modification of materials and components used in the production of its finished products that are more efficient than commercially practiced 
as the company continues to capitalize on its competitive cost advantages by expanding the reach of its vertical integration projects  the overall cost of production is expected to improve 
the company currently has two key projects planned that should maintain its cost reduction momentum during the company s cell reach product generated negative gross profit margin during initial marketing and test installations in for  cell reach manufacturing start up costs negatively impacted gross profit margin by approximately basis points 
as cell reach has gained industry recognition during  product sales have increased and the product has produced positive gross profit margin in the company anticipates continued improvements in gross profit margins in due to the pricing and cost initiatives in place 
however  these improvements may be moderated by the implementation of a new factory information management system and the impact of the acquisition and transition of the coaxial cable business operations in seneffe  belgium 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in sg a expense is due primarily to expanded sales and marketing efforts for the company s products 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was in and in with the additional costs of the seneffe operations  the planned expansion of sales and marketing efforts  and the planned implementation of a new information management system planned during  sg a expense for is expected to increase from levels 
research and development expense was of net sales in both and other income expense  net other income  net was million in and other expense  net was million in other income  net includes a million benefit for the partial reversal of pretax charges related to the company s financial investment in an australian joint venture and a one time gain from the sale of its high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business of million 
other expense  net in primarily reflects pretax charges of million to reduce the company s total current financial investment in an australian joint venture to expected net realizable value 
due to certain governmental regulation changes and other events affecting the market for cable products in australia during  manufacturing operations of the joint venture were suspended in august and formally discontinued by decision of the joint venture s directors in december during the fourth quarter of  commscope recorded pretax charges of million to other expense to reduce its total current financial investment in the joint venture to expected net realizable value 
tax benefits were recorded at the company s effective tax rate reduced by a million valuation allowance established for expected non deductible capital losses resulting from the investment 
net of tax benefits of million  these charges reduced net income by million per share 
in july  a formal termination and dissolution agreement for the joint venture was completed 
the liquidation of the joint venture s assets in  which was impacted by the terms of the formal termination and dissolution agreement between the partners  resulted in improved expectations for the financial position of the joint venture at final dissolution than was anticipated at december accordingly  million of the pretax charges related to the company s financial investment in the joint venture were reversed into other income per share after taxes  including reversal of the capital loss valuation allowance established in 
net interest expense and income taxes net interest expense was million in compared to million in on a pro forma basis giving effect to the distribution as if it had occurred on january   net interest expense was million in the reduction in net interest expense in compared to pro forma net interest expense in is attributable to an million reduction in borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility in and a total reduction of million from the distribution date to december  
the company s effective tax rate in was representing a normal effective tax rate reduced primarily by the effects of the change in a capital loss valuation allowance of 
the company s effective tax rate in was representing a normal effective tax rate increased by for the establishment of a capital loss valuation allowance 
the capital loss valuation allowance established in relates to expected non deductible capital losses resulting from the company s equity investment in an australian joint venture 
the basis point reduction in the normal effective tax rate for compared to is due to increased tax benefits from foreign sales and the utilization of state investment tax credits 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million compared to million in  an increase of 
the following table presents the company s revenues in millions by product line and domestic versus international sales for the years ended december  and  respectively net of net of sales net sales sales net sales catv products lan products other products total domestic sales international sales total sales of catv products in were essentially equal to levels 
domestically  sales of catv products were primarily to multiple system operators using hfc networks  who continued their upgrading activities 
excluding sales to our largest domestic customer  sales to domestic multiple system operators increased by approximately in as compared to these domestic sales increases were mostly offset by lower sales volume to the company s largest customer in international sales of catv products  which represent most of the company s international sales activity  were also equal to international sales levels 
excluding sales to asia and the pacific rim market  international sales increased approximately in compared to however  sales to the pacific rim region decreased by million primarily as a result of economic conditions in the region and changes in the australian market due to certain governmental regulation changes and other events affecting the market for cable products in that country 
catv product sales to australia were million in  a decrease of million from sales of million 
sales of lan products increased in compared to  primarily due to higher sales volume for premise wiring of local area networks 
the higher sales volumes of lan products has been achieved through the expansion of manufacturing capacity and facilities dedicated to these products  the introduction of cable products with enhanced electrical and physical performance and the acquisition of lan product lines from teledyne industries  inc in may average selling prices for both catv products and lan products were lower in compared to  primarily attributable to competitive price reductions in the market for these products  and offset favorable unit sales volume growth for most products 
sales of other products  which increased million in compared to  primarily represent sales from the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business  acquired along with certain other assets primarily used in the production of certain lan products  from teledyne industries  inc in may sales from the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business which was sold in february were million in and million in subsequent to the acquisition  representing million of the increase in sales of other products for other sales  primarily of wiring products used in telecommunication applications  were million in compared to million in sales of cell reach products  included in other sales  were less than of net sales in both and gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to gross profit of million 
gross profit margin was in and in the decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin were due to market price competition  higher raw material costs  low gross profit margin in the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business  and negative gross profits generated during the introduction phase of the cell reach product 
during  particularly in the third and fourth quarters  the company made significant progress in the introduction of the cell reach product 
more than cellular and pcs sites were successfully installed and began operation of cell reach products  including customers such as nextel  bellsouth  sprint and air touch 
for  cell reach manufacturing start up costs negatively impacted gross profit margin by approximately basis points 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in sg a expense is due primarily to expanded sales and marketing efforts for the company s products  particularly for growth opportunities in international cable and network markets  and the development of a sales force to support the sale of cell reach products 
general and administrative expenditures related to the distribution also contributed slightly to the overall increase in sg a expense 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense was in and in research and development expense was of net sales in both and other income expense  net other expense  net was million in and other income  net was million in other expense  net in primarily reflects pretax charges of million to reduce its total current financial investment in an australian joint venture to expected net realizable value 
other income  net in primarily reflects the company s share of income generated by its investment in the australian joint venture acquired in august net interest expense and income taxes net interest expense  as recorded in the consolidated statements of income  was million in compared to million in on a pro forma basis giving effect to the distribution as if it had occurred on january   net interest expense was million in compared to million in pro forma interest expense was computed using an assumed weighted average borrowing rate of plus the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with borrowings initially outstanding under the company s credit facilities at the distribution date 
the reduction in pro forma net interest expense in compared to is attributable to an million reduction in borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility from the distribution date to december the provision for income taxes has been determined as if the company had filed separate tax returns under its existing structure for the periods presented prior to the distribution 
the company s effective tax rate was in representing a normal effective tax rate increased by for the establishment of a valuation allowance related to expected non deductible capital losses resulting from the company s equity investment in an australian joint venture and in cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by operating activities primarily represents net income plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and changes in deferred income taxes  adjusted for the change in working capital 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the company invested million in  million in and million in to acquire equipment and facilities in support of capacity expansion across the business units to meet increased current and anticipated future demands for commscope products 
cash proceeds from the sale of assets of the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business in totaled million 
in the company utilized million to acquire the high temperature aerospace and industrial cable business  along with certain other assets primarily used in the production of certain lan products  from teledyne industries  inc planned capital expenditures for equipment and facilities during are million  and will be impacted by the pace of spending for vertical integration activities 
cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  the company made net repayments of million of amounts borrowed under its revolving credit facility 
the company received cash proceeds of million from the issuance of stock in a secondary public offering completed primarily for the sale of existing shares of stock held by partnerships associated with forstmann little co 
and cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options during of million 
on july  the company entered into an unsecured million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks the credit agreement 
on the distribution date  the company initially borrowed million under the credit agreement 
the initial borrowings were utilized to make a dividend payment to general instrument of million in accordance with the terms of the distribution and to fund debt issuance costs of the credit agreement exceeding million 
from the distribution date to december   net repayments of initial borrowings under the credit agreement totaled million 
prior to the distribution  the company participated in the general instrument cash management program 
to the extent the company generated positive cash  such amounts were remitted to general instrument 
to the extent the company experienced temporary cash needs for working capital purposes or capital expenditures  such funds historically were provided by general instrument 
net transfers to general instrument were million in and million in the company established an independent cash management program on the distribution date to support future business levels and growth objectives 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at december  compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital of million is primarily the result of a million reduction in inventory levels 
the increase in working capital of million is primarily the result of million in cash and cash equivalents retained by the company under its independent cash management program at december  based on current levels of orders and backlog  management of the company believes that working capital levels are appropriate to support future operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that future industry specific developments or general economic trends will not alter the company s working capital requirements 
currently  the company s primary source of funds for general working capital needs  financing capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes is the million credit agreement  of which million in borrowings are outstanding at december  interest on outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement is generally payable quarterly in arrears  and all amounts borrowed are due on december  the credit agreement contains certain financial and operating covenants  which are described more fully in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company was in compliance with these loan covenants at december  the weighted average variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings and associated credit fees under long term debt facilities at december  was 
the company utilizes the credit agreement for  among other things  general working capital needs  financing capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that the company will have sufficient access to the capital markets to obtain financial resources of a short and long term nature on acceptable terms as may be needed to fund operations  capital expenditures and other growth objectives to the extent not provided by cash flows from operations 
the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in the ratio was primarily due to net repayments of borrowings under the company s credit agreement of million  net income for  and million in proceeds from the issuance of stock in the secondary offering 
risk management in the normal course of business  commscope is exposed to the risk of loss from non performance by its customers under outstanding extensions of credit accounts receivable 
the company controls exposures to credit risk associated with these financial instruments through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
at december   in management s opinion  commscope did not have any significant exposure to any individual customer or counter party  nor did commscope have any significant concentration of credit risk related to any financial instrument 
commscope is exposed to market risk from changes in commodity raw material prices  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and increases in interest rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
commscope manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
many of the raw materials utilized in the company s manufacturing operations are commodity products that are openly traded on exchange markets  and are subject to significant changes in market prices 
changes in the prices of commodity raw materials used by the company could result in higher overall production costs  thereby negatively impacting the company s gross profit margin 
as of december   the company had entered into a commodity price swap agreement to effectively lock in a fixed price for a portion of its third quarter aluminum purchases 
the total value of aluminum covered by the commodity price swap agreement in place at december  equates to less than of the company s average quarterly cost of sales 
as of december  the company had not entered into any derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to changes in the market prices of commodity products 
the company primarily bills customers in foreign countries in us dollars 
however  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar can adversely affect product sales in those regions because commscope products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
the company had not entered into any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exchange rates at december  or the company s primary source of funds currently other than cash flows from operations is borrowings available under the million credit agreement 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement incur interest at variable rates that are based on an underlying market rate such as libor or the prime rate 
the interest term for individual borrowings under the credit agreement cannot exceed six months  at which time the underlying market rate of the individually outstanding borrowings is reset to the current market rates 
as of december   the company had entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert an aggregate amount of million of variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate basis 
contracts for notional amounts of million each expire in april and october  respectively 
under the agreements  interest settlement payments will be made quarterly based upon the spread between the three month libor  as adjusted quarterly  and fixed rates of and  respectively 
net payments or receipts resulting from the interest rate swap agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in each quarter 
the company had similar interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  the fair value of the company s commodity price and interest rate swap agreements was not material to the company s financial position at december  or effects of inflation the company continually attempts to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling its operating costs and selling prices 
during the past few years  the rate of inflation has been low and has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the principal raw materials purchased by commscope fabricated aluminum  plastics  bi metals  copper and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to the commodity markets 
to the extent that commscope is unable to pass on cost increases to customers  the cost increases could have a significant impact on the results of operations of commscope 
other commscope is either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  management believes none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial statements upon final disposition 
in addition  commscope is subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials 
the company s manufacturing facilities are believed to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
impact of newly issued accounting standards the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  on january  comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders equity exclusive of transactions with owners 
examples of items to be reported as other comprehensive income include unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  translation adjustments on investments in consolidated foreign subsidiaries and certain changes in minimum pension liabilities 
there were no transactions representing other comprehensive income during the years ended december   or comprehensive income will also include gains and losses on certain derivative transactions that qualify as hedges  as computed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was issued in june and will be adopted by the company on january  sfas no 
requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes special accounting standards for derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations 
management is evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the company s financial position and operations 
european monetary union euro on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro trades on currency exchanges 
the legacy currencies of the participating countries will remain legal tender for a transition period between january  and january  the company conducts business in member countries 
during the transition period  cash less payments for example  wire transfers can be made in the euro  and parties to individual transactions can elect to pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and eventually withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
the company is addressing the issues involved with the introduction of the euro 
among the issues facing the company are the assessment and conversion of information technology it systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
in addition  the company is reviewing certain existing contracts for potential modification and assessing its pricing marketing strategies in the affected european markets 
based on current information  commscope does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
year commscope is currently addressing an issue common to most companies ensuring that its existing it systems and applications and other non it control devices are suitable for continued use into and beyond the year many it systems and applications and non it control devices utilized by the company use only two digits to identify a year in the date field and accordingly may recognize a date using as the year or some other date rather than the year failure to make appropriate modifications or upgrades to critical it systems and applications and non it control devices could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing significant disruptions to operations 
third parties with whom the company interacts also employ various computer systems with similar year compliance issues 
failure by third parties to adequately address their own year compliance issues exposes the company to business risks such as a reduced demand for the company s products or the lack of availability of critical raw materials or services required for manufacturing the company s products 
the company s products themselves high performance  high bandwidth cables for the telecommunications industry are not affected by the year problem 
the year compliance discussion below is based on information currently available to the company 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year section should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
to address the year compliance issue  the company has appointed a corporate wide year compliance project team which is responsible for coordinating the identification  evaluation  and implementation of changes to it systems and applications and non it control devices necessary to achieve a year date conversion 
the year compliance project team is also investigating significant third parties to determine the effectiveness of their efforts toward achieving year compliance 
the year compliance project team has designed a systematic methodology of addressing the year compliance issue  which includes identification and evaluation of it systems and applications and non it control devices with year compliance issues  implementation of changes to it systems and applications and non it control devices to achieve year compliance  testing of the corrective actions taken to ensure year compliance for the identified systems  and development of contingency plans in the event of the failure of third parties to become year compliant 
a database of internal it systems and applications and non it control devices which rely on date sensitive computer logic has been developed to provide a starting framework from which to address the significant issues related to year compliance 
each of these systems  applications and devices is being classified as a priority a  b  or c issue 
both a and b priority items are deemed as critical systems which must be modified or upgraded into year compliance 
priority c items are non critical it and non it systems which will be upgraded into year compliance upon completion of the modification of a and b priority items 
the year compliance project team has also accumulated a database of significant third parties 
each of these third parties is being contacted and asked to provide responses which will allow the company to assess their ability to achieve year compliance 
the company will also evaluate third party compliance through internal testing  where feasible  to verify that the modifications are effective 
almost all of the company s suppliers are still engaged in executing their year compliance efforts 
as a result  the company at this time cannot fully evaluate the year risks to its supply of goods and services 
the company maintains a list of alternative suppliers as part of its contingency plan in the event current suppliers do not timely complete their compliance efforts 
however  because there are limited sources of certain materials used in manufacturing the company s products  the company may not be able to develop an alternative source of supply if the operations of its current suppliers are interrupted as a result of year non compliance 
commscope will continue to monitor the year status of its suppliers to minimize this risk and will develop or modify  as appropriate  contingency plans as the risks become more clear 
modifications to most written programs for it systems and applications which initially were developed in house have been in progress by company personnel since early in addition  certain non compliant systems and applications have been or are being replaced with year compliant systems and products 
substantially all it systems and applications acquired from external sources are being upgraded to year compliant versions if they are not already through system upgrades or through the purchase of new systems 
the company believes that it has achieved year compliance for critical internal it systems and applications at december   with year compliance expected by the third quarter of virtually all the critical non it systems including a variety of equipment control devices are currently being identified  evaluated and modified  as appropriate  for year compliance through upgrades to year compliant devices 
the company plans to test the effectiveness of corrective actions taken to achieve year compliance during  but to date it has not performed compliance testing on systems or applications for which year modifications have been made 
as compliance testing is completed and a full assessment of the risks from potential year systems failures can be made  the company plans to develop year contingency plans for such risks 
these contingency plans will factor in business and operating decisions related to the potential failure of significant third parties to become year compliant 
the company currently does not believe that the costs of addressing year compliance issues will be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company estimates that  through december   it has spent  to address year compliance issues for it systems and applications and  for non it devices 
future expenditures to address year compliance issues are currently estimated at  for it systems and applications and  for non it devices 
the company expects to finance expenditures for year compliance modifications through cash flows from future operations 
due to the company s dependence upon  and its current uncertainty with  the year compliance of certain third party suppliers and vendors  the company is unable to determine at this time its most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company expects its year compliance efforts to reduce significantly the company s current level of uncertainty regarding the impact of these year issues 
the company believes that the corrective actions implemented under the direction of the year compliance project team will be completed on a timely basis in a cost effective manner to ensure that the company s internal systems will be operational and suitable for continued use in the year and beyond 
in addition  the company believes that significant third parties will become year compliant or that adequate contingency plans will be developed and implemented to ensure minimal business interruption to the company s operations 
however  there can be no guarantee that problems associated with system failure or deficient system operation due to year compliance issues will not result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
subsequent events effective january   the company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of alcatel s coaxial cable business in seneffe  belgium 
the acquisition provides the company with a european base of operations  access to established distribution channels and complementary coaxial cable technologies 
the operation in seneffe is the largest catv coaxial cable manufacturer in europe with annual sales by alcatel of approximately million in the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase business combination and  accordingly  the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition of approximately million 
payment for the acquired business will be financed primarily by borrowings under a new credit agreement for million euros approximately million entered into by the company in the first quarter of forward looking statements certain statements in this form k which are other than historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of  the private securities litigation reform act of and other related laws
