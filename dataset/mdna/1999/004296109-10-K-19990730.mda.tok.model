results of operations the company s revenues and operating results have varied substantially from period to period

the company records product revenue from packaged software and irrevocable commitments to purchase products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
as a result  product revenue in any period is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that period and on the receipt of irrevocable commitment license agreements 
product revenue is difficult to forecast due to the fact that the company s sales cycle  from initial trial to multiple copy licenses  varies substantially from customer to customer 
as a result  variations in the timing of product sales can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period

the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits rather than four to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
as a result  the company s primary customer base  large financial services organizations and government agencies  who are deeply affected by the year problem due to their reliance on computer systems  have focused their information technology resources on ensuring year readiness 
this has dramatically impacted the company s ability to sell enterprise wide licenses to these customers 
the company expects that the year issue will have a continuing impact on product sales for its fiscal year during the latter part of the fiscal year the company also experienced a shift of focus by its customers to internet based solutions from more traditional client server solutions and the emergence of new competitors selling pre packaged solutions 
the company has developed a comprehensive strategy to address both the market for internet based solutions and prepackaged applications which will be implemented in fiscal year however  there can be no assurance that revenue derived from this strategy will be sufficient to offset the potential decrease in revenue from the company s client server products

in addition  the amended agreement provided that the company may issue its common shares to delrina in satisfaction of a portion of its payment obligations provided that the total market value of the company s common shares held by delrina immediately following such issuance does not exceed us million and the company continues to meet certain registration requirements in respect of such issued common shares 
the company believes that delrina held no common shares of the company as at april  as at april   the next four scheduled  quarterly payments totaled us million 
financial instruments and credit facility the company has entered into a receivables purchase agreement with the royal bank of canada the bank 
under the agreement  the company has the option to sell certain accounts receivable on a recourse basis

the maximum amount of accounts receivable the company can sell under this agreement is us million or the canadian dollar equivalent thereof 
the bank is in the process of reviewing its policies regarding the purchase of accounts receivable with payment terms exceeding one year 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to purchase additional term accounts receivable under the current agreement 
as at april   the outstanding balance of accounts receivable sold under this agreement was approximately us million 
the company believes that none of the receivables sold are at risk of recourse 
the company has a committed million credit facility with the royal bank of canada 
the credit facility is made up of i a million term facility which bears interest at a rate of over the bankers acceptance rate of the bank from time to time and is payable on june   and ii a million revolving line of credit which bears interest at the prime rate of the canadian bank from time to time 
as at april   the company had drawn down million of the term loan facility and locked in the interest rate until october  at 
the company had no borrowings against its revolving line of credit as at april  the company has granted as collateral for the million credit facility a general security agreement over jetform s assets  including a pledge of the shares of certain subsidiaries 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its ability to pay the obligation to delrina through the issuance of common shares  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s business requirements in the near term 
however  should the company continue to incur operating losses  its ability to meet its liquidity requirements and to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing may be compromised 
recent accounting pronouncements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october and amended by sop issued in march additionally  sop issued in december extends certain provisions of sop and amends certain provisions of sop sop will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending april the company is currently studying the impact  if any  of the adoption of sop on its future results of operations and financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
which delays the effective date of sfas until fiscal years beginning after june  although the impact of sfas on the company s financial disclosures is not known at this time  the company will adopt sfas during the year ending april  in april   the aicpa issued sop  reporting costs of start up activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for start up costs and organization costs 
this sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sop in its fiscal year ending april  the year what is commonly known as the year issue arises because many computerized systems use two digits rather than four to identify a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or some other date  resulting in errors when information using year dates is processed 
the effect of the year issue may be experienced before  on  or after january   and  if not addressed  the impact on operations and financial reporting may range from minor errors to significant systems failure which could affect an entity s ability to conduct normal business operations 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by software failures caused by the advent of the year to address the year issues  the company commenced a program which entailed a comprehensive review of its software products  internal financial and operational systems  and the company s suppliers 
the company has reviewed all its major products and believes that the majority of the current versions are year compliant 
certain products which are not currently year compliant are in the process of being upgraded to include year compliance 
the company has made available information on its year product compliance on its web site http www 
jetform 
com 
with respect to the company s internal systems  the company has identified internal hardware and software systems that could be affected by the year date change 
the company is taking preventive measures in those cases where systems have been found not to be year compliant either by replacing those systems or upgrading to compliant versions offered by suppliers 
all costs associated with modifying the existing internal use computer software will be expensed as incurred 
the company is contacting its major suppliers and is not aware of any year compliance issues that would impact its normal business operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of its major suppliers and other service providers on which the company relies will not be adversely impacted by software failures caused by the advent of the year the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address the year issues with respect to its products and internal systems and does not believe that the cost of such actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  the risks from the inability of the company s software products or internal systems to properly function in the year could result in increased warranty costs  customer satisfaction issues  inability to ship products  potential lawsuits  and other costs and liabilities resulting from business interruptions 
to the extent possible  the company will be developing contingency plans designed to allow continued operation in the event of failure of the company s or third parties systems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to its investment portfolio and its credit facility with its bank 
the company primarily invests its cash in short term high quality securities with reputable financial institutions 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations which management believes would not have a material impact on the financial position of the company 
the company has a committed million credit facility with the royal bank of canada 
the credit facility is made up of i a million term facility which bears interest at a rate of over the bankers acceptance rate of the bank from time to time and is payable on june   and ii a million revolving line of credit which bears interest at the prime rate of the canadian bank from time to time 
as at april   the company had drawn down million of the term loan facility and locked in the interest rate until october  at 
the company had no borrowings against its revolving line of credit as at april  the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended april  would have been approximately  foreign currency risk the company has net monetary asset and liability balances in foreign currencies other than the canadian dollar  including the us dollar us  the pound sterling gbp  the australian dollar aud  the swedish krona sek  the german mark dm  the french franc ff  the irish punt iep  the euro eur  and the japanese yen jpy 
jetform hedges its us dollar net asset position to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations 
gains and losses resulting from these hedges are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying position jetform does not enter into these financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
as at april   jetform had a forward contract outstanding to sell million us dollars at per canadian dollar 
as at april   the approximate fair value of this forward contract is nil 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in canadian and us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar will have an impact on the company s reported cash position 
as at april   a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would have reduced the company s reported cash and cash equivalents balance by approximately million 
as at april   a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus currencies other than the us dollar  held by the company  would not have had a material impact on the company s reported cash and cash equivalents balance
