in addition  the operating performance of prologis two unconsolidated subsidiaries  frigoscandia ab and csi  that are engaged in the refrigerated logistics business also effect prologis operating results 
prologis target market cities and submarkets have benefited substantially in recent periods from demographic trends including population and job growth which influence the demand for distribution facilities 
prologis believes its ability to compete is significantly enhanced relative to other companies due to its depth of management and its ability to serve customers through the prologis operating system tm  which includes acquisition  development  property management personnel and presence in local markets

acquisition activities entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations and that analysis with respect to the cost of improvement to bring an acquired project up to standards will prove inaccurate  as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
although prologis undertakes a thorough evaluation of the physical condition of each proposed investment before it is acquired  certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after it is acquired  which could increase prologis total acquisition cost

the following table summarizes the activity in interest rate contracts for the years ended december  and in millions interest rate interest rate futures contracts swaps notional amount as of december  new contracts matured or expired contracts terminated contracts notional amount as of december  new contracts matured or expired contracts terminated contracts notional amount as of december  in october  in anticipation of debt offerings in  prologis entered into two interest rate protection agreements which have been renewed past the original termination dates 
these agreements were entered into by prologis to fix the interest rate on anticipated financings 
during the third quarter of  prologis determined that the interest rate protection agreements would no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment under gaap based upon the following 
due to changing conditions in the public debt markets  it was no longer considered probable that prologis would complete the anticipated longer term debt offerings that prompted prologis to enter into these interest rate protection agreements in ie  prologis would not be exposed to the interest rate risk that these instruments were intended to hedge  and 
prologis determined  through internal analysis and through communications with independent third parties  that a high degree of correlation no longer existed between changes in the market values of these interest rate protection agreements and the market values of the anticipated debt offerings ie  the interest rate at which the debt could be issued by prologis under existing market conditions 
accordingly  prologis began marking these agreements to market as of september  for  prologis recognized a non cash expense of million

the second facility  in the amount of million french francs of which million french francs was outstanding as of december   is secured by the real estate owned by garonor sa prologis has guaranteed million french francs of the amount outstanding as of december  million as of december  
garonor has the ability to borrow an additional million french francs under this facility of which prologis will guarantee million french francs 
the total guaranty of million french francs can be reduced as garonor sa meets certain operating covenants 
distribution and dividend requirements prologis current distribution policy is to pay quarterly distributions to shareholders based upon what it considers to be a reasonable percentage of cash flow and at the level that will allow prologis to continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow typically will be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  annual distributions are expected to be consistently higher than annual earnings

funds from operations funds from operations attributable to common shares increased million to million for from million for funds from operation attributable to common shares increased million from to funds from operations represent prologis net earnings computed in accordance with gaap before minority interest  before gains or losses from debt restructuring  before gains or losses on disposition of depreciated real estate  before gains or losses from mark to market adjustments resulting from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of intercompany and other debt of prologis foreign subsidiaries  before deferred tax benefits and deferred tax expenses of prologis taxable subsidiaries  before significant non recurring items that materially distort the comparative measurement of company performance over time  plus real estate depreciation and amortization exclusive of amortization of loan costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated subsidiaries calculated to compute their funds from operations on the same basis as prologis 
prologis believes that funds from operations is helpful to a reader as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  it provides a reader with an indication of the ability of prologis to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the funds from operations measure presented by prologis  while comparable to the national association of real estate investment trusts definition  will not be comparable to similarly titled measure of other reits that do not compute funds from operations in a manner consistent with prologis 
funds from operations is not intended to represent cash made available to shareholders 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of prologis operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity

year overview the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
certain computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
prologis has undertaken a review of all of its computer systems and applications to determine if these programs are year compliant and if not  the efforts that will be necessary to bring the programs into compliance 
prologis has not identified any computer system or application that  upon failure to be year compliant  would have a material adverse impact on its business or results of operations 
information technology systems prologis information technology it environment is primarily a microsoft windows based personal computer network nt or novell utilizing desktop applications  primarily data base and spreadsheet applications 
additionally  prologis utilizes third party developed software  including accounting and property management systems 
prologis critical computer hardware  operating systems and key general accounting  property management and financial reporting applications are year compliant  as verified by the various vendors 
prologis has identified one accounting application that is not year compliant 
because prologis has undertaken to replace its core financial systems with computer software that will better serve its future needs such software is year compliant  it is not expected that the non compliant accounting application will continue to be used by prologis after mid should the enterprise wide implementation of the new computer software not be accomplished in a timely manner and the non compliant accounting application is still in use at the end of  prologis has two contingency plans 
the first option is to install a year compliant version of the current software that the vendor has indicated will be available in secondly  prologis can  with minimal efforts  convert this application to the year compliant software currently in use for all other accounting applications 
should neither contingency plan be successfully implemented  prologis could experience a delay in reporting its financial results and also delays in processing payments to vendors beginning with the first quarter of also  additional costs would be incurred to perform this function manually until such time as the computer application is made year complaint 
non it systems many of prologis operating facilities have microchips embedded in the building operating systems 
prologis  as owner and lessor of these buildings  has assessed its exposure with respect to year related failures in these operating systems 
these building operating systems include programmable thermostats  security systems  communications systems  utility monitoring systems and timed locks 
under the terms of substantially all of prologis building leases  the tenant has responsibility for the operating systems within their leased space  including the responsibility for addressing the year compliance of those systems 
however  prologis is responsible for the operating systems that control the common exterior areas of the buildings  including parking lot lighting and sprinkler systems 
generally  these systems are programmed on daily or weekly cycles as opposed to calendar based programming 
consequently  the risk of a year related malfunction is extremely low and any such malfunction would not have a material impact on prologis operations 
prologis is also responsible for the fire and life safety monitoring systems in its buildings 
prologis contracts with a third party to monitor these systems 
these systems are not calendar based  because reportable events are identified as they occur 
consequently  the risk of a year related failure is low 
prologis is currently conducting a review of all operating systems that fall within its responsibility 
preliminary results have indicated that prologis primary vendor for monitoring of fire and life safety systems has verified that their system is year compliant 
prologis is continuing its review of other systems and is performing testing and verification as deemed appropriate 
this process is expected to be completed during the second quarter of based upon the results of this review  prologis will formulate a contingency plan to address risk areas identified  if any 
should the systems that prologis is responsible for fail  prologis tenants may experience inconveniences with respect to the maintenance and operations of the facilities ie  parking lot lighting and sprinkler systems 
should the fire and life safety systems fail  there could be a delay in identifying a reportable event or a reportable event could occur without being identified 
in such situations  prologis could be exposed to the extent the failure resulted in a loss that is not covered by existing insurance policies 
third parties management believes that its planning efforts are adequate to address the year issue and that its risk factors are primarily those that it cannot directly control  including the readiness of financial institutions and utility providers 
failure on the part of these entities to become year compliant could result in disruptions in the business operations of prologis 
costs prologis activities with respect to its assessment of year compliance and its remediation efforts are being performed by existing personnel 
prologis has not obtained a cost estimate for upgrading the accounting application referred to above  as the need for this contingency plan is not considered probable at this time 
prologis historical costs for addressing the year issue are not material and management does not anticipate that its future costs associated with the year issue will be material 
third party costs and interim software solutions for year issues have been less than  and are not expected to exceed  prologis does not separately track the internal costs incurred for year compliance issues 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs of its it group 
although the cost of replacing prologis key it systems is substantial  the replacements have been and are being made to improve operational efficiency and were not accelerated due to the year issue 
prologis has not delayed any material projects as a result of the year issue 
funds expended to address year issues have been made from operating cash flow 
unconsolidated subsidiaries as part of its compliance program  management of prologis has received ongoing reports from csi  frigoscandia ab  prologis kingspark and garonor sa on the impact of the year problem on their operations and financial results 
csi has completed testing on all it and embedded operating systems 
no critical it or embedded operating systems have been identified that have not already been remediated or are not year compliant 
csi is currently verifying and testing customer and supplier electronic data interface programming standards 
csi has retained an outside consulting firm to review their internal testing results 
the consultants review is expected to be completed during the second quarter of csi estimates that the total cost incurred to date and the total cost to be incurred for year remediation is less than  failure of csi to procure payroll processing services that are year compliant could result in a delay in paying its employees 
also  additional costs would be incurred to perform this function manually 
frigoscandia ab has substantially completed all testing of its it and embedded operating systems 
no critical it or embedded operating systems have been identified that have not already been remediated  with the exception of the financial reporting application for its french and spanish operations and certain components of an inventory management system 
a new financial reporting system for the french and spanish operations is being implemented and is expected to be fully operational by may modifications to the components of the inventory management system will be completed by the second quarter of frigoscandia ab is currently planning a coordinated program whereby testing with key customers and critical suppliers is performed 
additionally  frigoscandia ab is preparing detailed contingency plans in the event of unexpected year disruptions 
frigoscandia ab estimates that the total cost incurred to date and the estimated total cost to be incurred for year remediation is between million and million 
failure of frigoscandia ab to convert the financial reporting application for its french operations to a year compliant system could result in delays in reporting financial results beginning with the first quarter of and also delays in billings to customers and in payments to vendors 
these delays could result in additional costs to frigoscandia ab 
also  additional costs would be incurred by frigoscandia ab to perform these functions manually 
the primary accounting applications of prologis kingspark are not year compliant 
to remediate this problem  prologis kingspark is currently installing a year compliant version of non customized accounting software 
installation and testing is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of prologis kingspark has virtually no risk associated with embedded operating systems because substantially all of prologis kingspark s activities are related to development of facilities for third parties and not for its own long term ownership 
prologis kingspark estimates that the total cost incurred to date and the estimated total cost to be incurred for the year remediation is less than  failure of prologis kingspark to convert its primary accounting applications to a year compliant system could result in delays in reporting financial results beginning with the first quarter of and also delays in billings to customers and in payments to vendors 
these delays could result in additional costs to prologis kingspark 
also  additional costs would be incurred by prologis kingspark to perform these functions manually 
garonor sa has completed testing on all it and embedded operating systems 
garonor sa plans to install a year compliant version of its current financial accounting software by the end of the second quarter of garonor sa s customer billing and cash management software are also not year compliant 
garonor sa is in the process of replacing these software applications and expects the new software will be in place prior to the fourth quarter of costs to bring these applications into compliance are expected to be less than  should the new software applications not be successfully implemented  garonor sa could experience a delay in reporting its financial results and also delays in processing billings to customers and in payments to vendors 
these delays could result in additional costs to garonor sa also  additional costs would be incurred by garonor sa to perform these functions manually 
garonor sa s responsibility for the operating systems that control the interior equipment  common exterior areas and the fire and life safety systems of its buildings is similar to that of prologis  as discussed above under non it systems 
garonor sa has tested these systems and determined that they are year compliant 
in addition  garonor sa has received an indemnification from the vendors who supplied these systems with respect to any year failures 
there can be no assurances that year remediation efforts by prologis  its unconsolidated subsidiaries or third parties will be properly and timely completed  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on prologis  its business and its financial condition 
prologis cannot predict the actual effects to it of the year problem  which depends on numerous uncertainties such as i whether significant third parties properly and timely address the year issue  and  ii whether broad based or systemic economic failures may occur 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year  prologis is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on its operations 
prologis year compliance program is expected to significantly reduce the level of uncertainty about the year impact in areas that are within its direct control and management of prologis believes that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk prologis interest rate risk is related primarily to its variable rate credit facilities 
prologis interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objective  prologis borrows on a long term basis primarily at fixed rates and staggered maturities with its primary interest rate risk being related to its variable rate unsecured lines of credit and its variable rate short term borrowing arrangement 
prologis has in the past and intends in the future  to occasionally utilize derivative financial instruments as hedges in anticipation of future long term debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk exposure 
prologis does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
prologis had a million interest rate futures contract and a million interest rate swap agreement as of december  these interest rate protection agreements were marked to market as of december  and prologis recognized an expense related to these agreements of million in these agreements were terminated in february at a cost of million  with respect to the unsecured lines of credit and with respect to the short term borrowings 
during the year ended december   prologis had weighted average outstanding borrowings of million on its variable rate unsecured lines of credit and million on its variable rate short term borrowing arrangement 
if interest rates had been higher during  interest expense on prologis variable rate borrowings would have increased by approximately million 
foreign currency risk prologis is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily to the extent prologis has made intercompany loans to its foreign subsidiaries that are not denominated in us dollars 
prologis has made such loans in the functional currency of certain of its subsidiaries  the proceeds of which have been used primarily to acquire and develop distribution facilities in each country 
for financial reporting purposes  prologis recognized a remeasurement gain on its intercompany loans that are not us dollar denominated based upon foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of december  of million for the year ended december  had the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which prologis has made such loans moved unfavorably against the us dollar by  prologis would have recognized an additional remeasurement loss of approximately million
