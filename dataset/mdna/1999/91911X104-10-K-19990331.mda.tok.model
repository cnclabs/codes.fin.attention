this action  based on a decision by the ministry for economic and property transformation that was reached on november   effectively reduced the company s equity ownership of icn yugoslavia from to 
the ministry of economic and property transformation decision was based on a unilaterally imposed recalculation of the company s original capital contribution to icn yugoslavia 
subsequent to the seizure  the commercial court of belgrade issued an order stating that a change in control had occurred 
these actions were taken  contrary to yugoslavian law  without any notification to or representation by the company 
since the change of control  representatives of the company and icn yugoslavia s management have been denied access to the premises and any representation as to the management of icn yugoslavia 
as a result of the yugoslavian government s actions  the company recorded a charge of  in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the write off of all of the company s investment in icn yugoslavia and related assets

as a result of the decline in the ruble exchange rate  the company recorded foreign exchange losses of  related to its russian operations during subsequent to december   the value of the ruble has continued to decline in relation to the dollar  exceeding rubles to the company believes that the economic crisis in russia has adversely affected the pharmaceutical industry in the region 
many russian companies  including many of the company s customers  continue to experience severe liquidity shortages as rubles are in short supply  and russian companies hard currency assets remain frozen in russian banks 
this liquidity crisis has diminished many russian companies ability to pay their debts and is likely to lead to a number of business failures in the region

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  foreign operations approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and were generated from operations outside the united states 
all of the company s foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  political instability and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the effect of these risks remains difficult to predict 
icn russia operates in a highly inflationary economy and uses the dollar as the functional currency rather than the russian ruble 
during the three year period ended december   the cumulative rate of inflation was approximately 
all foreign exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations are included in income 
as of december   icn russia had a net monetary asset position of approximately  which would be subject to foreign exchange loss if a further decline in the value of the ruble in relation to the dollar were to occur 
due to the extremely large fluctuation in the ruble exchange rate  the ultimate amount of any future foreign exchange loss the company may incur cannot presently be determined and such loss may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s management continues to work to reduce its net monetary exposure  including the tightening of credit policies and increased accounts receivable collection efforts including  in some cases  discounts for early payment from customers 
however  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
the company does not currently provide any hedges on its foreign currency exposure and  in certain countries in which the company operates  no effective hedging programs are available 
the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to foreign currency risk on its foreign denominated debt of approximately  at december   which is primarily denominated in swiss francs and german marks and  at hungary and poland  in us dollars 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  for further discussion 
inflation and changing prices the effects of inflation are experienced by the company through increases in the costs of labor  services and raw materials 
the company is subject to price control restrictions on its pharmaceutical products in the majority of countries in which it operates 
while the company attempts to raise selling prices in anticipation of inflation  the company has been affected by the lag in allowed price increases in yugoslavia and mexico  which has created lower sales in us dollars and reductions in gross profit

the year issue many computer systems and equipment and instruments with embedded microprocessors were designed to recognize only the last two digits of a calendar year 
with the arrival of the year  these systems and microprocessors may encounter operating problems due to their inability to distinguish years after from years preceding systems that are not year compliant could malfunction  potentially resulting in an adverse impact on the company s business 
the company is pursuing an action plan to be year compliant in all locations by the third quarter of the company does not have significant reliance on custom  internally generated software  the company principally uses third party software that is  in most cases  already year compliant 
the company has completed an assessment of its worldwide information systems and has determined that it will be required to perform some modification or replacement of software so that all systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company has spent approximately  to upgrade its information systems to be year compliant  and currently considers its information systems to be over year compliant 
the company recently converted its russian operations to year compliant software 
the remaining projects that must be completed for full year compliance are software upgrades at the company s plants in hungary and puerto rico 
the purchase of replacement software is necessary to maintain the existing good manufacturing practices status of these plants 
the company has acquired appropriate replacement software for these facilities and installation began early in the estimated additional cost to complete the conversion to full year compliance is estimated to be approximately  which will be spent primarily in and funded with cash from operations 
there can be no assurance that the conversion will be completed within internal or external deadlines 
the company s operations may also be impacted in the event that computer disruption is encountered by third parties with whom the company conducts significant business 
these third parties include suppliers and service providers on whom the company relies  and the wholesalers  distributors  health care providers  and others from whom the company derives its revenues 
the company has identified the most critical of these third parties and the company intends to communicate with these third parties concerning their state of readiness 
however  the company can provide no assurance that these third parties will not experience business disruption 
if a number of these third parties experience business disruption due to a year computer problem  the company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company is evaluating the need for contingency plans to address potential business disruptions at these third parties 
contingency planning may include increasing inventory levels  establishing secondary sources of supply and manufacturing  modifying production schedules  and maintaining backup lines of communications with our customers 
should the company determine that important third parties may experience business interruption  appropriate contingency plans will be developed 
however  it is unlikely that any contingency plan can fully mitigate the impact of significant business disruptions among these third parties
