ffo applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million or even with the amount reported for the year ended december  the average common shares outstanding during and were  and  respectively 
ffo contributed from existing mall operations before interest  general and administrative costs  and cash flow support was up million 
ffo contributed by the recently acquired properties  net of financing costs  was million 
these increases were partially offset by million full year impact of the preferred shares dividends net of amount allocated to acquired properties  and million higher general and administrative expenses  due mostly to higher costs in the leasing and acquisition departments 
after allocations to acquired properties  interest expense was down by million 
the million increase from existing properties resulted from a an increase in mall shop minimum and percentage rent of million  b an increase in anchor minimum and percentage rent of million  and c an increase in straight line rental income and miscellaneous revenues of million  offset by d an increase in property operating costs net of recoveries in the amount of million  primarily due to one time expense reductions in as a result of real estate tax and franchise tax credits due to settlements  and e lower temporary and promotional income in in the amount of million due to less space available due to the increase in permanent leasing 
year ended december  versus year ended december  ffo applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  total ffo before allocations to minority interests and preferred shareholders was million compared to million in ffo contributed from the company s core property operations ie  anchor and mall shop rents  percentage rents  straight line rents  operating costs net of tenant recoveries  temporary and seasonal leasing  and miscellaneous mall revenues increased million over the million improvement in property operations includes million from lower operating costs  net of tenant recoveries  million higher temporary and seasonal leasing income reflecting increased emphasis on this area to mitigate the lower mall shop occupancy  million higher straight line rental income  and million contributed from valley mall which was acquired in november  offset by million lower small shop base and percentage rents from lower average occupancy partially offset by higher average base rents  and million from lower anchor base and percentage rents due largely to higher anchor vacancies in other positive impacts on total ffo included a a decrease in net interest costs of million of which million is the effect of the paydown of debt and increased short term investments associated with the july preferred share offering offset by million higher interest from increased borrowings and less capitalized interest  mainly related to the logan valley mall reconstruction  and b an increase in cash flow support see note by million

c ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization the computation of ebitda is shown below for the years ended december    and december  total revenues    add back operating covenant amortization deducted in minimum rent    net    less recoverable costs and expenses    less non recoverable costs and expenses    less property general administrative costs    less corporate general administrative costs    add back depreciation amortization in above expenses lines and joint venture depreciation    gain on outparcel land sales    ebitda  as reported    year ended december  versus year ended december  total ebitda for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from s ebitda of million 
of this total increase  million was attributable to the recently acquired properties and million came from existing properties  the sale of middletown mall produced a decrease in ebitda of million 
year ended december  versus year ended december  total ebitda for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from s million 
the principal factors impacting ebitda in were a million lower lease buyout income  b million lower business interruption income from the fire at logan valley mall  c million lower gain on land sales  offset by d million lower net property operating costs and administrative costs 
d property operating results and trends aggregate tenant sales volume over the long term  the level of anchor and mall shop tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the company as anchor and mall shop tenants provide over of total revenues and because tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of tenant sales are considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
total reported sales for all tenants that reported sales for the applicable years are shown below in millions anchors owned locations    mall shop tenants  excluding freestanding  theater  and supermarkets the above data excludes sales from all seasonal and temporary tenants who generally do not report their sales to the company 
the company owned of anchor store locations at december  in a period of rapidly increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of declining sales  rents on new leases tend to grow more slowly 
however  revenues generally increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average base rents per square foot for mall shop tenants at quarter end for the last three years are shown in the following table 
the increase in average base rent during these three years results primarily from renewing existing leases at higher base rents  from leasing vacant space at higher base rents  and from elimination of lower paying tenants that closed during these periods 
march june september december comparable mall store sales and occupancy cost management believes that over long periods of time the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall shop tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs base fixed rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance and other costs pertaining to the property that they can afford to pay and still be profitable is a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
while such increased occupancy costs as a percentage of sales cannot grow indefinitely for any one tenant  management believes that it is possible to increase the percentage paid by all tenants as a group by aggressively working to replace under performing tenants with better performing ones 
comparable mall store sales per square foot in each reporting period is based on sales reported by mall store tenants excludes anchors and certain other large space users that occupied space in both the current and immediately preceding reporting period 
comparable mall store sales per square foot for the last three years are set out below 
also shown below is the percentage of mall shop tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of their annual sales 
comparable mall store sales per square foot occupancy cost percentage at period end seasonality and occupancy the enclosed shopping mall industry is seasonal in nature  with anchor and mall shop tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and expense recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  many leases are scheduled to expire in the first calendar quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
the aggregate mall shop occupancy percentage  defined as the ratio of total mall shop space that is leased including both tenants occupying space and tenants that have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy to the total mall shop space gross leasable area gla at quarter end for the last three years is set out below 
mall shop occupancy march june september december the decline in occupancy in and early occurred due to a higher than normal number of tenant bankruptcies and early closings  particularly in the first and second quarters of  and  to a lesser extent  from slower leasing activity in occupancy at december  does not include valley mall which was purchased in november at december   anchor occupancy was and total portfolio occupancy anchors  mall stores and freestanding was

change in accounting method on may  the emerging issues task force eitf discussed issue accounting for contingent rent and reached a consensus that lessors should defer the accounting recognition of contingent rent  such as percentage rent  until the specific tenant sales breakpoint target is achieved 
the company s previous accounting method  which was fully acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  recognized percentage rent on a pro rata basis when a tenant s achievement of its sales breakpoint was considered probable 
this eitf consensus can be implemented on a prospective basis  or retroactively as a change in accounting method 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented this eitf consensus as a change in accounting method and accordingly recorded as of january  a million cumulative effect adjustment representing the change on prior years percentage rent income based on the new method of accounting 
the impact on percentage rent income of the new method for the year ended december  was a reduction of percentage rents of about  from what would have been reported under the company s previous method of accounting 
the impact on the fourth quarter of was an increase in percentage rent of approximately  over what would have been reported 
the impact on the previously reported first  second  and third quarters was immaterial 
new accounting pronouncements in the first quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which requires companies to report all changes in equity during a period  except those resulting from investment by owners and distribution to owners  in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized 
fas no 
has no impact on the company s financial statements  as the company s comprehensive income loss is equal to its net income loss at december   as the company has just one reportable operating segment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted fas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
this new standard has not had a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  had the company applied this standard currently  the effect on the company s results of operations at december  would be immaterial 
comparison of year ended december   versus year ended december total revenues were million compared to million in contributing to the decrease in revenues were million lower business interruption insurance  lower cost recovery income due to lower recoverable costs at the properties  million lower lease buyout income due mainly to two kmart anchor lease buyouts in the third and fourth quarters of  million lower small shop base and percentage rents due to lower occupancy earlier in the year partially offset by higher average base rent per foot  million lower anchor base and percentage rents from higher anchor vacancies in  and million lower fees and commissions from sales of non company properties included in miscellaneous income

liquidity and capital resources the company has significant ongoing capital requirements 
the company believes that its cash generated from property operations and funds obtained from property financings and general corporate borrowings will provide the necessary funds on a short term and long term basis for its operating expenses  interest expense on outstanding indebtedness and recurring capital expenditures and tenant allowances  and all dividends to the shareholders necessary to satisfy the reit dividend distribution requirements under the internal revenue code see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company intends to pay regular quarterly dividends to its shareholders 
however  the company s ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors  including cash flow from operations  capital expenditures  and its ability to refinance its maturing debt as described below 
dividends by the company will be at the discretion of the board of trustees and will depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the trustees may consider 
sources of capital for non recurring capital expenditures  such as major building renovations and expansions  as well as for scheduled principal payments  including balloon payments on the outstanding indebtedness  are expected to be obtained from additional company or property financings and refinancings  sale of non strategic assets  additional equity raised in the public or private markets  and from retained internally generated cash flows  or from combinations thereof 
the company has commenced construction of an expansion and redevelopment of washington crown center and an expansion at valley mall 
the total cost of the two projects  including capitalized construction overhead  interest  and tenant allowances  are estimated at million and million respectively  of which million and million  respectively  had been incurred as of december  in addition to amounts incurred at december   the company is committed for future payments under various construction purchase orders and certain leases 
the company has secured through a bank lender a million construction and three year permanent loan for the washington crown center expansion and redevelopment  the loan bears interest at libor plus  and million was borrowed and outstanding at december  for the valley mall expansion  ge capital real estate gecre has agreed to enter into a loan for up to million 
this million loan will be part of the existing million acquisition line of credit with gecre  but will be subject to a separate loan agreement that is currently being prepared and will bear interest at libor plus 
it is anticipated the first construction draw under the gecre loan will occur in spring also  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  on august  the company closed a million year mortgage with ge capital real estate gecre 
the gross proceeds from the new loan the gecre mortgage loan were used to refinance the million kidder mortgage loans  the million interim mortgage loan see below  and the million secured term loan 
the remaining proceeds were used largely to establish escrows to fund the remaining expansion and redevelopment costs of patrick henry mall and nittany mall  and to fund closing costs  initial loan reserves and prepayment penalties with respect to million of the kidder mortgage loans and the million secured term loan that were pre paid prior to their maturity dates 
the prepayment penalties for the kidder mortgage loans and the million term loan were approximately million 
in addition  approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the kidder mortgage loans and the million interim mortgage loan were written off 
both of these items were accounted for as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the gecre mortgage loan has a fixed stated interest rate of and is secured by cross collateralized mortgages on of the malls 
in connection with the gecre mortgage loan  in november  the company made a million interest bearing good faith deposit with gecre  and in july and august  the company made million in non interest bearing rate lock deposits with gecre 
these deposits were refunded at closing 
as of december  the scheduled principal payments on all debt are million  million  million  million  and million for the years ended december  through  respectively  and million thereafter 
the company expects to refinance or extend the majority of the maturities over the next five years through additional company financings and from refinancing the maturing loans 
the company s ability to refinance or extend these loans on or before their due dates depends on the level of income generated by the properties  prevailing interest rates  credit market trends  and other factors that may be in effect at the time of such refinancings or extensions and there is no assurance that such refinancings or extensions will be executed 
the ratios of the company s ebitda to interest paid on total indebtedness exclusive of capitalized interest and interest income for the years ended december    and were to  to  and to  respectively 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  crown investments and its subsidiary and frank j 
pasquerilla have been granted rights  subject to certain restrictions  whereby they may redeem part or all of their common partnership units for common shares  on a one to one basis  or cash at a price equal to the value of the company s common shares 
crown investments has pledged substantially all of its limited partnership units as collateral for a loan it has received from an unrelated third party 
g economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years it has had little impact on the operations of the company during this period 
tenant leases also provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company during highly inflationary periods 
as operating costs increase  leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants and therefore  the tenants will absorb part of this increased operating cost 
most of the leases provide for percentage rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
thus  during highly inflationary periods  when retail sales at the malls increase  the company should receive additional rental income through percentage rent increases  partially offsetting the effect of inflation 
year management of the company has made a preliminary and partial assessment of the so called year problem which relates to the ability of electronic equipment  computer hardware and software to properly recognize date sensitive information on or after january  systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company s assessment and corrective action efforts to date have focused primarily on internal equipment and software used by the company 
based on this preliminary assessment  management estimates that the cost to replace certain electronic and computer equipment and to reprogram certain software will approximate thousand 
beginning in  the company has made significant investments in upgraded computer hardware and third party software operating and financial systems  management believes such new systems are year capable based on communications with the hardware and software vendors and on limited testing 
management also believes that the potential impact and disruption of year on internally used equipment and software  to the extent not replaced or repaired by  should not result in direct material adverse effects on the company s ability to operate 
contributing to this preliminary assessment is the relatively passive nature of the company s business of leasing space to retailers 
however  the company may be impacted in a number of direct and indirect ways if its suppliers and customers tenants and the ultimate consumers  or if the general united states or world economies  are disrupted from the impact of year such effects could include  for example  temporary loss of utilities and telecommunications services which could prevent the shopping malls or tenants from maintaining normal sales hours  disruption of financial services such as processing of checks or credit card transactions  adverse effects on the manufacture and delivery of goods to tenants to be sold in the company s mall properties many such goods are produced outside the united states  and the inability of tenants systems to process sales and control inventories 
it is possible that these effects could reduce tenant sales and thus reduce percentage rents received by the company 
it is also possible that some tenants may be unable to remain in business and thus cease paying rents 
some commentators on year have suggested that year issues could cause  or contribute to  an economic recession which could affect the overall levels of tenant sales  future leasing activity  interest rates  and other general economic factors that could adversely impact the company 
while management of the company is unable to estimate the magnitude of all these effects  they could have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations and financial condition of the company 
management is continuing to complete its efforts to identify non compliant equipment and systems  and to correct and or replace such systems 
management is also beginning to develop contingency plans for both its headquarters and mall properties 
these contingency plans will also address certain potential external effects on the company  including possible loss of utilities 
no assurance can be given that these contingency plans will be sufficient to mitigate all year effects that could impact the company 
h forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended 
such statements are based on assumptions and expectations  which may not be realized and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy 
future events and actual results  financial and otherwise  may differ from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
risk and other factors that might cause differences  some of which could be material  include  but are not limited to  economic and credit market conditions  the ability to refinance maturing indebtedness  the impact of competition  consumer buying trends  financing and development risks  construction and lease up delays  cost overruns  the level and volatility of interest rates  the rate of revenue increases versus expense increases and financial stability of tenants within the retail industry  as well as other risks listed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission or otherwise publicly disseminated by the company 
although management believes that the assumptions made in connection with the forward looking statements are reasonable  there are no assurances that the assumptions and expectations will prove to have been correct due to the foregoing and other factors

the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in millions december  and thereafter long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate interest rate risk for the company decreased in due to a reduction in variable rate debt from million at december  to million at december  the company s variable rate debt is based primarily on libor  and the company will incur increasing interest costs if libor increases 
the company may enter into interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate such risks in the future  but as of december   the company has no such instruments outstanding
