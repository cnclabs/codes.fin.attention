overview a majority of the company s revenues to date have been derived from operations in the state of tennessee under the rxcare contract 
the company assisted rxcare in defining and marketing pbm services to private health plan sponsors on a consulting basis in  but did not commence substantial operations through the provision of pbm services to such plan sponsors until january when the company  through the rxcare contract  began servicing several of the health plan sponsors involved in the then newly instituted tenncare health care benefits program 
see business the tenncare program in item in part i of this annual report 
at december   the company provided pbm services to a total of plan sponsors with an aggregate of approximately million plan members 
as of december   under the rxcare contract  the company serviced six tenncare plan sponsors with approximately million plan members 
the rxcare contract accounted for of the company s revenues for the year ended december  and of the company s revenues for the year ended december  throughout this annual report  all references to the number of members or lives managed by the company under the tenncare program excludes members or lives duplicatively covered under an agreement between the company and tenncare behavioral health plan sponsors 
in prior periodic reports under the exchange act and in previous press releases  the company has counted such members and lives twice when covered under more than one agreement 
the company and rxcare did not renew the rxcare contract which expired on december  the negotiated termination of its relationship with rxcare  among other things  allowed the company to directly market its services to tennessee customers including those then under contract with rxcare prior to the expiration of the rxcare contract 
the rxcare contract had previously prohibited the company from soliciting and or marketing its pbm services in tennessee other than on behalf of  and for the benefit of  rxcare 
the company s marketing efforts during this period resulted in the company executing agreements effective as of january  to provide pbm services directly to five of the six tenncare mco s and  of the tenncare lives previously managed under the rxcare contract as well as substantially all tpa s and employer groups previously managed under the rxcare contract 
the company anticipates that approximately of its revenues for fiscal will be derived from providing pbm services to these five tenncare mco s 
to date  the company has been unable to secure a contract with the two tenncare bho s to which it previously provided pbm services under the rxcare contract 
for the year ended december   amounts paid to the company by these bho s represented approximately of the company s revenues 
the company has made operational adjustments determined to be necessary due to the bho and mco contract losses 
acquisition on august   the company completed its acquisition of continental  a company which provides pharmacy benefit management services and mail order pharmacy services 
the acquisition was treated as a purchase for financial reporting purposes 
the company issued  shares of common stock as consideration for the purchase 
the aggregate purchase price  including acquisition costs of approximately million  approximated million 
the fair value of assets acquired approximated million and liabilities assumed approximated million  resulting in approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives years and years  respectively 
the consolidated financial statements of the company included in item of this annual report for the year ended december  include the results of operations and financial position of continental from and after the date of acquisition 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   the company recorded revenue of million  an increase of million over the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in revenues resulted from increased commercial business  including million from a nevada based managed care organization the nevada plans 
the acquisition of continental resulted in increased revenues of million  including million attributable to mail order pharmacy services 
the company anticipates that mail order pharmacy services will generate approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the increase in commercial revenues resulted from managing an additional plans covering an additional  lives under new and existing commercial plans 
revenue from tenncare contracts increased approximately million as a result of two new contracts entered into in the fourth quarter of million and contract renewals on more favorable terms and increased enrollment in the tenncare plans million  partially offset by a decrease in revenues of million resulting from the restructuring of a major tenncare contract in april for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were generated from capitated or other risk based contracts  compared to for the year ended december  effective january   the company began providing pbm services directly to five of the six tenncare mco s previously managed under the rxcare contract 
the company will be compensated on a capitated basis under three of the five tenncare contracts  thereby increasing the company s financial risk in as compared to based upon its present contracted arrangements  the company anticipates that approximately of its revenues in will be derived from capitated or other risk based contracts 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to the prior year 
new commercial contracts together with increased enrollment in existing commercial plans accounted for million of the increase in cost of revenue  including million relating to the nevada plans 
costs attributable to the acquisition of continental accounted for million of the increase in cost of revenue 
costs related to tenncare contracts increased cost of revenue million 
costs relating to the two new tenncare contracts accounted for million of such increase  while increased enrollment in existing tenncare plans increased cost of revenue million 
these cost increases were offset by the restructuring of a major tenncare contract in april  which resulted in a decrease in cost of revenue of million 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily as a result of contract renewals on more favorable terms 
generally  loss contracts arise only on capitated or other risk based contracts and primarily result from higher than expected pharmacy utilization rates  higher than expected inflation in drug costs and the inability to restrict formularies to the extent contemplated by the company at the time a contract is entered into  thereby resulting in higher than expected drug costs 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
after analyzing those factors described above  the company recorded a million reserve in december with respect to the nevada plans 
the arrangements with the nevada plans were terminated in august the reserve established was adequate to absorb the actual losses 
management does not believe that there is an overall trend towards losses on its existing capitated contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to million for the year ended december  the acquisition of continental accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining million increase in expenses reflects expenditures incurred in connection with the company s continuing commitment to enhance its ability to manage efficiently pharmacy benefits by investing in additional operational and clinical personnel and information systems to support new and existing customers  partially offset by lower legal costs 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as revenue increases did not result in proportional increases in expenditures 
the company recorded a non recurring charge against earnings of million in connection with its negotiated termination of its relationship with rxcare rxcare settlement 
see overview 
in addition  the company recorded a non recurring charge against earnings of million in connection with the conclusion of an agreement in principle with respect to a civil settlement of the federal and state of tennessee investigation tennessee settlement relating to the conduct of two former officers one of which is a former director and still principal stockholder of the company of a subsidiary prior to the company s offering 
the tennessee settlement is subject to several conditions  including the execution of a definitive agreement 
the company anticipates that the investigation will be fully resolved with this settlement 
see item  legal proceedings  in part i of this annual report 
for the year ended december   the company recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangibles of million in connection with its acquisition of continental 
the continental acquisition resulted in the recording of approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets  which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives years and years  respectively 
the company anticipates that its annual amortization of goodwill and other intangibles will be approximately million in fiscal for the year ended december   the company recorded interest income  net of interest expense  of million 
interest income was million  a decrease of million from a year ago  resulting from a reduced level of invested capital due to the additional working capital needs of the company 
see liquidity and capital resources 
for the year ended december   the company recorded net income of million  or 
per diluted share  before recording the million and million non recurring charges for the rxcare settlement and tennessee settlement  respectively 
net income for the year ended december   after recording the non recurring charges  was million  or 
per diluted share 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share 
for the year ended december   accounts receivable increased million to million from million for the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from a proportionate increase in pbm business during the period 
in addition  the company s acquisition of continental accounted for approximately million of the increase in accounts receivable and delays in the receipt of payments from certain fee for service pbm clients and drug manufacturers accounted for approximately million of the increase in accounts receivable 
because a substantial majority of these payments were collected by the company in the first quarter of  the company does not believe that this increase in accounts receivable in due to delayed payments reflects a trend or that the company s liquidity has been or will be materially adversely affected 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   the company recorded revenues of million compared with revenues of million  a decrease of million  or 
in an effort to stem future losses and increase profitability  the company through rxcare  terminated the capitated contract with blue cross blue shield of tennessee  inc bcbs effective march  although this contract previously had been renegotiated and extended  high utilization rates continued to hamper the company s ability to gain profitability under the contract even though the company was able to lower average cost of each prescription 
subsequent to the termination of the original bcbs contract  the company had negotiated a contract directly rather than through rxcare with an affiliate of bcbs to begin pharmacy benefit management services on april  although the company continued to provide essentially the same services under such restructured contract as it did before the restructuring  the new contract eliminated capitation risk to the company and provides for payment of certain administrative and clinical consulting services on a fee for service basis 
the restructuring in april of the bcbs contract decreased revenue for the year ended december  compared to december  by million 
this decrease in revenues was offset by an increase of million in other tenncare business resulting from increased enrollment and several favorable contract restructurings 
further revenue increases of million resulted from increased enrollment in existing commercial plans as well as the servicing of new commercial plans covering approximately  new members throughout the united states 
cost of revenue for decreased to million from million for  a decrease of million 
the above described restructuring of the bcbs contract resulted in a decrease in cost of revenue of million 
costs relating to the remaining tenncare contracts increased by million due to eligibility increases  increased drug prices and increased utilization of prescription drugs 
increased enrollment in existing commercial plans together with several new commercial contracts resulted in a million increase in cost of revenue 
included in cost of revenues for commercial business is a million reserve established to cover anticipated future losses under certain of the nevada plans 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to in from in for the year ended december   gross profit decreased million to million  after recording the million reserve previously described  from million at december  gross profit increases of million in tenncare business resulted from favorable contract renegotiations as well as increased eligibility  offset by decreases of million in commercial business resulting primarily from the nevada plans 
the nevada plans generated million in gross losses in the fourth quarter of including a million reserve for anticipated future losses 
the company believed this reserve to be a reasonable estimate of its exposure 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in  an increase of 
the million increase was attributable to expenses associated with an expanded national sales effort  additional headquarter personnel and operations support needed to service new business and increases in legal and consulting fees 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in for the year ended december   the company recorded interest income of million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase resulted from funds invested from the company s offering being invested for the entire year in as opposed to only five months in for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million  or per share 
this compares with a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended december  before recording a million nonrecurring  non cash stock option charge 
the charge in represented the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair market value of the common stock granted by the company s then principal stockholder to certain then unaffiliated third parties who later become executive officers and directors of the company 
this increase in net loss is the result of the above described changes in revenue  cost of revenue and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company utilizes both funds generated from operations  if any  and funds raised in the offering for capital expenditures and working capital needs 
for the year ended december   net cash used by the company for operating activities totaled million  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from increased pbm business  the acquisition of continental s accounts receivable million and certain changes in payment patterns primarily attributable to certain delays in payments million 
because a substantial majority of the delayed payments were collected by the company in the first quarter of  the company does not believe that this increase in accounts receivable in due to delayed payments reflects a trend or that the company s liquidity has been or will be materially adversely affected 
such uses were offset by a million increase in claims payable  a million increase in payables to plan sponsors and others and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
the increases in claims payable and payables to plan sponsors and others increased primarily due to increases in pbm business  partially offset by reductions in the percentage of drug manufacturer rebates owed by the company to certain clients under rebate sharing arrangements 
accrued expenses increased due to the accrual of million in connection with the tennessee settlement 
investing activities generated million in cash from proceeds of maturities of investment securities of million  offset by the purchase of investment securities of approximately million 
the company purchased million of equipment primarily to upgrade and enhance information systems necessary to strengthen and support the company s ability to manage its customer s pharmacy benefit programs and to be competitive in the pbm industry 
financing activities generated million of cash primarily from an increase in debt of million 
at december   the company had working capital of million  including million in investment securities  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  compared with million at december  the company had investment securities held to maturity of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash and investment securities was due to the company s increased working capital requirements 
with the exception of the company s million preferred stock investment in wang healthcare information systems  inc whis  the company s investments are primarily corporate debt securities rated aa or higher and government securities 
in june  the company s invested million in the preferred stock of whis  a company engaged in the development  sales and marketing of pc based information systems for physicians and their staff  using image based technology 
as discussed above  effective january   the company began to provide pbm services directly to five of the six tenncare mco s and  of the tenncare lives previously managed under the rxcare contract 
to date  however  the company has been unable to secure a contract with the sixth tenncare mco or with either of the two tenncare bho s for which it previously provided pbm services under the rxcare contract 
the company does not believe that the loss of these contracts will have a material adverse effect on its liquidity in fiscal on march   the state of tennessee and xantus entered into a consent decree whereby  among other things  the commissioner of commerce and insurance for the state of tennessee was appointed receiver of xantus for purposes of rehabilitation 
due to the fact that the receiver was appointed at the time of the filing of this annual report  the company is unable to predict the consequences of this appointment on the company s ability to retain xantus s business or its ability to collect monies owed to it by xantus 
as of march   xantus owes the company million relating to pbm services rendered by the company in the failure of the company to collect all or a substantial portion of the monies owed to it by xantus would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
under section of the delaware general corporation law section and the company s amended and restated by laws by laws  the company is obligated to indemnify two former officers one of which is a former director and still principal stockholder of the company of a subsidiary who are the subject of the federal and state of tennessee investigation described above  unless it is ultimately determined by the company s board of directors that these former officers failed to act in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the company  that they had reason to believe that their conduct was unlawful or for any other reason consistent with section or the by laws 
in addition  until the board makes such a determination  the company is obligated under section and its by laws to advance the costs of defense to such persons  however  if the board determines that either or both of these former officer are not entitled to indemnification  such individuals would be obligated to reimburse the company for all amounts so advanced 
the company is not presently in a position to assess the likelihood that either or both of these former officers will be entitled to such indemnification and advancement of defense costs or to estimate the total amount that it may have to pay in connection with such obligations or the time period over which such amounts may have to be advanced 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company s obligations to either or both of these former officers would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
from time to time  the company may be a party to legal proceedings or involved in related investigations  inquiries or discussions  in each case  arising in the ordinary course of the company s business 
although no assurance can be given  management does not presently believe that any current matters would have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  financial position or results of operations of the company 
at december   the company had  for tax purposes  unused net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which will begin expiring in as it is uncertain whether the company will realize the full benefit from these carryforwards  the company has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset generated by the carryforwards 
the company assesses the need for a valuation allowance at each balance sheet date 
the company has undergone a change in control as defined by the internal revenue code of  as amended code  and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder 
the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any given year will be subject to a limitation as a result of this change 
the annual limitation approximates million 
actual utilization in any year will vary based on the company s tax position in that year 
as the company continues to grow  it anticipates that its working capital needs will also continue to increase 
the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during fiscal primarily for expansion and upgrading of information systems 
the company believes that it has sufficient cash on hand or available to fund the company s anticipated working capital and other cash needs for at least the next months 
the company also may pursue joint venture arrangements  business acquisitions and other transactions designed to expand its pbm business  which the company would expect to fund from cash on hand or future indebtedness or  if appropriate  the sale or exchange of equity securities of the company 
other matters the company s pharmaceutical claims costs historically have been subject to significant increase over annual averages from october through february  which the company believes is due to increased medical requirements during the colder months 
the resulting increase in pharmaceutical costs impacts the profitability of capitated contracts or other risk based arrangements 
risk based business represented approximately of the company s revenues while non risk business including the provision of mail order services represented approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  non risk arrangements mitigate the adverse effect on profitability of higher pharmaceutical costs incurred under risk based contracts 
the company presently anticipates that approximately of its revenues in fiscal will be derived from risk based arrangements 
changes in prices charged by manufacturers and wholesalers or distributors for pharmaceuticals  a component of pharmaceutical claims  have historically affected the company s cost of revenue 
the company believes that it is likely for prices to continue to increase which could have an adverse effect on the company s gross profit 
to the extent such cost increases adversely effect the company s gross profit  the company may be required to increase contract rates on new contracts and upon renewal of existing contracts 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining these rate increases 
the higher level of non risk contracts with the company s customers in and compared to prior years mitigates the adverse effects of price increases  although no assurance can be given that the recent trend towards no risk arrangements will continue 
year disclosure the so called year problem  which is common to many companies  concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer hardware and software programs  to recognize properly and process date sensitive information following december  the company has committed substantial resources approximately million over the past two years to improve its information systems is project 
the company has used this is project as an opportunity to evaluate its state of readiness  estimate expected costs and identify and quantify risks associated with any potential year issues 
state of readiness in evaluating the company s exposure to the year problem  management first identified those systems that were critical to the ongoing business of the company and that would require significant manual intervention should those systems be unable to process dates correctly following december  those systems were the company s claims adjudication and processing system and the internal accounting system which includes pharmacy reimbursement 
once those systems were identified  the following steps were identified as those that would be required to be taken to ascertain the company s state of readiness i 
obtaining letters from software and hardware vendors concerning the ability of their products to properly process dates after december   ii 
testing the operating systems of all hardware used in the identified information systems to determine if dates after december  can be processed correctly  iii 
surveying other parties who provide or process information in electronic format to the company as to their state of readiness and ability to process dates after december   and iv 
testing the identified information systems to confirm that they will properly recognize and process dates after december  the company excluding for purposes of this year discussion only  continental has completed step i 
the company will continue to obtain letters from new hardware and software vendors 
the company is currently in the process of implementing step ii 
the company has begun testing its operating systems  and where appropriate software patches have been acquired 
any software or hardware determined to be non compliant will be modified  repaired or replaced 
installation of patches and full operating systems testing is anticipated to be completed during the second quarter of the company cannot estimate the costs of such modifications  repairs and replacements at this time  but does not believe that the costs of such modifications  repairs or replacements will be material 
the company will disclose the results of its testing and attempt to further quantify this estimate in future periodic reports following its completion of step ii 
with respect to step iii above  the company has engaged in discussions with the third party vendors that transmit data from member pharmacies and based upon such discussions it believes that such third party vendors systems will be able to properly recognize and process dates after december  the company is in the process of surveying member pharmacies in its network as to their ability to transmit data correctly to such third party vendors and anticipates completing this survey during the second quarter of once this survey is complete  the company will evaluate any additional steps required to allow member pharmacies to transmit data after december  and will disclose such additional steps  if any  and their related costs in future periodic reports 
with respect to step iv above  the company intends to perform a comprehensive year compliance test of the claims adjudication and processing systems as part of the next regularly scheduled disaster recovery drill  which is currently planned for june this date has been postponed from the previously scheduled march test in order to incorporate software upgrades during the second quarter of the company s internal accounting and other administrative systems generally have been internally developed during the last few years or are presently being developed 
accordingly  in light of the fact that such systems were developed with a view to year compliance  the company fully expects that these systems will be able to properly recognize and process dates after december  the company intends to test these systems for year compliance as part of the disaster recovery drill described above 
continental s computer systems related to the delivery of medications through mail order were upgraded in the fourth quarter of to become year compliant 
the company will disclose its ongoing assessment of continental s state of readiness in future periodic reports 
costs as noted above  the company spent approximately million over the past two years to improve its information systems 
in addition  the company anticipates that it will spend approximately million over the next months to further improve its information systems 
these improvements were not specifically instituted to address the year issue  but rather to address other business issues 
nonetheless  the is project provided the company with a platform from which to address any year issues 
management does not believe that the amount of funds expended in connection with the is project would have differed materially in the absence of the year problem 
the company s cash on hand as a result of the offering has provided all of the funds expended to date on the is project and is expected to provide substantially all of the funds expected to be spent in the next months on the is project 
risks on july   the commission issued release no 
the release in an effort to provide further guidance to reporting companies concerning disclosure of the year problem 
in this release the commission required that registrants include in its year disclosure a description of its most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
based on the company s assessment and the results of remediation performed to date as described above  the company believes that all problems related to the year will be addressed in a timely manner so that the company will experience little or no disruption in its business immediately following december  however  if unforeseen difficulties arise  if the company s assessment of continental uncovers significant problems which is not presently expected to occur or if compliance testing is delayed or necessary remediation efforts are not accomplished in accordance with the company s plans described above  the company anticipates that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario as required to be described by the release is that some percentage of the company s claims would need to be processed manually for some limited period of time 
at this point in time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the number of pharmacies or the level of claims involved or the costs that would be incurred if the company were required to hire temporary staff and incur other expenses to manually process such claims 
the company expects to be better able to quantify the number of pharmacies and level of claims involved as well as the related costs following its completion of the survey of member pharmacies in the second quarter of and presently intends to disclose such estimates in future periodic reports 
in addition  the company anticipates that all businesses regardless of their state of readiness  including the company  will encounter some minimal level of disruption in its business eg  phone and fax systems  alarm systems  etc 
as a result of the year problem 
however  the company does not believe that it will incur any material expenses or suffer any material loss of revenues in connection with such minimal disruptions 
contingency plans as discussed above  in the event of the occurrence of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario the company would hire an appropriate level of temporary staff to manually process the pharmacy claims submitted on paper 
as discussed above  at this time the company cannot reasonably estimate the number of pharmacies or level of claims involved or the costs that would be incurred if the company were required to hire temporary staff and incur other expenses to manually process such claims 
while some level of manual processing is common in the industry and while manual processing increases the time it takes the company to pay the member pharmacies and invoice the related payors  the company does not foresee any material lost revenues or other material expenses in connection with this scenario 
however  an extended delay in processing claims  making payments to pharmacies and billing the company s customers could materially adversely impact the company s liquidity 
in addition  while not part of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  the delay in paying such pharmacies for their claims could result in adverse relations between the company and the pharmacies 
such adverse relations could cause certain pharmacies to drop out of the company s networks which in turn could cause the company to be in breach under service area provisions under certain of its services agreements with its customers 
the company does not believe that any material relationship with any pharmacy will be so affected or that any material number of pharmacies would withdraw from the company s networks or that it will breach any such service area provision of any contract with its customers 
notwithstanding the foregoing  based upon past experience  the company believes that it could quickly replace any such withdrawing pharmacy so as to prevent any breach of any such provision 
the company cannot presently reasonably estimate the possible impact in terms of lost revenues  additional expenses or litigation damages or expenses that could result from such events 
forward looking statements certain information set forth above regarding the year problem and the company s plans to address those problems are forward looking statements under the securities act and the exchange act 
see the first paragraph in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties 
in addition  certain factors particular to the year problem could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements  including  without limitation failure to identify critical information systems which experience failures  delays and errors in the compliance and remediation efforts described above  unexpected failures by key vendors  member pharmacies  software providers or business partners to be year compliant or the inability to repair critical information systems in the time frames described above 
in any such event  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the failure to be year compliant of third parties outside of the company s control such as electric utilities or financial institutions could adversely effect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk represents the only market risk exposure applicable to the company 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investments in marketable securities 
all of these instruments are classified as held to maturity on the company s consolidated balance sheet and were entered into by the company solely for investment purposes and not for trading purposes 
the company does not invest in or otherwise use derivative financial instruments 
the company s investments consist primarily of corporate debt securities  corporate preferred stock and state and local governmental obligations  each rated aa or higher 
the table below presents principal cash flow amounts and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates for the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk thereafter short term investments fixed rate investments  weighted average rate long term investments fixed rate investments weighted average rate long term debt variable rate instruments  weighted average rate in the table above  the weighted average interest rate for fixed and variable rate financial instruments in each year was computed utilizing the effective interest rate at december  for that instrument multiplied by the percentage obtained by dividing the principal payments expected in that year with respect to that instrument by the aggregate expected principal payments with respect to all financial instruments within the same class of instrument 
at december   the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable and payables to plan sponsors and others approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
because management does not believe that its exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time  the company has not developed or implemented a strategy to manage this market risk through the use of derivative financial instruments or otherwise 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate market risk from time to time and will develop and implement strategies to manage that risk as appropriate
