the company has concluded that it will not be necessary to replace its retail point of sale hardware and that  based on information available at this time  the remaining costs to implement the year readiness program will not be material 
communication with respect to year issues with the company s suppliers is ongoing 
while not expected  the company may experience delays in receipt of product  which could adversely affect sales and earnings 
the company cannot currently estimate to what extent future operating results might be adversely affected by the possible failure of these third parties to successfully address their year issues 
however  the company s program includes actions designed to identify and minimize  where possible  any third party exposure 
costs to implement the year readiness program are based on management s estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions related to future events 
there can be no assurance that additional costs will not be incurred  or that the objective of the program will be achieved 
however  the company continues to monitor activities related to the program designed to ensure year readiness 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary liquidity needs arise from debt service on indebtedness incurred in connection with the sybra acquisition  the lyon s acquisition  operating lease requirement and the funding of capital expenditures primarily for new store openings

the usrp loan has a weighted average maturity of years  a weighted average interest rate of  requires monthly payments of principal and interest  is collateralized by substantially all of the assets owned by lyon s and imposes certain financial restrictions and covenants 
the company s primary source of liquidity during the year was the operation of the restaurants owned by its principal operating subsidiaries  sybra and lyon s and debt and lease financing 
in the future  the company s liquidity and capital resources will primarily depend on the operations of sybra and lyon s which  under the provisions of the company s loan agreements  would permit  under certain conditions  distributions and dividends to the company 
sybra and lyon s  like most restaurant businesses  are able to operate with nominal or deficit working capital because all sales are for cash and inventory turnover is rapid 
renovation and or remodeling of existing restaurants is either funded directly from available cash or  in some instances  is financed through outside lenders 
construction or acquisition of new restaurants is generally  although not always  financed by outside lenders 
the company believes that it will continue to be able to secure adequate financing on acceptable terms for new restaurants construction and acquisitions and that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurances can be given 
recent developments on december   the company acquired substantially all the assets of lyon s restaurants  inc the assets acquired include a chain of family dining restaurants  located primarily in northern california and operating under the lyon s name

the company anticipates that store maintenance  store remodel and store renovation capital expenditures for will approximate million 
the level of capital expenditures for new store development and acquisitions will be dependent upon several factors  including the number of stores constructed and or acquired  the availability of appropriate financing as well as the capital structure of any such transactions 
inflation certain of the company s operating costs are subject to inflationary pressures  of which the most significant are food and labor costs
