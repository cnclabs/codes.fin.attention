at the end of  american country decided not to market any personal lines business and not to accept any new personal lines business from independent agents 
as a result of these efforts  american country recorded a charge of approximately  in primarily for termination benefits that were paid in that is estimated to result in future annual savings in salaries and benefits 
in addition  fixed income advisors have been engaged to enhance the quality and yield on the portfolio of invested assets 
the calendar year compared to the calendar year the following table sets forth the net premiums earned by the principal lines or products of insurance underwritten by american country for the periods indicated and the dollar amount and percentage of change therein from year to year net premiums earned increase year ended decrease december  to amount transportation lines    other commercial lines   hospitality lines    personal lines   totals    transportation lines  which consists of taxi and limousine liability and physical damage programs  grew during as a result of american country s geographic expansion into additional states

american country s hospitality lines experienced the largest percentage growth in premium revenues over other lines  increasing nearly to million in as compared to million in the hospitality program accomplished its significant growth outside of illinois by expanding into the states of minnesota and new jersey 
premium revenues generated from american country s other commercial lines decreased slightly in to million from million for  a decrease 
this decrease is attributable to american country s re underwriting program as well as the continuing pricing competition industry wide for commercial lines 
american country also realized additional savings by renegotiating reinsurance costs for its commercial lines 
premium revenues for personal lines decreased from million for to  for  a decrease of 
the decrease is attributable to the reinsurance agreement entered into at the beginning of  pursuant to which nearly all of american country s personal lines business was reinsured by ohio casualty and to american country s decision to cease marketing personal lines business and to cease accepting personal lines business from independent agents 
net investment income increased nominally during income earned on invested assets amounted to million during as compared to million for although invested assets increased during the period  declining yields resulted in only a increase in earned investment income 
realized gains for decreased  an decrease from upon the appointment of professional investment advisors in late  the company s portfolio of invested assets was restructured to achieve stated guidelines  and as a result  significant gains were realized 
investment expenses for were  as compared to million in  which resulted in savings of  in  primarily the result of the appointment of professional investment advisors 
other income  which consists of interest and fees earned on premium financing activities decreased from  in to  in  a decrease 
the decrease is the result of the lower volume of premiums finance contracts entered into in the following table sets forth american country s statutory combined ratio and gaap combined ratio for the periods indicated statutory combined gaap combined ratio year ratio year ended ended december  december  losses loss adjustment expenses lae losses and lae policy acquisition  other underwriting expenses total combined ratio loss and loss adjustment expenses for decreased from of premium revenues during to for this decrease is attributable to lower claims activity in all lines and also reflects cost reductions effected in late primarily through savings in payments to staff and legal support 
transportation lines loss ratios continued to improve during  with a loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of as compared to for this decrease is attributable to savings in loss adjustment expense realized through staff reductions effected in the fourth quarter of the ratio for losses and lae for hospitality lines declined slightly to in from in although claims activity increased during due to the geographic and market expansion of this program  loss ratios remained relatively constant during the year 
the ratio of losses and lae for other commercial lines decreased to in as compared to in much of this improvement is the result of the re underwriting program initiated for these lines in and to a lower severity in claims during the year 
workers compensation and multi peril liability and property coverages were the lines most responsible for effecting this improvement 
the ratio of losses and lae for personal lines during decreased to compared to in  primarily due to the reinsurance agreement with ohio casualty and the decision to cease marketing this business and accepting personal lines business from independent agents 
policy acquisition costs decreased  or during however  when expressed as a percentage of premium revenues  policy acquisition costs increased from in to for the increase is attributable to additional acquisition expenses being incurred in connection with american country s geographical expansion into new states and increased costs  primarily commissions paid to producers 
administrative and general expenses increased in as a result of higher corporate expenses incurred in connection with acquisition and financing activities of the company 
expenses of the operating companies decreased to million as compared to million in the decrease is attributable to cost saving initiatives begun during the fourth quarter of  primarily staff reductions

calendar year compared to calendar year the following table sets forth the net premiums earned by the principal lines or products of insurance underwritten by american country for the periods indicated and the dollar amount and percentage of change therein from year to year net premiums earned increase year ended decrease december  to in thousands transportation lines    hospitality lines   other commercial lines    personal lines   totals   transportation lines  which consists of taxi and limousine liability and physical damage programs  grew during the period as more accounts were underwritten and american country began its geographic diversification program after the acquisition in july  total premium revenues generated by this line increased nearly over the prior years to million in from million in this increase is attributable to coverage written for chicago suburban taxis and limousines and american country s expansion into the states of michigan and wisconsin 
hospitality lines premium revenues decreased slightly to million from million in this decrease is attributable to the softening of certain commercial pricing and also to the re underwriting program initiated during the fourth quarter of other commercial lines declined in revenue contribution by decreasing approximately over this decrease was due to the continuing soft pricing market being experienced industry wide 
average premiums on american country s workers compensation line its largest commercial lines product decreased on new business over the same period for and on renewal business 
management is observing this situation very closely and in the fourth quarter of instituted a re underwriting program to reevaluate each risk on the policy s renewal date 
personal lines premiums generated revenues of million in  representing a increase over this slower growth rate over the recent years represents action taken by management due to its concern with the poor returns experienced for this line 
effective as of january   an agreement was signed with ohio casualty  a major writer of personal lines business  pursuant to which ohio casualty reinsures nearly all of american country s personal lines business 
with an increase in invested assets of in  net investment income and realized gains on investments increased over  due principally to increased realized gains 
although investment expenses increased more than for the full year  the acquisition investment expense has been substantially reduced on an ongoing basis by eliminating investment fees previously paid to the former parent of the company and by changing the custodial bank 
early in the fourth quarter  the company engaged two professional fixed income investment advisors to review and manage its investment portfolio 
since this engagement  the company has seen improvement in its investment returns 
other income  principally income generated by the premium financing activity of financial services  increased from  in to  for  an increase of 
the following table sets forth american country s statutory combined ratio and gaap combined ratio for the periods indicated statutory combined gaap combined ratio year ratio year ended ended december  december  losses loss adjustment expenses lae losses and lae policy acquisition  other underwriting expenses total combined ratio losses and loss adjustment expenses for increased from of premium revenues during to for this increase is attributable to higher claims in personal and commercial lines 
american country s transportation lines continued to perform well  resulting in a combined ratio of for this compared to a combined ratio of for this slight deterioration is attributable to a slight increase in the loss and lae ratio and to increased acquisition costs due to geographic expansion of this program during the fourth quarter 
losses and loss adjustment expense for american country s hospitality lines decreased from levels resulting in a loss ratio of for as compared to for this reduction is the result of lower frequency of claims for hospitality lines  as well as reduced adjustment costs 
the ratio of losses and lae for other commercial lines increased from during to in the increase reflects the continuing industry wide decline in net premiums written for this type of insurance primarily due to price competition 
as with the personal lines  management is closely evaluating this line  with special emphasis being placed on re underwriting individual risks and programs to improve returns 
the ratio of losses and lae for personal lines during increased to compared to for  due to a general increase in claims  and the occurrence of two catastrophic losses during the period 
as a result of the poor results derived from this line of business  management decided to significantly reduce its business in this line  and effective january   entered into an agreement with ohio casualty pursuant to which nearly all of this line was reinsured by ohio casualty without further exposure to american country 
commission and acquisition costs were slightly higher for  which is attributable to the fact that american country s business written by independent producers increased in general and administrative expenses increased due in part to nonrecurring expenses of approximately million associated with the acquisition and related activities and with interest expense on the bank loan incurred in connection with the acquisition 
asset portfolio review at december   the company s total assets of million was comprised of the following cash and investments   reinsurance recoverables   premiums receivable   deferred expenses policy acquisition costs and deferred taxes  fixed assets   and other assets  the company generally invests in securities with fixed maturities with the objective of providing reasonable returns while limiting liquidity and credit risk 
as a result  its investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income debt securities which are rated as investment grade with a carrying value of million and constituting of the company s fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  the company s fixed asset maturity securities included mortgage backed bonds of million and million  respectively  which are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments can cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that have an amortized cost greater than par that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss  while securities that have an amortized cost less than par that are backed by mortgages that prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in gain or yield 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between its amortized cost and par  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
at december   the following table provides a profile of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio by rating amount market percent of s p moody s rating value portfolio aaa aaa including us treasuries of   aa aa  a a  bbb ba  all other  total  the company does not own or utilize derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging  enhancing the overall return of its investment portfolio  or reducing the cost of its debt obligations 
the company employs traditional investment management tools and techniques to address the yield and valuation exposures of its invested assets 
the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is managed so as to limit various risks inherent in the bond market 
credit risk is addressed through adequate diversification and the purchase of investment grade securities 
reinvestment rate risk is controlled by concentrating on non callable issues  and through asset liability matching practices 
purchases of mortgage and asset backed securities  which have variable principal prepayment options  are generally avoided 
market value risk is limited through the purchase of bonds of intermediate maturity 
the combination of these investment management tenets generally provides a more stable long term fixed maturity investment portfolio that is not subject to extreme interest rate sensitivity and principal deterioration 
the market value of the company s long term fixed maturity investment portfolio is sensitive  however  to fluctuations in the level of interest rates  but not materially affected by changes in anticipated cash flows caused by any prepayments 
the impact of interest rates movements on the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio generally affects net realized gains or losses when securities are sold 
with a market value of approximately million  the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio has an average maturity of years and an indicated duration of 
this implies that a basis point parallel increase in interest rates from current levels would result in a possible decline in the market value of the long term fixed maturity investment portfolio of approximately  or million 
these possible declines in values for bond and stock portfolios would affect negatively the common stockholders equity at any point in time  but would not necessarily result in the recognition of realized investment losses as long as operating cash flow and the ongoing emergence of bond maturities continued to provide sufficient funds to meet obligations to policyholders and claimants  as well as debt service and cash dividend requirements at the holding company level 
liquidity and capital resources as a holding company  the company receives cash principally through fees and dividends from subsidiaries and borrowings  certain of which are subject to dividend restrictions and regulatory approval 
the ability of insurance companies to underwrite insurance is based on maintaining liquidity and capital resources sufficient to pay claims and expenses as they become due 
the primary sources of liquidity for american country are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income  commissions and fee income  and proceeds from the sales and maturities of portfolio investments 
the principal expenditures are for payment of losses and lae  operating expenses  commissions and dividends to stockholders 
the company believes its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet its cash requirements 
the company maintains a liquid operating position and follows investment guidelines that are intended to provide acceptable return on investment while preserving capital  maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations and maintaining a sufficient margin of capital and surplus to ensure american country s unimpaired ability to write insurance 
cash flow generated from operations for the year ended december  and was  and million respectively  which amounts were adequate to meet all obligations during the periods 
the decrease in cash flow for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily related to the decrease in personal lines premiums and to a decrease in loss reserves 
on july   the company obtained a million revolving loan credit facility under which it borrowed million at an initial rate of based upon libor  payable quarterly  to fund a portion of the million paid in connection with the acquisition 
on april  the company negotiated a million revolving line of credit facility with a new lender bearing a maturity date of april  interest on the borrowings under the facility may be based on the prime rate minus one percent  eurodollar loan or the federal funds rate 
at december   the unused portion of the line of credit was million 
the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding line of credit for was 
total interest expense in and was  and  respectively 
repayment of this debt is expected to be funded by dividends from the operating subsidiaries 
the line of credit agreement contains various debt covenants including conditions for prepayment and certain financial covenants 
the company is in compliance with all covenants of the agreement as of december  the most restrictive covenant being the ratio of debt to equity 
in addition  there is a commitment fee of 
per annum charged for the unused portion of the total credit facility 
income taxes the company s federal income tax returns for all periods prior to the acquisition were consolidated with those of its former owner 
income tax expenses were computed on a separate company basis 
for the period april   through july   american country and financial services filed a consolidated return with its previous parent  american country holdings corp 
effective with the acquisition on july   the company files a consolidated return with its subsidiaries  and accordingly the company has executed a tax sharing agreement  which requires the subsidiaries to pay the company amounts equal to the federal income tax that would be payable if the subsidiaries filed on a stand alone basis 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the current temporary differences will reverse during the periods in which the company generates net taxable income 
there are  however  no assurances that the company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning strategies could be implemented to supplement income from operations to fully utilize recorded tax benefits 
regulation in its ongoing effort to improve solvency regulation  the naic and individual states have enacted certain laws and financial statement changes 
the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specific corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level or  with negative trend 
the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for american company were in excess of their required amounts at both december  and the naic recently completed its process of recodifying statutory accounting practices codification  the result of which is the only source of prescribed statutory accounting practices after adoption by the state of domicile 
it is expected that codification will be adopted by the state of illinois and be implemented in  which will likely change  to some extent  prescribed  statutory accounting practices  and may result in changes in the company s insurance subsidiary s statutory surplus 
the purpose of these regulatory efforts at all levels is to improve the solvency of insurers 
these regulatory initiatives  and the overall focus on solvency  may intensify the restructuring and consolidation of the insurance industry 
while the impact of these regulatory efforts on the company s operations cannot be quantified until enacted  the company believes it will be adequately capitalized to compete in an environment of more stringent regulation 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  american country attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  american country may be limited in raising its premiums commensurate with anticipated inflation  in which event american country  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on american country s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on american country s investment income
