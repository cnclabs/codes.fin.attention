item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
overview on january   we sold the assets of our cvs operations  including our mps r myocardial protection system product line  to atrion corporation atrion 
see note sale of cvs operations discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received approximately million in cash from the sale 
we also granted atrion a nine month option to acquire our principal office and manufacturing facility in allen  texas for million 
atrion exercised the option to acquire the facility during october and the transaction closed on february  we repaid the outstanding mortgage debt on the facility at closing and received net proceeds of million after paying expenses related to the transaction 
no material gain or loss was realized on the sale of the facility 
we are leasing space  furniture and equipment from atrion until may at the monthly rate of  and are paying atrion fifty percent of certain operating expenses 
at that time we will move our operations to a  square foot leased facility in plano  texas  a northeast suburb of dallas 
the expense of moving and transitioning into the new facility is expected to be immaterial 
assets of the cvs operations sold to atrion primarily consisted of accounts receivable  inventories  furniture and fixtures  manufacturing tooling and equipment  and intangible assets including patents  trademarks and purchased technology 
the intangible assets also included the rights to the name quest medical  inc  our former name 
we reported a pretax gain on the transaction of million during the year ended december  this pretax gain is net of  compensation expense recorded as a result of changes made to the stock options held by employees of the cvs operations 
see note stockholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the pretax gain is also net of an expense of  recorded in connection with sale of the facility to atrion which relates to abated property taxes 
see note sale of cvs operations discontinued operations of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilized million of the proceeds from the sale to retire debt and pay expenses related to the transaction 
we are utilizing the remaining proceeds for working capital for our expanding ans business and for the repurchase of issued and outstanding shares 
during  the board of directors approved stock repurchase programs of up to  shares of the company s common stock at prices and terms to be determined in light of then current circumstances 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  including commissions 
the cvs operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and at our annual meeting of shareholders in may  the shareholders approved a proposal to change the name of the company from quest medical  inc to advanced neuromodulation systems  inc the name change became effective during june the company s trading symbol on the nasdaq stock market was changed from qmed to ansi on july  in june  we completed an agreement with sofamor danek group  inc sofamor danek under which we would develop and manufacture for sofamor danek  products and systems for use in deep brain stimulation dbs 
see note product development agreement of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received a payment of million upon execution of the agreement that is being recognized into income as revenue based upon the estimated completion of the development project 
during the year ended december   we recognized million into income as revenue 
in january  the agreement with sofamor danek was terminated in conjunction with the merger of sofamor danek and medtronic  inc in connection with the termination  we received an additional payment of million from sofamor danek  which will be recognized into income as revenue during the former agreement with sofamor danek fits with our strategy to strengthen and broaden our neuromodulation technology platforms and to find strategic partners to leverage ans core technology into other significant market segments beyond our focus on the pain management market 
we are evaluating potential strategic partners for dbs to replace the terminated relationship with sofamor danek  although there is no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating and consummating a new dbs agreement 
in august  we completed an agreement with tricumed medizintechnik gmbh  a german corporation  granting us exclusive rights to distribute tricumed s ce mark approved constant rate intrathecal drug pump and a future programmable rate intrathecal drug pump which tricumed is currently developing 
our distribution rights in international markets include the united states  canada  the united kingdom  france  spain  switzerland  south america  australia and other world markets 
we began distribution of the constant rate intrathecal pump internationally during january if tricumed is successful in developing the programmable rate intrathecal drug pump and obtaining the ce mark  we would also begin marketing such pump internationally 
we would also seek approval from the fda to initiate clinical studies in the united states  a necessary process to receive a pma approval to begin marketing in the united states 
in august  we completed an agreement to license exclusive worldwide rights to filed method patents for sacral nerve root stimulation aimed at relieving the effects of chronic pelvic pain including interstitial cystitis ic  an extremely painful bladder disease that affects an estimated  people worldwide 
we made a licensing payment of  upon executing the agreement and will pay up to an additional  in licensing payments upon certain regulatory approvals in and we have also agreed to pay a royalty on product sales used in sacral nerve root stimulation 
we believe our advanced radio frequency stimulation systems can be effective in treating pelvic pain indications including ic in february  we received conditional approval from the fda to initiate a pilot clinical study to evaluate the use of our advanced radio frequency stimulation systems to treat ic if the pilot study is successful  we would seek approval from the fda to initiate further clinical studies in the process to receive a pma approval to begin marketing in the united states 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and we reported net earnings of million or 
per diluted share in compared to  or 
per diluted share in the results included net earnings of million from the discontinued cvs operations or 
per diluted share primarily due to an after tax gain of million on the sale of the discontinued operations while the results included a loss of  or 
per diluted share from the discontinued operations 
net earnings from continuing operations increased to million or 
per diluted share in compared to  or 
per diluted share in total net revenue from continuing ans operations of million for the year ended december   was million  or percent  above the comparable level of million 
the period includes million of net revenue associated with our former development agreement for dbs products with sofamor danek 
net revenue from ans product sales increased percent to million during compared to million in this increase in net revenue from product sales was the result of higher unit sales volume of ans radio frequency stimulation systems used to treat complex pain patterns 
of the million increase in  million was the result of higher sales in the united states and the remainder from higher sales internationally 
we expect to launch our enhanced radio frequency stimulation systems in the united states market during the second quarter of our strategy is to expand our product offerings to all segments of the neuromodulation market and therefore we have increased our investment in research and development 
these development projects include an implantable pulse generator for spinal cord stimulation  an implantable pulse generator for deep brain stimulation and a low cost constant rate intrathecal drug pump 
our partner tricumed is also developing a programmable rate intrathecal drug pump 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue from product sales discussed above and an increase in gross profit margin 
gross profit margin from product sales increased to percent in compared to percent in due  for the most part  to a  expense during for the write off of ans inventory of previous designs 
excluding such write off in  gross profit margin remained approximately the same  percent in compared to percent in the period 
total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  marketing  amortization of intangibles and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and as a percentage of total net revenue increased to percent in from percent in research and development expense increased to million in  or percent of total net revenue  from  during  or percent of total net revenue  reflecting our stepped up commitment to develop products that will expand our presence into all market segments of the neuromodulation market 
this increase during compared to was the result of higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  increased consulting expense  and higher test material expense 
these expenditures during were directed toward development of our enhanced radio frequency stimulation systems which we expect to introduce to the us market in the second quarter of  a low cost constant rate intrathecal drug pump  an implantable pulse generator stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation and an implantable pulse generator system for deep brain stimulation 
we expect to complete the development of our implantable pulse generator stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation during the second quarter of and expect to seek fda approval in the third quarter of to initiate clinical trials in the united states 
we will also seek the ce mark european approval for the implantable pulse generator stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation during the second half of with market introduction expected internationally in the fourth quarter of we also expect to complete development of our low cost constant rate intrathecal drug pump during the third quarter of and expect to seek approval from the fda to initiate clinical trials at that time 
we are currently evaluating strategic partners to replace our former relationship with sofamor danek for deep brain stimulation 
marketing expense  as a percentage of total net revenue  decreased to percent in from percent in  while the dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commissions from increased product sales  higher training expense for new users of ans products and higher convention and promotional expense 
general and administrative expense increased from million during to million in and as a percentage of total net revenue  increased to percent in from percent during this increase in expense during was principally the result of increased legal expense related to the various development agreements discussed above  increased recruiting and relocation expense and increased costs for existing employee benefit plans 
amortization of ans intangibles increased from million in to million during  mostly due to an expense associated with a non compete agreement with the former president and chief executive officer 
other income increased to  in compared to an expense of  in primarily as a result of two factors 
first  interest expense decreased by  during compared to as a result of the repayment of short term notes payable in january from the proceeds of the sale of the cvs operations 
second  interest income increased by  in compared to due to higher funds available for investment due to the proceeds from the january sale of the cvs operations 
income tax expense from continuing operations increased to million in from  in due to higher earnings from ans operations 
this represents effective tax rates of percent in and percent in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  thus explaining the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of percent 
comparison of the years ended december  and we reported net earnings of  or 
per diluted share in compared to a net loss of  or 
per diluted share in the results included a net loss of  from the discontinued cvs operations or 
per diluted share while the results included a net loss of  or 
per diluted share from the discontinued operations 
net earnings from continuing operations increased to  or 
per diluted share in compared to  or 
per diluted share in total net revenue from continuing ans operations of million for the year ended december   was million  or percent  above the level for the comparable period of million 
this increase during was the result of higher unit sales volume  principally in the united states 
during and into the first quarter of  we dedicated significant engineering and marketing resources to build the infrastructure at ans and improve our current products to transform ans into an industry leader and compete effectively in the stimulation market 
we believe these measures account for the increase in net revenue during the period compared to the same period during gross profit from product sales increased during to million compared to million in as a percentage of net revenue  however  gross profit decreased to percent in compared to percent during this decrease in gross profit margin during was due  for the most part  to a  expense for the write off of ans inventory of previous designs 
as mentioned above  during we dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to improve the design and performance of our products 
due to the acceptance and superior performance of the current design of ans products  we decided that inventories of previous designs should be written off and recorded such expense during the second quarter of total operating expenses of million during increased slightly from the level of million  although as a percentage of total net revenue  such expenses decreased to percent during from percent in research and development expense decreased to  in  or percent of total net revenue  from million during  or percent of total net revenue 
this decrease during compared to was the result of lower salary and benefit expense from personnel reductions  lower consulting expense  and lower regulatory expense 
marketing expense  as a percentage of total net revenue  decreased to percent in from percent in  while the dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to additional expense related to higher commissions  clinical study and training expense for new users of ans products 
general and administrative expense decreased from million during to million in and as a percentage of total net revenue  decreased to percent in from percent during this decrease in expense during was principally the result of a charge during of  to write off an account receivable from a former ans distributor who filed bankruptcy 
amortization of ans intangibles increased from  in to million during  mostly due to patents acquired during february from the former owner of the stimulation business 
other expense increased to  in compared to  during as a result of three factors 
first  interest expense increased by  during compared to as a result of higher levels of borrowing and higher overall interest rates on borrowed money 
second  interest income declined by  during compared to as a result of lower funds available for investment combined with overall lower rates of return 
finally  during we realized gains of  on the sale of marketable securities compared to a loss of  during  a reduction of  income tax expense increased to  during from  in due to higher earnings from operations 
this represents effective tax rates of percent in and percent in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  thus explaining the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of percent 
liquidity and capital resources in the sale of assets of the cvs operations to atrion during january  we received cash proceeds of approximately million  after post closing adjustments as defined in the purchase agreement  which significantly enhanced our financial position 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds to retire all our short term notes payable and related expenses of the transaction 
at december  our working capital increased from million at year end to million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  during january  the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to  shares of the company s common stock and during august approved the repurchase of up to an additional  shares 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of  in january  we received the million payment in connection with the termination of the dbs agreement with sofamor danek 
during february  we completed the sale of our corporate facility to atrion for million 
after repayment of the mortgage debt and expenses related to the transaction  we realized net proceeds of million 
we expect capital expenditures during of approximately million 
of such expenditures  approximately million is budgeted for new furniture and equipment  computer systems  telephone system  manufacturing clean room and leasehold improvements for our relocation to our new leased facility in may the remaining expenditures primarily relate to manufacturing tooling and equipment for the new products we are developing and sacral nerve root patent licensing fees 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the termination payment from sofamor danek in january  net proceeds from the february sale of our corporate facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund all of our operating needs  including capital expenditures and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by continuing operations increased to million in compared to million in and a net use of cash during of  this improvement during compared to and reflects the improved operating results of ans  deferred revenue associated with the former agreement with sofamor danek and income taxes payable not due until march net cash provided by discontinued operations decreased to  in compared to  in and a net use of cash during of  the period included only one month of results until the sale in january net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net uses of cash in and of million and  respectively 
the period reflects net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of million 
we utilized million in for capital expenditures primarily for manufacturing tooling and equipment for the new products we are developing and  to license method patents for sacral nerve root stimulation 
primary uses of cash during were capital expenditures of million and payments to the former owner of the neurostimulation business relating to patents and settlements of million 
the primary use of cash during was for capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in and  in during  we received cash of  from the exercise of stock options while million was used for share repurchases and million to reduce debt 
during  we received cash of  from the exercise of stock options and million from additional borrowings under short term notes 
we used million during to repay debt 
during  the primary source of cash from financing activities was  from the exercise of stock options while we used cash to repay  of mortgage debt and  utilized in the redemption of the company s shareholder rights plan 
year the year issue results from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  manufacture products or engage in similar normal business activities 
we began our assessment of our computer software  hardware  manufacturing equipment and other non critical systems in early and are substantially complete 
the assessment determined that a significant portion of our computer hardware and software and manufacturing equipment were year compliant 
certain personal computers  non critical internal software programs and manufacturing equipment will need modifications or replacement and we expect the costs associated with the replacement and modifications to approximate  we estimate the costs incurred in the assessment of our systems to be under  which have been expensed in our current operations 
when we sold our facility to atrion on february   atrion also acquired our mainframe computer and software applications 
in moving to a new leased facility in may  we will purchase new computer hardware and software that is similar to our current systems 
we will also purchase a new telephone system 
we have received assurances from the providers of the new systems that they are year compliant 
we expect to spend approximately  for these new systems in addition to the  for modifications and replacements discussed above  which is included in the million we have budgeted for the relocation 
we will fund these costs from our current cash reserves and expect most of the costs will be capitalized 
when we relocate to our new facility and install our new computer hardware and software systems  we will test the systems to ensure compliance with year we expect to complete the testing by the end of the third quarter of we also plan to complete the modifications necessary to non critical software applications and manufacturing equipment by the end of the third quarter of we have contacted the third party vendors and suppliers of products and services that we consider critical to our operations to ascertain their level of year readiness 
we have no means of ensuring that all vendors and suppliers will be year compliant 
the inability of these parties to complete their year resolution process could materially impact us 
as a result  we will consider new business relationships with alternate providers of products and services as necessary and to the extent alternatives are available 
our plan to complete the year modifications is based upon management s best estimates and assumptions 
we cannot guarantee  however  that we will achieve these estimates  actual results could differ materially from those plans 
our goal is to ensure all critical systems and processes under our control remain operational 
however  because certain systems and processes may be linked with systems outside our control  we cannot assure you that all implementations will be successful 
as a result  we are developing a contingency plan to respond to any failures that may occur 
we do not expect the costs of our year project to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  any unanticipated failures by critical third party suppliers and vendors as well as our own failure to execute our year plan  could have a material adverse impact on the company 
outlook and uncertainties the following is a safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  plan  will  should  intend and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this annual report on form k and include statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations with respect to  among other things i trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations  ii our financing plans  and iii our business growth strategies 
we caution our readers that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following product development and market acceptance 
our growth depends in part on our ability to develop and gain market acceptance of new products  including next generation ans products 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop successful products  that delays in product introduction will not be experienced  or that once such products are introduced  the market will accept them 
year compliance 
we cannot assure you that our year readiness efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows since our compliance is dependent upon third parties also being year ready in a timely manner 
government regulation 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation  principally by the fda 
the regulatory process  especially as it relates to product approvals  can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
see item business government regulation 
single sourced components 
we rely on a single supplier for the computer chip used in two components of our stimulation systems 
the supplier of this computer chip has indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the computer chip in the future  but to date  has not determined when this will occur 
the supplier has agreed to notify us when a date has been determined and allow us to place a final one time purchase order for the computer chip 
in the interim  we are maintaining a higher than normal inventory of the computer chip 
in addition  we are developing a custom computer chip to replace the existing computer chip and expect such chip to be available during the first half of a sudden disruption in supply from the computer chip supplier or another single source supplier could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished products on time 
competition and technological change 
the medical device market is highly competitive 
we compete with many larger companies that have access to greater capital  research and development  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do 
in addition  our market is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid product development and technological change  which could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
intellectual property rights 
we rely in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
it may be necessary to defend these rights or to defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
cost pressures on medical technology 
the overall escalating cost of medical products and healthcare results in significant cost pressure 
third party payers are under intense pressure to challenge the prices charged for medical products and services 
we rely heavily on medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
any amendments to existing reimbursement rules and regulations which restrict or terminate the reimbursement eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of medical procedures using our products or the eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of our products could adversely impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential product liability 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical devices entail substantial risks of liability claims or product recalls 
reliance on customer distributor 
during  we had one major customer that accounted for percent or more of our net revenue 
sun medical  inc  a specialty distributor of our products  accounted for million  or percent  of our net revenue from product sales for the year ended december  while we believe our relations with sun medical are good  the loss of this or any other major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other uncertainties 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in this form k in specific contexts and in the company s other periodic sec filings 
the company is  of course  also subject to general economic risks  the risk of interruption in the source of supply  dependence on key personnel and other risks and uncertainties 
currency fluctuations substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our investments or debt instruments 
we invest our cash reserves in high quality short term liquid money market instruments with major financial institutions 
at december   we had  invested in money market funds 
the rate of interest earned on these investments will vary with overall market rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate earned on these investments would not have a material effect on our income or cash flows 
we also have certain investments in available for sale securities 
these investments primarily consist of real estate investment trusts and investment grade corporate preferred securities that are traded on the new york stock exchange 
the cost of these investments is  and had a fair value at december  of  the investments are subject to overall stock market and interest rate risk 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the share prices of these investments from the prices at december  would decrease the fair value by  the only debt instrument we had at december  was a mortgage note payable on our facility of  the note payable has a fixed rate with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
we repaid the note payable on february  when we sold the facility
