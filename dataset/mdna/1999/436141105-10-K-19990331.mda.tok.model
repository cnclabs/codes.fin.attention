com acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that in the effective tax rate will exceed 
liquidity and capital resources the company generates substantial operating cash flow because most of its revenue is received in cash 
the amount of cash generated from operations in significantly exceeded debt service requirements of the company long term obligations 
the capital expenditures including purchases of videocassette rental inventory of the company are primarily funded by the excess operating cash flow and through loans under a revolving line of credit 
the company has a million revolving line of credit available to address the timing of certain working capital and capital expenditure disbursements 
the company believes cash flow from operations  supplemented by the availability of a revolving line of credit  will provide the company with adequate liquidity and the capital necessary to achieve its planned expansion through at least at december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million 
videocassette rental inventories are accounted for as noncurrent assets under generally accepted accounting principles because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of the company s revenue  the classification of these assets as noncurrent excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of videocassette rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  the company believes working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of videocassette rental inventory as a noncurrent asset  the company may  from time to time  operate with a working capital deficit 
cash provided by operating activities during  net cash generated by operations was million higher than the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses combined with improved results of operations  excluding the impact of the non cash charges related to the inventory valuation charge and the write off of purchased in process research and development costs see results of operations  partially offset by a net unfavorable change in deferred income taxes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by million from the prior year primarily due to increased purchases of videocassette rental inventory for new and existing stores and an increase in investment in businesses acquired  partially offset by reduced capital expenditures with respect to new store construction  remodeling of certain existing stores and for the continued development of management information systems see capital expenditures 
the company paid approximately million in cash for reel 
com and approximately million for video stores  of which million was paid in cash and million was paid with a note payable see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company incurred a million non cash  pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of for a change in the method of amortization of its videocassette rental inventory see note of the consolidated financial statements 
cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million from the prior year primarily due to the issuance of million shares of the company s common stock in connection with the reel 
com acquisition for an aggregate amount of million see note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock for approximately million 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures include product for stores  store equipment and fixtures  remodeling a certain number of existing stores  implementing and upgrading office and store technology and opening for new store locations 
each new store opening requires initial capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  inventory  equipment and costs related to site location  lease negotiations and construction permits of million  excluding leasehold improvements that are customarily paid for by the property developer 
these capital expenditures will be funded primarily by cash generated from operations  supplemented by the availability of a senior revolving line of credit or other forms of equipment financing and or leasing  if necessary 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year to the extent that the company s software applications contain source code that is unable to interpret appropriately the upcoming calendar year and beyond  some level of modification or replacement of such applications will be necessary to avoid system failures and the temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
the company s year project group has been coordinating the company s year compliance efforts and has identified all computer based systems and applications including embedded systems the company uses in its operations that might not be year compliant 
the company is determining what modifications or replacements will be necessary to achieve compliance  implementing any necessary modifications and replacements  conducting tests necessary to verify that the modified systems are operational  and transitioning the compliant systems into the regular operations of the company 
the company estimates that these actions with respect to systems that we believe would have a material effect on the business are approximately three fourths complete 
the company estimates that all critical systems and applications will be year compliant by june  the year project group is also examining the company s relationship with certain key outside vendors and others with whom the company has significant business relationships to determine  to the extent practical  the degree of such outside parties year compliance 
the project group has begun testing procedures with certain vendors identified as having potential year compliance issues 
the company does not believe that its relationship with any third party is material to the company s operations and  therefore  does not believe that the failure of any particular third party to be year compliant would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that  if it  or any third party with whom the company has a significant business relationship  has a year related systems failure  the most significant impact would likely be the inability  with respect to a group of stores  to conduct operations due to a power failure  to deliver inventory in timely fashion  to receive certain products from vendors or to process electronically customer sales at store level 
the company does not anticipate that any such impact would be material to the company s liquidity or results of operations 
the year project group is establishing and implementing a contingency plan to provide for viable alternatives to ensure that the company s core business operations are able to continue in the event of a year related systems failure 
the company expects to have a comprehensive contingency plan established by june  the company estimates that it will incur approximately million  to address year compliance issues  which includes the estimated costs of all modifications  testing and consultant fees 
general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality the company anticipates that its business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
future operating results may be affected by various factors  including variations in the number and timing of new store openings  the performance of new or acquired stores  the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  the expense associated with the acquisition of new release titles  additional and existing competition  marketing programs  weather  special or unusual events and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
in addition  any concentration of new store openings and the related new store pre opening costs and other expenses associated with the opening of new stores near the end of a fiscal quarter could have an adverse effect on the financial results for that quarter and could  in certain circumstances  lead to fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
the video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
the company believes these seasonality trends will continue
