item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to the future financial performance of cygnus  inc 
cygnus or the company  and actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements  stockholders and investors should specifically consider the various factors identified under the caption risk factors contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events 
general cygnus is engaged in the development and manufacture of diagnostic and drug delivery systems  utilizing its proprietary technologies to satisfy unmet medical needs cost effectively 
the company s current efforts are primarily focused on two core areas a continuous and automatic glucose monitoring device the glucowatch system and transdermal drug delivery systems 
the company s product development efforts have been and are expected to continue to be either self funded  funded by licensees or distributors  or both 
in general  the company s agreements provide that cygnus will manufacture its products and receive manufacturing revenues from sales of these products to its licensees or distributors 
cygnus may also receive royalties based on certain of its licensees or distributors product sales 
in certain circumstances  the company may elect to license manufacturing rights for a product to its licensee in exchange for a technology transfer fee and or a higher royalty rate 
cygnus licensees and distributors generally have the right to abandon a product development effort at any time for any reason without significant penalty 
such cancellations may result in delays  suspension or abandonment of clinical testing  the preparation and processing of regulatory filings and product development and commercialization efforts 
licensees have exercised this right in the past  and there can be no assurance that current and future licensees or distributors will not exercise this right in the future 
if a licensee or distributor were to cease funding one of the company s products  cygnus would either self fund development efforts  identify and enter into an agreement with an alternative licensee or distributor or suspend further development work on the product 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  the company would be able to negotiate an agreement with an alternative licensee or distributor on acceptable terms 
since all payments to the company under its agreements following their execution are contingent on the occurrence of future events or sales levels  and the agreements are terminable by the licensee or distributor  no assurance can be given as to whether the company will receive any particular payment thereunder or as to the amount or timing of any such payment 
the company may choose to self fund certain research and development projects in order to exploit its technologies 
any increase in company sponsored research and development activities will have an immediate adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
however  should such company sponsored research and development activities result in a commercial product  the long term effect on the company s results of operations could be favorable 
in the past some of the company s licensees  distributors and collaborators have approached the company requesting modification of the terms of existing agreements 
the company is currently involved in discussions with several companies with regard to a collaboration for the marketing and distribution of the glucowatch monitor in the us and europe 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new collaborative arrangements 
for the company to remain competitive  it will need to develop  in license or acquire new diagnostic and drug delivery products 
furthermore  the company s ability to develop and commercialize products in the future will depend on its ability to enter into collaborative arrangements with additional licensees on favorable terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new collaborative arrangements on such terms  if at all 
the company s results of operations vary significantly from year to year and depend on  among other factors  the signing of new product development agreements and the timing of recognizing payment amounts specified thereunder  the timing of recognizing license or distribution fees and cost reimbursement payments made by pharmaceutical licensees  and the demand for its products 
up front and interim milestone payments from contracts are generally earned and recognized based on the percentage of actual efforts expended compared to total expected efforts during the development period for each contract 
however  contract revenues are not always aligned with the timing of related expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded contract revenue in any particular period and the company expects the same situation to continue for the next few years 
in addition  the level of revenues in any given period is not necessarily indicative of expected revenues in future periods 
in seventy six percent of revenues recognized by the company were attributable to four customers 
the company has incurred net losses each year since its inception and does not believe it will achieve profitability in at december   the company s accumulated deficit and net capital deficiency were approximately million and million  respectively 
results of operations comparison for the years ended december  and product revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  product revenue for the year ended december  resulted from the shipments of the fempatch system 
included in product revenue for the year ended december  are the initial shipments of the fempatch system and the final shipments of the nicotrol patch 
the reduction in total product revenue is primarily due to the discontinuation of shipments of the fempatch system 
due to the discontinuation of nicotrol patch manufacturing and the termination of the fempatch system supply agreement  the company does not expect any further product revenues until new products are commercialized 
the company does  however  expect to continue to receive royalty revenues from the manufacture and sale of the nicotrol patch by the company s licensee 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to commercialize any future products 
due to the above factors and the uncertainty regarding when and if additional products will obtain approval from the fda and when and if licensees will sell and market such products  the company believes that the level of product revenues experienced to date is not indicative of future results and may fluctuate from year to year 
contract revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflect labor and material cost reimbursements associated with the development of certain transdermal delivery systems and the amortization of milestone payments relating to certain transdermal delivery systems and the glucose monitoring device 
the decrease in contract revenues is primarily due to a one time payment of million received from pharmacia upjohn in june for the exercise of its option to purchase the us manufacturing rights for the nicotrol patch  a reduction in clinical billings related to one of the company s hormone replacement products and reduced milestone amortization related to the glucowatch monitor 
in february  the company entered into an agreement with becton dickinson company for the marketing and distribution of the glucowatch monitor  a continuous and automatic glucose monitoring device being developed by cygnus 
under the terms of the agreement  becton dickinson had exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution rights  with the exception of japan and korea 
the agreement was amended in june to grant becton dickinson worldwide marketing rights  with the exception of japan and korea  for the company s second generation glucose monitor 
cygnus retained primary responsibility for completing product development  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing 
in the first half of  cygnus received an up front  non refundable payment from becton dickinson 
on march   the company announced that the agreement it had with becton dickinson had been terminated 
consequently  the company will not receive any future milestone payments under the becton dickinson agreement and will not be obligated to share future revenue  if any  associated with commercialization of the glucowatch monitor 
the company is currently involved in discussions with several companies with regard to collaboration for the sales and distribution of the glucowatch monitor in the us and europe 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new collaborative arrangements 
in july  the company entered into an agreement with tokyo based yamanouchi for the marketing and distribution of the glucowatch monitor 
under the terms of this agreement  yamanouchi has exclusive marketing and distribution rights in japan and korea 
cygnus will have primary responsibility for completing product development and for manufacturing 
in the third quarter of  cygnus received an up front  non refundable payment from yamanouchi and is eligible to receive milestone payments as well as a percentage of the product s future commercial sales 
in july  the company also entered into a development and marketing agreement with yamanouchi for a day transdermal product to deliver a proprietary yamanouchi compound 
in july  yamanouchi discontinued the agreement related to the day transdermal product 
in  the company entered into an agreement with undisclosed company  for the development  supply and commercialization of a nicotine transdermal system  a smoking cessation patch being developed by cygnus 
under the terms of the agreement  the undisclosed company has marketing and distribution rights in certain territories 
cygnus has exclusive manufacturing and supply rights 
the undisclosed company has primary responsibility for obtaining regulatory approval and commercialization 
cygnus has received payment for manufacturing and development costs and will receive similar future payments 
the company is also eligible to receive future milestone payments as well as a percentage of the product s future commercial success 
in december  a nda was submitted to the fda and the european dossier has been submitted to the european authorities for the company s day estrogen patch 
in july  the company was notified by ahp  the licensee for two of the company s transdermal hormone replacement products  that ahp wanted to discuss the status of its agreement with the company 
cygnus was notified by ahp that it intended to exercise its right under the agreement to seek a sublicensee for these products and is now actively involved in doing so 
ahp and cygnus have negotiated an amendment to the agreement that provides cygnus immediate ownership of the regulatory filing packages for the two products and the right to co promote the two products as well 
the amendment also provides that if ahp is unable to sign an agreement with a sublicensee within six months  the rights to the two products will revert to cygnus and ahp will be obligated to continue development activities for the two products for an additional six months 
there can be no assurance that ahp will find a sublicensee 
furthermore  if ahp is unsuccessful in finding a sublicensee  it is uncertain what course of action the company will take with regard to these two products  although it is expected the company will seek a new collaboration for the distribution and marketing of the products 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be reasonably predicted 
the contributing factors to achieving contract revenues include  but are not limited to  future successes in finalizing new collaborative agreements  timely achievement of milestones under current contracts  and strategic decisions on self funding certain projects 
the company is unable to predict to what extent the termination of existing contracts by current partners  or new collaborative agreements  if any  will impact overall contract revenues in and subsequent future periods 
royalty and other revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the amounts include royalties from sales by pharmacia of the company s nicotine transdermal product in europe and canada  and by pharmacia s marketing partner in the us the net decrease in royalty and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to the launch in the us of the non prescription nicotrol patch 
the year ended december  included the recognition of previously deferred royalty payments associated with this launch  and a reimbursement payment from pharmacia relating to inventory and purchase commitments  whereas no such revenue was included in the period ended december  royalty revenue will fluctuate from period to period  since it is primarily based upon sales by the company s licensees 
the level of royalty income for a product also depends on various external factors  including the size of the market for the product  product pricing levels and the ability of the company s licensee to market the product 
therefore  the level of royalty revenue for any given period is not indicative of the expected royalty revenue for future periods 
costs of products sold for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  costs of products sold primarily include direct and indirect production  facility and personnel costs required to meet current and future anticipated production levels 
costs of products sold for the period ended december  include shipments of the fempatch system 
the decrease in costs of products sold for the period ended december  is primarily due to the reduced shipments of the fempatch system 
the company experienced negative product margins for the periods ended december  and december  due to low production volumes that prevented the company from absorbing all of its fixed manufacturing costs 
because the company is not currently manufacturing any commercial products  the company expects that fixed manufacturing costs will continue to result in negative product margins for the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to the increased costs associated with the glucowatch monitor and the autosensor in the following areas material  design and scale up for development efforts  and material and outside charges for the accelerated level of clinical activities 
research and development and clinical activities primarily include support and development for the glucose monitoring program  the company s hormone replacement therapy products and a contraception product 
cygnus does not anticipate an increase in its overall research and development expenses in marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses related to the glucowatch monitor  in particular marketing research expenses 
the company does not expect that marketing  general and administrative expenses will increase in arbitration settlement expense for the year ended december  of million represents a non recurring arbitration settlement expense with sanofi 
as of december   the company had accrued liabilities related to the arbitration settlement of million 
of the total accrued liability of million  million is long term 
under the terms of the settlement  cygnus i paid sanofi million in cash in january  ii will make royalty payments of between and of any and all net sales on its two hormone replacement products  which are subject to minimum payments in an aggregate amount equal to million  commencing in and ending in  whether or not any net sales of the two products have occurred  and iii issued  in december  a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of million  payable in full at the end of four years and bearing interest at per annum 
the note will be convertible into the company s common stock at sanofi s option  exercisable at any time during the four year term  at a conversion rate of per share 
interest income expense  net of interest and other expense for the year ended december   was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to the million non cash costs of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the october restructuring of the senior subordinated convertible notes  the interest expense associated with the subordinated convertible debt  the amortization of the financing fees related to this debt and the interest related to the additional long term debt incurred in the second quarter of these costs were offset by a net arbitration settlement with pharmacia upjohn from which cygnus received million 
comparison for the years ended december  and product revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  included in product revenue  for the year ended december   are initial shipments of the fempatch system 
the reduction in total product revenue resulted from the discontinuation of the nicotrol patch manufacturing in the first quarter of contract revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflect labor and material cost reimbursements associated with certain transdermal delivery systems and the amortization of milestone payments relating to certain transdermal delivery systems and the glucose monitoring device 
the increase in contract revenues is primarily due to a one time million payment from pharmacia for the exercise of its option to purchase the us manufacturing rights for the nicotrol patch 
royalty and other revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the amounts include royalties from sales by pharmacia of the company s nicotine transdermal product in europe and canada and by pharmacia s marketing partner in the us the net increase in royalty and other revenues is primarily due to the recognition of previously deferred royalty payments associated with the us over the counter sales of the nicotrol patch during the second half of and a million reimbursement payment from pharmacia relating to inventory and purchase commitments previously expensed by the company in costs of products sold for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  costs of products sold primarily include direct and indirect production  facility and personnel costs required to meet the production levels 
the decrease in costs of products sold largely reflects the reduction of direct expenses related to the nicotrol patch production as a result of pharmacia exercising its option to purchase the manufacturing rights of the nicotrol patch 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  include the initial shipments of the fempatch system  the company s second commercialized product 
the company experienced negative product margins for the year ended december  due to low production volumes which prevented the company from absorbing all of its fixed manufacturing costs 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  research and development and clinical activities primarily include the glucose monitoring development program  the support of the company s hormone replacement therapy products and a contraception product 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from decreased professional fees associated with the company s legal proceedings involving sanofi 
interest income  net of interest and other expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to higher interest expense associated with the company s june  million bank loan agreement for short term working capital 
in addition  interest income earned has decreased in conjunction with the decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance 
liquidity and capital resources overall  the cash  cash equivalents and investment balances as of december  totaled million  representing a decrease of million from the total as of december  at december   the company had a negative net worth of million 
through december  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from public offerings of its common stock 
in february  the company received net proceeds of approximately million net of issuance costs of approximately million from a direct public offering of its common stock 
through  the company financed approximately million of manufacturing and research equipment under capital loan and lease arrangements 
in the second quarter of  the company entered into a new loan agreement for million to finance additional capital equipment 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by specific company assets 
in april of  the company consolidated its two outstanding bank loans into an expanded credit facility with the same bank 
an additional million was borrowed  increasing the total outstanding under the new agreement to million 
in november of  the april agreement was further amended to modify the covenants 
this balance will be repaid through november  with monthly interest only payments through november and monthly principal and interest installments thereafter 
as of december  there is million outstanding under this agreement 
borrowings under this agreement are secured by specific company assets 
in february  the company entered into note purchase agreements with certain institutional investors to issue and sell approximately million of senior subordinated convertible notes due the notes 
on october   the company restructured the notes 
key provisions in the restructured notes include the october repayment of million in principal reducing the principal balance from million to million  a delay in the convertibility of the majority of the notes to june   modification of conversion prices of the notes  the ability of the company to redeem at par at any time all or part of the new principal amount of the notes  an increase in the interest rate to paid annually on the new principal balance and the change in the final maturity of the notes to october  see senior convertible notes part  item i 
through december   million of the first tranche of million was converted into equity 
in january  the remaining balance of million of the original first tranche of million was converted into equity 
in addition to the cash received from the public offerings  issuance of the notes  equipment lease and short term working capital financing  the company has been financing its operations primarily through revenues and interest income 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with net cash used of million for year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily due to the company s net loss of million and a million cash payment made in january to sanofi under the terms of the arbitration settlement  offset by the non cash beneficial conversion costs of million associated with the october restructuring of the notes  an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million  depreciation and amortization of million and amortization of debt issuance cost of million 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily due to the company s net loss of million  a decrease of million in deferred revenue  a decrease of million in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
this was offset by the million increase in sanofi obligations  decrease of million in accounts receivable  million of depreciation and amortization and an increase of million in deferred compensation and other long term liabilities 
the current level of cash used in operating activities is not necessarily indicative of the level of future cash usage 
the company expects a decrease in operating cash usage for primarily because the million payment in of the sanofi arbitration liability will not recur in net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from million in capital expenditures  offset by million in net maturity and sales of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  includes  as mentioned above  net proceeds of million and million from the company s february issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes and from a direct public offering of its common stock  respectively  additional stock proceeds of million and million from the issuance of long term debt  offset by a subordinated debt principal repayment of million  and long term debt and capital lease repayments of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  included million from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock  million of common stock issuance proceeds and million received from the company s capital equipment loan  offset by million in long term debt and capital lease repayments 
the company s long term capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the time required to obtain regulatory approvals  the resources that the company devotes to the development of self funded products  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  the ability of the company to obtain additional licensing arrangements and to manufacture products under those arrangements  the additional expenditures to support the manufacture of new products  if and when approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
as the company evaluates the progress of its development projects  in particular the glucowatch system  its commercialization plans and the lead time to set up manufacturing capabilities  cygnus may commence long term planning for another manufacturing site 
nevertheless  the company believes that such long term planning will not result in any material impact on cash flows and liquidity for based upon current expectations for operating losses and projected short term capital expenditures  the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of december   when coupled with cash from revenues and earnings from investments  will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through the end of however  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing  depending upon future business strategies  results of clinical trials and management decisions to accelerate certain research and development programs and other factors 
income taxes 
at december   the company had federal net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a substantial portion of the company s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
year compliance the company is preparing for the impact of the arrival of the year yk on its business  as well as on the businesses of its customers  suppliers and business partners 
the yk issue is a term used to describe the problems created by systems that are unable to accurately interpret dates after december  these problems are derived predominantly from the fact that many software programs have historically categorized the year in a two digit format 
the year issue creates potential risks for the company  including potential problems in the company s products as well as in the information technology it and non it systems that the company uses in its business operations 
the company may also be exposed to risks from third parties with whom the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own yk issues 
the company began its yk efforts early in by forming a project office chaired by the company s senior vice president of finance 
the board of directors is advised periodically on the status of the company s yk compliance program 
the project team developed a five phase approach to identifying and remediating yk issues 
these phases are awareness inventory assessment correction and testing implementation the company completed the awareness phase of the project in the third quarter of this phase consisted of meetings with company personnel educating them on the issues related to yk 
the meetings focused on internal systems  both it and non it  as well as external systems and relationships 
the company engaged the services of an outside yk consulting service to perform a comprehensive inventory of internal it and non it systems and applications 
the inventory was completed during the fourth quarter of concurrent with the inventory  the company s consultant performed an assessment of the systems and applications documented in the inventory 
the result of this independent assessment showed that the majority of the company s internal it systems were compliant 
this is due to the fact that the company does not rely on in house developed applications for its core business applications and therefore does not have legacy code to review and test 
the company s core business applications  accounts payable  accounts receivable  sales orders  and inventory control are supported by an application that has been certified by the supplier to be fully yk compliant and the compliance has been tested by the company 
the assessment did determine that the payroll application in use was non compliant 
this was upgraded to a compliant version in the first quarter of due to the regulatory requirements placed on the pharmaceutical and medical device industry by the fda  the company has placed appropriate attention on the non it systems 
for the company  this specifically covers all areas governed by current good manufacturing practice cgmp guidelines and include but are not limited to environmental monitoring control systems  laboratory instrumentation and their sub systems  production equipment  and materials handling equipment 
the assessment identified several of these non it systems to be non compliant 
the majority of these non compliant systems are laboratory instrumentation and their sub systems 
these systems are assessed to be non mission critical 
the company fully expects that these systems will be upgraded  replaced or have a contingency plan in place by january  concurrent with the inventory and assessment of internal systems and applications  the company identified several providers of products and services that are critical to its operations 
the company is working with these providers to ensure that these critical products and services are available for continued operations after january  at this time the company is not aware of any issues relating to these providers 
the correction and testing  as well as the implementation  phases of the company s yk compliance program are currently under way and are expected to be completed prior to january  the total cost associated with the company s yk remediation is not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the estimated total cost of the company s year remediation is not expected to exceed  through december   the company has spent approximately  in connection with yk issues 
the cost of implementing the replacement for the company s core business applications has not been included in this figure since the replacement of the previous applications was not accelerated due to yk issues 
all yk expenditures are made from the respective departments budgets 
although the company assesses its yk issue to be moderate to low  there can be no assurance that the company will be completely successful in its efforts to address yk issues 
having reasonably determined that the company s own hardware and software systems will be substantially yk compliant  management believes that the worst case scenarios would most likely involve simultaneous yk related disruptions from the company s key customers  suppliers  service providers and or other business partners 
for these worst case scenarios to have maximum adverse impact on the company  the vendors in question would either need to be sole source providers  or their peer companies  who would otherwise be potential second source suppliers  would also need to undergo similar yk related disruption 
the company believes that such simultaneous disruptions of the supply of basic goods and services due to yk related issues are unlikely to occur 
although the company has not yet developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if the company or any of the third parties upon which the company is dependent is unable to achieve yk readiness  the company s yk compliance program is ongoing and its ultimate scope  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available 
the foregoing yk discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements  including without limitation  anticipated costs and the dates by which the company expects to complete certain actions  are based on management s best current estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third parties and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability to identify and remediate all relevant it and non it systems  results of year testing  adequate resolution of yk issues by businesses and other third parties who are service providers  suppliers or customers of the company  unanticipated system costs  the adequacy of and ability to develop and implement contingency plans and similar uncertainties 
the forward looking statements made in the foregoing yk discussion speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
risk factors cygnus wishes to caution stockholders and investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  cygnus actual results and could cause cygnus actual consolidated results for  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of cygnus 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
history of operating losses  future capital requirements the company has a limited operating history upon which its prospects can be evaluated 
such prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device and drug delivery industry 
the company reported a net loss of million for the fourth quarter of and has experienced annual operating losses since inception 
the company expects to continue to incur operating losses at least until significant sales  if any  of the glucowatch monitor or the contraceptive patch which is in phase iii clinical trails and is currently in development with johnson johnson commence 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
the company has  and expects to have  fluctuations in quarterly results based on recognition of collaborative and contract revenues and expenses 
some of these fluctuations could be significant 
to date the company has generated limited revenues from product sales and does not have significant experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling its products 
there can be no assurance that the company s future development efforts will result in commercially viable products  that the company will be successful in introducing its products  or that required regulatory clearances or approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  or at all 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will ever gain market acceptance or that the company will continue to generate revenues or achieve profitability 
the company s revenues to date have been derived primarily from product development and licensing fees related to its products under development  as well as from manufacturing and royalty revenues from the nicotrol patch and the fempatch system 
the company will no longer receive manufacturing revenue from the nicotrol patch or the fempatch system 
the company will  however  continue to receive royalty payments for the nicotrol patch 
the company expects that a substantial portion of its future revenues will be derived  if regulatory approvals are obtained  from sales of the glucowatch monitor and other products currently under development 
the continued development of the company s products will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the research  preclinical development and clinical trials necessary to bring such products to market and to establish production and marketing capabilities 
the company may seek additional funding through public or private financings  including debt or equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
any additional equity financings may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictions on dividends and other restrictions on the company 
adequate funds  whether through financial markets or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  may not be available when needed or  if available  on terms acceptable to the company 
lack of sufficient additional funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and product development programs or to license others to commercialize products or technologies that the company would otherwise seek to develop itself 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  when coupled with cash from revenues and earnings from investments  will be sufficient to meet its operating expenses  dept repayment and capital expenditure requirements at least through the amounts and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing research and development  the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the rate at which operating losses are incurred  the execution of any development and licensing agreements with corporate partners  the company s development of products  the fda regulatory process and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
dependence on licensees  distributors and collaborative arrangements the company s business strategy for the development  clinical testing  regulatory approval  manufacturing and commercialization of its products depends  in large part  upon the company s ability to selectively enter into and maintain collaborative arrangements with licensees and distributors 
if the glucowatch monitor is commercialized  the company will be dependent upon yamanouchi pharmaceutical co  ltd 
for marketing and distribution of the glucowatch monitor in japan and korea 
the company does not currently have any marketing or distribution agreements for the glucowatch monitor other than the yamanouchi collaboration 
however  the company is currently involved in discussions with several companies with regard to the collaboration for the sales and distribution of the glucowatch monitor in the us and europe 
the company s licensees and distributors generally have the right to terminate a product development effort at any time prior to regulatory approval for any reason without significant penalty 
such cancellations may result in delays  suspension or abandonment of clinical testing  the preparation and processing of regulatory filings and product development and commercialization efforts 
licensees have exercised this right in the past  and there can be no assurance that current and future licensees or distributors will not exercise this right in the future 
since all payments to the company under its licensing and distribution agreements following their execution are contingent on the occurrence of future events or sales levels  and the agreements are terminable by the licensee or distributor  no assurance can be given as to whether the company will receive any particular payment thereunder or as to the amount or timing of any such payment 
in the past some of the company s licensees  distributors and collaborators have approached the company requesting modification of the terms of existing agreements 
if a licensee or distributor were to cease funding one of the company s products  cygnus would either self fund development efforts  identify and enter into an agreement with an alternative licensee or distributor  or suspend further development work on the product 
additionally  the company may choose to self fund certain research and development projects in order to exploit its technologies 
however  should such company sponsored research and development activities result in a commercial product  the long term effect on the company s results of operations could be favorable 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  the company would be able to negotiate an agreement with an alternative licensee or distributor on acceptable terms 
any increase in company sponsored research and development or sales and marketing activities will have an immediate adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
furthermore  the resources and attention a licensee or distributor devotes to a product are not within the company s control 
as a result  there may be delays in clinical testing  the preparation and processing of regulatory filings and commercialization efforts conducted by the company s licensees or distributors 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s licensees or distributors will not  for competitive reasons  support  directly or indirectly  a company or product that competes with the company s product that is the subject of its license or distributor agreement with the company 
furthermore  any dispute between the company and one of its licensees or distributors might require the company to initiate or defend against expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings 
any termination of any license or distributor arrangement by one of the company s licensees or distributors  any inability of a licensee or distributor to fund or otherwise satisfy its obligations under its arrangements with the company and any significant dispute with or breach of a contractual commitment by a licensee or distributor would likely require the company to seek and reach agreement with another licensee or distributor or to assume  to the extent possible and at its own expense  all the responsibilities being undertaken by the licensee or distributor

if the company were not able to find a replacement licensee or distributor  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to perform or fund the activities for which such licensee or distributor is currently responsible

there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into new collaborative arrangements on such terms  if at all 
additionally  there can be no assurance that existing or future collaborative arrangements will be successful 
any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations
