on january  the company acquired all the outstanding shares of wmi  a privately held company  in exchange for approximately  shares of the company s common stock valued on the transaction date at million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
wmi is a professional services firm with approximately employees located in oakland  california specializing in the design  the development and the implementation of document management systems for the semiconductor industry 
the acquisition of wmi is part of the company s strategic plan to add specific domain expertise in targeted vertical industries 
as of december   wmi had revenues of approximately million and gross assets of approximately million and the company believes this will have an immaterial effect on the company s financial statements as a whole 
the company recorded merger expenses of million in connection with the acquisition in the first quarter of on july   the company acquired all the outstanding shares of relevance  a privately held company  in exchange for consideration totaling approximately million  including  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
relevance was a development stage software company with approximately employees as of the date of the acquisition located in san francisco  california specializing in the development of content mining technology for unstructured information 
the acquisition of relevance represents a new market opportunity for documentum to develop additional applications for the sharing and applying of both corporate and web based knowledge

the company recorded million as a charge related to the write off of purchased in process research and development 
since inception  the company has invested significant resources in developing its software and related solutions  as well as building its sales  services  marketing  and general administrative organizations 
as a result  since inception the company s operating expenses have increased in absolute dollar amounts and are expected to continue to increase 
although the company has experienced significant revenue growth in recent years  the company does not believe that such growth rates are sustainable 
accordingly  the rate at which the company has grown in the past should not be considered to be indicative of future revenue growth  if any  or future operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will remain profitable on a quarterly basis 
see risk factors uncertainty of future operating results and fluctuations in quarterly operating results

during  the company has recognized revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition 
prior to  the company recognized revenues in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position no 
sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
the provisions of sop will be adopted for transactions entered into during the fiscal year beginning january  license revenues increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to in  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the growth in license revenues was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold  reflecting increased acceptance of the company s edms family of products  as well as an increase in the number of customers who purchased additional product licenses  and the expansion of the company s sales organization 
the decrease in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues is due to increased service revenue 
in  and license revenues from xerox and certain xerox affiliates  as systems integrators  a var and a distributor for the company s products  accounted for   and of total license revenues respectively 
the loss of a major customer or any reduction or delay in orders by such customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
also  the company s strategy to provide customers with whole solutions could result in software licenses being bundled with services 
therefore  with certain future transactions  the delivery of services may delay recognition of license revenue 
the company s first quarter revenues and earnings in any year are typically flat or lower as compared to the immediate preceding fourth quarter  due to seasonality  which the company believes is common in the software industry 
service revenues increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to million in  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in both service revenue dollars and in service revenue as a percent of total revenues was attributable to a larger installed base of customers receiving ongoing maintenance  training and support services and increases in the company s professional services staff in conjunction with the company s focus to expand the solution offerings to customers 
the company markets its products through its direct sales force and its indirect channel partners 
while historically  the company has generated the majority of its revenues from its direct sales force  the company has also focused on complementing its direct sales channel with indirect channels  consisting of systems integrators and distributors 
revenues from all indirect channel partners comprised   and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in indirect channel revenues as a percentage of license revenues was due to a rapid increase in the direct sales force during revenues from indirect partners for any period are subject to significant variations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of indirect revenues are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
international revenues represented   and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in international revenues as a percent of license revenues for the year ended december  was primarily due to the expansion of the company s sales force in europe 
the company classifies license revenue as domestic or international based upon the billing location of the customer 
in many instances  especially with large purchases from multinational companies  the customer has the right to deploy the licenses anywhere in the world 
thus  the percentages discussed herein represent where licenses were sold  and may or may not represent where the products are used 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of international revenues are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance

it also includes product costs such as packaging  documentation  production and freight 
royalties  which are paid to third parties for selected products  include both fixed fees and variable fees

at the date of acquisition  a technological feasible prototype of relevance s product did not exist 
the company has spent million in additional research and development during in an effort to further develop the technology to produce a commercially viable product 
at the date of acquisition  the only identifiable intangible assets acquired were the technology under development and the in place workforce 
accordingly  essentially all of the excess purchase price over net assets acquired  except for amounts assigned to net current assets  fixed assets and workforce in place  was assigned to in process research and development

to date  the company s international sales have been generally denominated in us dollars and the company has not engaged in hedging activities as the exposure to currency fluctuations has been insignificant 
in the future  as the company expands its international operations  the company expects to have an increased amount of non us dollar denominated contracts 
unexpected changes in the exchange rates for these foreign currencies could result in significant fluctuation in the foreign currency translation gains and losses in future periods 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for  and were   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for excludes the effects of the non deductible write off of in process research and development as a result of the acquisition of relevance and the non deductible items related to the acquisition of wmi 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will not increase significantly in liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of stock and through cash generated from operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk as of december  the company s investment portfolio includes million of short term corporate and municipal bonds which are subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates change prior to maturity 
the company maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances to typically hold its investments to maturity 
the remaining million of short term investments are held in short term securities bearing stated interest rates and are therefore subject to no interest rate risk 
an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
year readiness disclosure the company s state of readiness throughout the coming year  most companies will face a potentially serious information systems problem because many software application and operational programs may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could force computers to either shut down or provide incorrect data or information 
the company has commenced a comprehensive year project to identify the risks associated with its information systems  products  operations and infrastructure  suppliers and customers that are not year compliant  and in december established a year program office to manage the year project 
the year project consists of three phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  and if necessary  development  implementation  and testing of remediation and contingency plans 
all contingency planning is targeted for completion in july the year project is ongoing  and its phases are not sequential 
instead  as risks are identified  the assessment and remediation plans are begun 
the company is currently performing work in all three phases of the project 
during  the company identified two date processing issues in third party software that is embedded in its product line 
engineering efforts were made by the company to address those date processing issues  and technical fixes were made available 
in october of  the company released the edms suite of core products which included those fixes and which have been verified as yk compliant according to definitions posted on the company s web site 
the company is currently working with its customers who are not utilizing or implementing the edms products to identify and remediate any problems associated with the identified date processing issues 
the company has substantially completed its review of internal systems  and believes it has identified all mission critical problems 
during  the company plans to modify or replace any non compliant software  systems and equipment as part of a comprehensive infrastructure upgrade that coincides with the move of its headquarters facilities to a new location  which is targeted for completion in july further  the company is engaged in a comprehensive customer communications initiative in to ensure that all relevant year data is available to customers for their year planning 
finally  the company intends to create and manage detailed contingency plans for all third party suppliers that have not adequately responded to the vendor compliance surveys managed by the yk program office  and for all mission critical systems as part of its objective to ensure business continuity at the turn of the century 
the costs to address the company s year issues although the company will continue to prioritize resources in product engineering and internal business infrastructure groups to address year issues  those resources are allocated within the normal software development and infrastructure and facilities improvement processes of the company 
subsequently  no complete estimate of the expected total cost of this effort can be made at this time 
internally  the company has budgeted  in for incremental yk remediation to be performed preceding or during the move of its headquarters 
the costs related to yk have been immaterial to date 
the company is also engaged in a thorough risk assessment of all license and service agreements  and is in the process of contingency planning to address any issues that may arise 
the company has determined that a best estimate of unexpected costs is less than million for risks that are quantifiable at this time services  additional engineering  downtime for failure of local power grids or other mission critical systems  etc the risks of the company s year issues as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement or test remediation or contingency plans  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations  and become material 
in many cases  the company is relying on assurances from third parties  including vendors and partners  that new and upgraded information systems and other products will be year compliant 
possible losses from claims of breach of contract or warranty due to year non compliance of earlier versions of dctm s software cannot be reasonably estimated at this time  previous to the release of edms  date processing problems were discovered in two embedded oem third party vendors software 
a program is being initiated to address those problems for customers who cannot  for legitimate business reasons  update to the compliant release 
in addition  that program will also address custom applications  and installations that have been delivered by dctm s consulting services organization 
even if the company  in a timely manner  completes all of its assessments  identifies and tests remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
additionally  no estimate can be made at this time of possible losses from asserted and nonasserted claims of breach of contract or warranty due to year noncompliance  nor can any assurance be given that the year problem will not have an adverse impact on the company s operations  revenue  or earnings
