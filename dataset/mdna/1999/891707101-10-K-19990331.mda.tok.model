the company is party to interest rate swap contracts to hedge against interest rate exposures on certain floating rate indebtedness 
these contracts  which expire in november  have the effect of converting the floating rate interest related to a notional amount of million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility into fixed rate interest of approximately 
these interest rate swap contracts were entered into in order to balance the company s fixed rate and floating rate debt portfolios 
under these interest rate swaps  the company agrees with the other party to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
while the company is exposed to credit loss on its interest rate swap in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to such swap  management believes that such nonperfomance is unlikely to occur given the financial resources of the counterparty 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate contract in a notional amount of million in anticipation of financing that did not materialize 
accordingly  the company has adjusted the interest contract to market as of december  and the write down to fair value of approximately million and million  respectively  has been recorded as expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
subsequent to december   the company settled the million contract with a cash payment of approximately million 
in certain instances  the company is committed under existing agreements to supply product to its customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct costs to produce such parts 
the company is obligated to supply these products to its customers for the life of the related vehicles  three to ten years 
accordingly  the company recognizes losses at the time these losses are probable and reasonably estimable at an amount equal to the minimum amount necessary to fulfill its obligations to its customers 
the reserves established in connection with these recognized losses are reversed as the product is shipped to the customers 
such amounts reversed during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively

in connection with this agreement  the company paid million to proeza  with an additional amount of up to million payable based upon the net earnings of metalsa in  and the amount to be paid during the first quarter of related to the net earnings of metalsa in is approximately million 
the investment in metalsa was financed with proceeds from borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility

the notes are due on august  and are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share

the aggregate purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash and was financed with the proceeds from the offering and borrowings under the credit facility 
apc designs and manufactures frames  frame components  engine cradles  suspension components and modules for the north american automotive and heavy truck industries 
this acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  apc s assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date  with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
additional purchase liabilities recorded included approximately million for costs associated with the shutdown and consolidation of certain acquired facilities and million for general and payroll related costs primarily for planned employee termination activities 
at december   liabilities of approximately million for facility related costs and million in excess payroll costs remained on the consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with its may acquisition of msti  the company financed the cash portion of the purchase price through the issuance of two series of senior notes having an aggregate principal amount of million 
the senior notes were retired in connection with the offering and the new revolving credit facility described above 
in connection with the retirement  the company paid prepayment penalties and wrote off deferred financing costs which resulted in an extraordinary loss  net of income taxes  of approximately million 
on august   the company sold its hinge business the hinge business to dura automotive systems  inc for net proceeds of approximately million which approximated the book value of the net assets sold 
the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   the company generated million of cash from operations as compared to million cash provided by net income  depreciation and amortization of million in and million  was benefited by a decrease in working capital requirements of million in and was partially offset by an increase in working capital requirements of million in net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  as compared to billion in net capital expenditures totaled million in primarily for equipment and dedicated tooling purchases related to new or replacement programs with an additional million spent for the acquisitions of imar and oslamt  the investment in caterina and the additional consideration paid to mascotech during these cash uses were offset by million in proceeds from the sale of the hinge business 
this compares with net capital expenditures of million and million spent on the acquisitions of apc and simes and the investment in metalsa during net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared with million in approximately million of cash was provided through net borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of the preferred securities in june at december   the company had unused borrowing capacity of million  under its most restrictive debt covenant 
the company believes the borrowing availability under its credit agreement  together with funds generated by operations  should provide liquidity and capital resources to pursue its business strategy for the foreseeable future  with respect to working capital  capital expenditures  and other operating needs 
the company estimates its capital expenditures will approximate million 
under present conditions  management does not believe access to funds will restrict its ability to pursue its acquisition strategy 
effects of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
management believes that inflation has not significantly effected the company s business over the past months 
however  because selling prices generally cannot be increased until a model changeover  the effects of inflation must be offset by productivity improvements and volume from new business awards 
market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company s policy is not to enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company enters into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
at december   tower automotive had debt totaling million  interest rate swaps with a notional value of million and an interest rate cap agreement with a notional amount of million  which was settled subsequent to year end with a cash payment of approximately million 
interest rate swaps are entered into as a hedge of underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the debt instrument 
at december   the company s interest rate swap agreements convert outstanding floating rate debt to fixed rate debt for a period of time 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt  after giving effect to the interest rate swap  of million and variable rate debt of million 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a net increase to the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the pre tax earnings and cash flows impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately  holding other variables constant 
foreign currency transactions a portion of tower automotive s revenues was derived from manufacturing operations in europe 
the results of operations and financial position of the company s operations in europe are principally measured in its respective currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in europe are somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currency in which revenues are generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a portion of tower automotive s assets at december  is based in its foreign operations and is translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  the company s consolidated stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
the company s strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily upon conducting its operations in a country s respective currency and may  from time to time  engage in hedging programs intended to reduce the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year yk on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized and embedded systems 
any of the company s programs that have date sensitive software may recognize the year as rather than the year this could result in miscalculations  classification errors or system failures 
based on the information available to date  none of the company s products contain software or embedded date related logic 
therefore  the company does not anticipate any significant readiness problems with respect to its products 
most of the company s facilities have completed the inventory and assessment of their internal information technology it and non it systems including business  operating  facilities and factory floor systems 
much of the remediation required was completed during the remediation may include repair  replacement  upgrading or retirement of specific systems and components  with priorities based on a business risk assessment 
the company expects that remediation activities for its internal systems will be substantially completed during the second quarter of  and contingency plans  as needed  will be completed before the end of the company is currently assessing yk issues associated with its suppliers by working with the automotive industry action group aiag  an industry trade association 
as the critical supplier assessments are completed  the company will develop contingency plans  where feasible and needed  to address the risks which are identified 
although such plans have not been developed yet  they might include resourcing materials or building inventory banks 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario that the company currently anticipates with respect to yk is the failure of some of its suppliers  including utilities suppliers  to be ready 
this could cause a temporary interruption of materials or services that the company needs to make its products  which could result in delayed shipments to customers and lost sales and profits for the company 
the company has spent approximately million on yk activities to date and anticipates that it will incur additional future costs not to exceed million in total in addressing yk issues 
the outcome of the company s yk program is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which such as the availability of qualified personnel and the yk preparation of third parties are beyond its control 
therefore  there can be no assurances that the company will not incur material remediation costs beyond the above anticipated future costs  or that the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations will not be significantly impacted if yk problems with its systems  or with the products or systems of other parties with whom it does business  are not resolved in a timely manner
