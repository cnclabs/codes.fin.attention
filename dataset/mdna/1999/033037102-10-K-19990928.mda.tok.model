item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview in february  anchor completed its ipo of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
simultaneously with the closing of the ipo  anchor became the holding company for its current subsidiaries  anchor coin  colorado grande enterprises  inc  cg investments  inc  and d d stud  inc  each of which had been operated under different ownership structures controlled primarily by stanley e 
fulton  the chairman of the board 
also at the time of the ipo  the company acquired all of the beneficial ownership of global gaming products  llc and certain related assets from global distributors  inc the acquisition  which were primarily involved in the distribution of the proprietary game silver strike tm 
stanley e 
fulton also owned of global gaming products  llc prior to the acquisition 
the financial position and operating results of colorado grande enterprises  inc are included in the consolidated financial statements as an consolidated subsidiary 
on april   the company completed a secondary offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
million of these shares were sold by the company the secondary offering and the remaining  shares were sold by selling stockholders 
net proceeds to the company from the secondary offering were million 
on october   the company completed an offering of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
all of these shares were sold by selling stockholders 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the offering 
on june   the company completed the powerhouse acquisition pursuant to a merger agreement for approximately million plus powerhouse net debt of million 
the powerhouse acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and borrowing under a new million revolving credit facility 
anchor  through its acquisition of powerhouse and its operating units  vlc  awi and united tote  is now a supplier of system software  equipment and related services for on line lotteries  video lotteries  and pari mutuel systems throughout the world  and is a manufacturer and distributor of gaming devices for casinos 
the powerhouse acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
because the closing of the powerhouse acquisition occurred virtually concurrent with the end of the fiscal year of the company  the financial statements of the company for the year ended june  do not include any results of operations or cash flows for powerhouse 
the following table sets forth the percentage of anchor s total revenues attributable to proprietary games operations  gaming operations and route operations during the fiscal years ended june    and the growth in proprietary games revenue as a percentage of total revenues is attributable primarily to the commencement of the strategic alliance with igt during the second half of fiscal fiscal years ended june  sources of revenues proprietary games operations gaming operations route operations total revenues acquisition of powerhouse technologies  inc 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the acquisition of powerhouse technologies  shown on a pro forma basis  which may not be indicative of future performance of the combined companies  would have resulted in combined annual revenues of million  and net income of million for the year ended june  with the powerhouse subsidiaries addition  the company s proprietary games operations will be combined with powerhouse gaming machines and systems sales 
the gaming operations segment in the future will be comprised of a racetrack casino in new mexico  the company s existing colorado casinos  route operations in montana acquired from powerhouse and the existing nevada route operations 
the following unaudited financial information represents the financial results of powerhouse for the year ended june  year ended june  in thousands revenues lottery systems  gaming machines systems  gaming operations  pari mutuel systems  cost of revenue lottery systems  gaming machines and systems  gaming operations  pari mutuel systems  for the year ended june  powerhouse incurred approximately million in selling  general and administrative expense  million in research and development expense and million in depreciation and amortization expense 
these financial results may not be indicative of the results that may be obtained in the future 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year proprietary games operations revenues from proprietary games operations were million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily due to increased equity earnings in the company s joint venture alliance with igt  which  for accounting purposes  is recorded net of expense 
at june  there were more than  games  primarily wheel of fortune tm  operating within the joint venture  compared to more than  games at june  the increase in revenues is also due to increased revenues from the company s proprietary games cashball tm and safebuster tm 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased revenues generated from the wheel of gold tm  totem pole tm and clear winner tm games as well as decreased revenues from the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike tm 
the company expects the trend of decreased year over year revenue comparisons for wheel of gold tm  silver strike tm  clear winner tm and totem pole tm to continue due to the market maturity of these proprietary games 
these operations are also influenced by seasonal fluctuations as a result of weather and casino patron traffic patterns 
the company expects that these seasonal trends will continue in both the joint venture operations and the proprietary games operations outside of the joint venture 
in addition  changes in interest rates could have an effect on the earnings of the joint venture 
since jackpot expense is a function of the present value of future jackpot payments  future changes in the interest rate environment will affect the profitability of the joint venture 
specifically  decreases in interest rates will increase the then current period s jackpot expense of the joint venture while future increases in interest rates will decrease the then current period s jackpot expense of the joint venture 
during the year ended june   the company s installed base of stand alone proprietary games  without regard to its joint venture games or silver strike tm product  decreased from the year ended june  the average net win per unit for the installed base of stand alone proprietary games also decreased during the same period 
the company cannot predict to what extent  if any  these declining trends in its stand alone proprietary games business will continue 
during the quarter ended march   a bill sponsored by the nevada resort association came before the nevada legislature 
this bill attempted to define the conditions under which nevada gaming machine manufacturers would be required to sell gaming devices  to restrict the pricing and ability to participate in the revenues of such gaming machines  to regulate certain aspects of wide area progressive slot machine systems  and to force manufacturers to pay gaming taxes on their share of revenues 
the bill was later amended to provide increased regulatory review of wide area progressives  address market accessibility to games and to require manufacturers and casino operators to pay their proportionate share of state gaming taxes 
the amended bill excluded restrictions on manufacturer s required sales  pricing and participation in revenue of gaming machines 
the bill was signed into law before the may  legislative deadline 
the financial effects of this legislation will likely result in increased gaming tax expense associated with nevada revenues in the joint venture which will decrease the company s earnings from the joint venture and  to a lesser extent  will increase gaming tax expense in the company s stand alone proprietary games operations outside of the joint venture 
during fiscal year  the company received regulatory approval in nevada and several other jurisdictions  and placed in casinos on a limited basis  the first units of the conversion game tic tac disco tm 
this was the first title introduced under what is referred to by the company as the conversion opportunity 
the conversion opportunity is an anchor gaming operation that will be accounted for within the joint venture whereby anchor will upgrade existing  casino owned igt gaming machines in exchange for a portion of the future incremental revenue stream generated by the conversion 
this upgrade will generally take the form of placing a secondary bonusing type of event on or in the existing base unit 
tic tac disco tm was the first of several conversion titles  some mechanical and some video  that the company has in various stages of development and plans to introduce in the next twelve to eighteen months 
also during fiscal year  the company received regulatory approvals for two additional conversion titles  pick n pop tm and pick n kick tm 
the company recently received nevada regulatory approval for technology that enables the base slot machines to accept up to coins per wager 
this will provide the player with a multi line  multi coin spinning reel slot machine experience 
the company introduced this multi coin feature on the conversion platform during its september quarter 
the company cannot predict the level of success  if any  the conversion opportunity will provide 
the company does not expect significant revenue contributions from the conversion opportunity in fiscal costs of proprietary games revenues were million for the fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for the fiscal year proprietary games gross margin decreased slightly to during fiscal year from during fiscal year the increase in the cost of proprietary games revenues was due to primarily to increased machine parts used in the company s operations outside the joint venture  increased costs of production and service payroll and shipping and handling 
during fiscal year  the company engaged in extensive improvements and modifications to existing proprietary games in order to maintain performance levels of the games 
the costs associated with the upgrades and regular maintenance of games in operation are expensed as incurred 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased costs and expenses relating to the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike tm 
gaming operations total revenues from gaming operations were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increased slot revenues at the colorado central station casino and  to a lesser extent  increased slot revenues at the colorado grande casino 
the year over year increase in revenues was realized almost entirely during the first six months of fiscal year with the second six months of fiscal year resulting in flat year over year comparisons 
two casinos  both larger and containing more gaming devices  opened near the colorado central station as expected on june  and december   respectively 
the company is aware of other casino projects in various stages of planning in the black hawk central city market 
the company cannot predict the effect  if any  that the new or proposed casino openings will have on the company s colorado casino operations 
the company expects that the increased competition will have a continued negative effect on revenues as well as on costs of gaming operations such as promotions and costs related to retaining and recruiting employees 
historically  revenues and casino patronage in the colorado casino operations are highest in the summer months and those months unaffected by inclement weather 
the company expects this seasonal trend to continue 
costs of gaming operations revenue were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year gaming operations gross margin decreased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year in order to sustain year over year revenue levels despite increased competition  the company incurred increased marketing and personnel related costs 
although the company can not predict the effect of the new and proposed casino openings discussed above  management believes it is likely to increase both promotion and payroll costs in future periods 
the company expects to realize some decrease in costs of casino operations as a result of decreased gaming tax rates enacted by the state of colorado during fiscal route operations revenues from route operations were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year machines on route increased machines or to at june  from machines at june  average machines on route during fiscal increased or to from average machines in fiscal the increase in route revenue was due to the increased number of machines on route and increased performance of the machines on the route due to machine mix enhancements 
increases in route revenue were realized from both participation locations and space lease locations 
the company s primary base of route operations is in southern nevada where the population has experienced significant growth 
the company cannot predict whether this growth trend will continue or if increased competition from expanding grocery store chains and local casinos will lead back to the historical trend of generally flat year over year route revenues comparisons 
during fiscal year  several publicized quality of life issues surrounding route operations in nevada were settled in a manner acceptable to both anchor and certain governmental entities 
the slot route industry  including the company  will alcove slot machines in grocery stores  provide better ventilation for cigarette smoke  enhance enforcement of the supervision over minors near slot areas  and provide greater awareness of facilities for the treatment of problem gambling 
the company cannot predict the effect  if any  that potential future efforts by governmental or other agencies to limit or curtail slot route operations in nevada will have on the company s route operations 
the company recently received a termination letter from one of its major retail chains  due to a change in ownership 
as a result  the company will end its location agreement with four albertson s stores in september the company is the participant in an injunctive relief filed in court which would allow the company to continue to operate the locations as contracted 
the company believes that the loss of albertson s stores  if it occurs  will not have a material effect on the net financial results of the company s nevada route operations 
costs of route revenue were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year route operations gross margin decreased to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year the increase in route costs was primarily due to increased participation costs and  to a lesser extent  increased space lease costs  both related to increased locations and machines on route 
increased participation costs are also a result of increased competition in the slot route industry for locations 
other costs selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year the increase in sg a expenses is primarily due to increased expenses in the company s proprietary games operations of approximately million  including increased selling compensation costs  valuation allowances  and tax and licensing costs 
additional increases in costs and expenses were incurred for advertising in the gaming operations and for administrative payroll at the corporate level 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of  or from million for fiscal year the decrease is due to reduced expenses in fiscal year for development at the corporate level  offset to some extent by increases in the proprietary games operations 
the decrease in corporate development resulted primarily from reduced development costs related to the canadian charity based casino initiative that was cancelled by the ontario provincial government on june  in addition to the research and developments expenses reflected on the company s financial statements  research and development costs related to the anchor igt joint venture are accounted for on the books of the joint venture and are not included in the amounts disclosed as research and development in the company s financial statements 
acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal year was incurred in connection with the powerhouse acquisition 
this non recurring expense represents the value of the research and development projects that were in various stages of completion at the date of the acquisition 
there was no income tax benefit as a result of this expense  thereby increasing the company s effective tax rate for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense incurred in the company s proprietary games operations and  to a lesser extent  at the company s colorado central station casino and in the company s route operations due to the use of shortened lives for all gaming machines 
goodwill recorded as a result of the powerhouse acquisition is expected to add approximately million annually in amortization expense 
income from operations 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income from operations was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or from million for fiscal year excluding the million charge for acquired in process research and development  income from operations for fiscal year would have been million  a decrease of only million or from fiscal year as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations decreased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year other income expense 
interest income was million for fiscal year  an increase of  or from million for fiscal year ended the increase is due to increased short term investments resulting from higher average cash balances during the year 
other income decreased million from fiscal year this was primarily due to reduced net gains on asset disposals in fiscal year versus fiscal net income and earnings per share 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million or from million for fiscal year excluding the million charge for acquired in process research and development which had no associated income tax benefit  net income would have been million for fiscal year  a decrease of only million or from fiscal year diluted earnings per share of for fiscal year would have been exclusive of the million charge for acquired in process research and development  an increase of 
per share from the diluted earnings per share for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year proprietary games operations revenues from proprietary games operations were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year the increase is primarily due to increased equity earnings in the company s joint venture alliance with igt  which  for accounting purposes  is recorded net of expense 
at june  there were more than  games  primarily wheel of fortune tm  operating within the joint venture  compared to more than  games at june  this increase is also due to increased revenues from the company s proprietary games wheel of gold tm and totem pole tm  and to a lesser extent increased revenues from the proprietary games rock n reels tm and safebuster tm 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased revenues generated from the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike tm and decreased revenues generated from the proprietary game clear winner tm 
costs of proprietary games revenues were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year proprietary games gross margin increased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year the increase in costs of proprietary games revenue was due to increased machine parts  production and service payroll  shipping and handling  and production supplies  resulting primarily from increased machine conversions and maintenance 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreased costs relating to the sale of tokens for the proprietary game silver strike tm 
the increase in proprietary games gross margin is primarily due to equity in the income of the joint venture with igt  which  for accounting purposes  is recorded net of expenses 
additionally  revenues from the company s proprietary games  such as wheel of gold tm and totem pole tm  have greater gross margin percentages than the company s silver strike tm game  which previously accounted for a larger percentage of the company s proprietary games revenue 
gaming operations revenues from gaming operations were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increased slot revenues at the colorado central station casino and  to a lesser extent  increased slot revenues at the colorado grande casino 
the company s colorado casino operations were the beneficiary of mild weather during the six months ended june  costs of gaming operations revenue were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year gaming operations gross margin increased slightly to during fiscal year from during fiscal year the increase in costs of gaming operations revenue was primarily due to increased gaming taxes and promotions  and to a lesser extent direct payroll  at both of the company s colorado casinos 
route operations revenues from route operations were million for fiscal year  an increase of  or from million for fiscal year machines on route increased machines or to machines at june  from machines at june  average machines on route during fiscal increased average machines or to average machines from average machines during fiscal the increase in route revenue was due to the increased number of machines on route offset somewhat by increased competition due to expansion of grocery store chains and local casino operations 
costs of route operations revenue were million for fiscal  an increase of million or from million for fiscal route operations gross margin decreased to during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year the increase in costs of route revenue was primarily due to increased location costs and  to a lesser extent  increased direct payroll costs  both related to increased machines on route 
other costs sg a expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue of during fiscal year were comparable to during fiscal year the increase in sg a expenses is primarily due to increased expenses in the company s proprietary games operations of approximately million  including increased payroll and compensation costs  valuation allowances  as well as increased legal costs incurred at the holding company level 
research development expenses were million for fiscal year  which is comparable to the million for fiscal year the expenses were characterized by increased development costs in fiscal year at the corporate level primarily for the canadian charity based casino initiative that was cancelled by the ontario provincial government on june   offset by decreased expenses in the proprietary games operations 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expense incurred in the company s proprietary games operations and  to a lesser extent  increased depreciation and amortization expense incurred at the company s colorado central station casino 
income from operations 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income from operations was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year as a percentage of total revenues  income from operations increased to during fiscal year from during fiscal year other income expense 
interest income was million for fiscal year  a decrease of  or from million for fiscal year the decrease is due to decreased short term investments resulting from decreased cash balances during the year 
other income increased  to million in fiscal year from  in fiscal year due primarily to gains on disposal of assets 
net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income was million for fiscal year  an increase of million or from million for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
at june   the company maintained million in cash and equivalents  million in working capital  and million available under a revolving credit facility  compared with cash and equivalents at june  of million  working capital of million  and a million unsecured revolving bank line of credit 
pursuant to the acquisition of powerhouse technologies  inc  the company borrowed million on a new million unsecured credit facility 
amounts drawn on the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable margin or prime rate plus an applicable margin  at the company s option 
all borrowings under the credit facility are due on june  the company has agreed to maintain certain financial and non financial covenants customary with lending arrangements of this type 
the company has complied with the covenants throughout the term of the credit facility 
prior to obtaining financing for the powerhouse acquisition  anchor s principal sources of liquidity included cash flows from operations and the net proceeds from a secondary offering in april and an ipo in february net proceeds to the company from the secondary offering were million  and net proceeds from the ipo were million 
the company believes that cash provided by operations will remain as a significant source of cash flows  and anticipates that both operations and draws on the company s line of credit will provide the capital needed for continued business growth 
during fiscal year  operating activities provided million in cash flows on million in net income  compared with million in cash flows on million in net income during fiscal year comparable operating cash flows were attained in  despite lower net income  because included non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of approximately million compared with non cash expenses in of approximately million 
the significant non cash expenses in include the write off of million of acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of powerhouse technologies 
the cash associated with this expense was included in the cash paid for the acquisition of powerhouse 
capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the company spent million on capital acquisitions in addition to the million cash paid net of cash acquired for powerhouse technologies 
capital expenditures were primarily incurred for the purchase of gaming devices and equipment for use in the company s proprietary games operations 
in fiscal year  the company spent million on capital expenditures  also primarily related to the purchase of gaming devices and equipment for use in its proprietary games operations 
during the year ended june   powerhouse spent approximately million on capital expenditures  consisting primarily of expenditures to implement and upgrade on line lottery equipment used in the provision of services under long term contracts 
the company selectively pursues opportunities to win additional and retain existing on line wagering contracts 
if successful in obtaining new state lottery contracts  and depending on the size of the jurisdictions served  the company may be required to secure additional funding for the related capital expenditures 
the lottery systems segment operates in a capital intensive industry  in which wagering terminals  computer systems  and applications and communications software must be installed throughout a jurisdiction  often beginning up to one year before revenues are earned on the long term contract 
when a new jurisdiction is added to the company s customer base  capital required to obtain and install hardware and software can be significant 
generally  initial contract terms are from to years  often with to year extension options 
upon expiration of a contract and its extensions  the jurisdiction typically requires vendors to re bid their services and replace existing equipment with new terminals 
an incumbent vendor may have some benefit due to the communications infrastructure already in place  but most often  a significant portion of the initial capital expenditures must be replaced upon the re awarding of a lottery contract 
stock repurchase 
during fiscal year  million was expended to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to a board authorized stock repurchase plan 
in april  the board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to  shares of common stock 
the board of directors authorized additional repurchases of up to  shares in december and  shares in october as of june   the company had repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of million 
during fiscal   shares were repurchased at a cost of million  and  shares were repurchased during fiscal at a cost of million 
at june  there was a balance of  authorized shares remaining under the repurchase program 
working capital requirements 
in addition to cash requirements needed for the purchase and construction of capital equipment  working capital is necessary to finance customer receivables and inventory levels 
at june   notes receivable from customers totaled million  primarily resulting from gaming machine sales 
because management expects the continued growth of the gaming machines and systems segment  and intends to continue financing sales when advantageous to the company  notes receivable balances may increase 
financing gaming machine sales over short periods is common in the gaming machine sales industry  and most of the company s customer notes range from one to two years  with interest rates of up to 
certain international and domestic receivables have repayment periods of up to nine years 
the company continually seeks opportunities to expand its gaming oriented businesses in new and existing gaming jurisdictions 
if successful in pursuing another opportunity in any gaming oriented business and depending on the amount of funding required  the company may be required to obtain additional financing 
year in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive computer software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this  along with various other date related issues  is generally referred to as the year problem 
if this situation occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
as a result of the powerhouse acquisition  the company has acquired many additional computer and other systems that require review of their exposure to the year problem 
the company has integrated the powerhouse systems into their comprehensive plans to address the year problem 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer and other systems deemed to be date sensitive as well as those of its unconsolidated affiliates to assess its exposure to the year problem 
the company has identified and tested mission critical systems and is in the process of modifying or replacing those systems that are not  in its opinion  able to perform their essential functions after december  year compliant 
based upon the comprehensive review  management believes that the company s critical internal systems are year compliant or will be year compliant by september and other systems will be compliant by november however  if modifications are not made or not completed within an adequate time frame  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
in addition  the company has engaged outside consultants to assist and advise management in the review of its systems and evaluation of its readiness to deal with year problems 
the company has evaluated its obligations for communication to its customers 
the year readiness of its customers varies  and the company is encouraging its customers to evaluate and prepare their own systems 
in many cases  the company is assisting customers by providing new or modified systems to address the year problem 
in contractual arrangements where the company provides systems and equipment to customers  the company has scheduled replacement or modification to all identified systems that are not year compliant before the end of in addition  the company has communicated with its major vendors and suppliers to determine their state of readiness relative to the year problem and the company s exposure to third party year issues 
in some instances  vendors have not responded to the company s inquiries about year readiness 
in such instances where management has identified a material risk  the company has initiated further contact  developed contingency plans and made arrangements to replace the vendor 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that representations made to the company by third parties are in fact accurate 
as a result  the failure of a major vendor or supplier to adequately address their year problem could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
all costs related to the company s year problem are being expensed as incurred  while the cost of new hardware or software is being capitalized and amortized over its expected useful life 
the costs associated with year compliance have not been and are not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
specifically  as of june   the company has spent less than  and anticipates spending less than  thereafter 
these costs and estimated completion dates are based upon management s best estimates  as well as third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from these plans 
the company continues to attempt to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially and adversely affect its operations 
because many systems that could be affected by year problems are complex and interrelated  it is not possible to accurately predict all consequences of year problem related failures  including the quantity  severity  duration or financial consequences of such failures 
possible consequences that have been identified by management include the following operational inconveniences and inefficiencies that will divert management s time and attention  and the company s financial and human resources from ordinary business activities  routine business disputes and claims for pricing adjustments or penalties due to year problems by customers that will be resolved in the ordinary course of business  return of company equipment and termination of revenue streams due to perceived or actual equipment problems experienced by customers  and possible serious business disputes alleging failure to comply with terms of contracts resulting in litigation or termination of contracts 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address what it believes to be the most likely  reasonable  worst case scenario 
the company s contingency plan addresses mission critical systems  facilities and systems installed in customer locations and how the company plans to prepare and allocate human and equipment resources to remedy possible failures 
the company believes that the most likely reasonable worst case scenario would entail power outages and although the company has power generating equipment at its casino locations and local lottery operational facilities an extended power outage could affect the gaming operations and lottery operations 
the inability to accurately predict all possible effects of the year issue prevent the company s contingency plan from covering all possible scenarios 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the principal balance of floating rate debt at june   was  the company does not have any cash or cash equivalents at june  that are subject to market risk based on changes in interest rates 
the company does not currently hedge against any interest rate exposure 
the company  as a result of the powerhouse acquisition  is exposed to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as of june   the company had accounts and notes receivable denominated in canadian currency of million of total receivables and  of total receivables denominated in australian currency 
all foreign receivables are expected to be collected within months 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency exposures
