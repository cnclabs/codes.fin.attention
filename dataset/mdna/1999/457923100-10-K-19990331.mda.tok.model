the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report  including the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains certain statements  trend analysis and other information that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended  which may involve risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements including the words anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend and other similar expressions 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein due to numerous factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
overview the company was founded in to design and develop engineering test stations to test and measure complex electronic devices at the prototype stage 
the company was acquired by valid logic in and then by cadence in as a result of the merger of valid logic into cadence 
cadence operated the company as a separate subsidiary 
in july  the company successfully completed an initial public offering of common stock  yielding net proceeds to the company and cadence of million and million  respectively 
at december   cadence owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company  with the remaining publicly owned 
in february  the company completed a secondary public offering of its common stock  including  shares issued by the company  and  sold by cadence  yielding net proceeds to the company and cadence of million and million  respectively 
following the secondary public offering  cadence continues to own approximately of the company s common stock 
prior to  the company had been profitable for each of the previous ten years and had financed its business activities during that period principally through cash generated from its own operations 
the company s net sales increased from to at an annually compounded rate of  reflecting the company s successful introduction of test station and virtual test software products during these periods 
during  net sales declined from  as a result of a slowdown in orders from certain customers for the company s test station products 
this slowdown continued and was more pronounced during  driven primarily by an overall downturn in the economic cycle for companies in the semiconductor industry  many of which are long term customers of the company 
this resulted in a decrease in net sales of from to in september   the company acquired all of the assets of performic for a cash price of million 
performic  located in dresden  germany  is a developer of technologies aimed at addressing the engineering test needs of memory manufacturers 
a charge for acquired in process research development of is included in acquisition and restructuring costs in the accompanying statements of operations 
with this acquisition  the company opened its new european design center in dresden 
during the second half of  the company implemented a restructuring plan  including a reduction in the company s worldwide employee headcount by approximately  the termination of certain international distributor agreements  and the establishment of direct sales operations in europe and asia 
the primary objectives of the restructuring plan were to strengthen the company s international distribution channel  and to maintain acceptable operating expense levels as the company moves into the total nonrecurring acquisition and restructuring charges recorded in the latter part of amounted to million 
in addition to the acquired in process research and development expenses  the charges included million for inventories rendered obsolete by the performic acquisition  associated with the termination of certain international distributors  and for severance costs 
the sales trends and events discussed above  combined with moderate growth in operating expenses  resulted in net income of million and million for and  respectively  and a net loss of million for future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company and its competitors  the level and timing of shippable orders and backlog  the duration and severity of the economic downturn in asia  and the other business risks discussed herein 
there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that such growth will be sustained in future periods or that the company will return to profitability in the near future 
results of operations years ended december  and net sales 
net sales is comprised of systems sales including sales of engineering test stations  software sales including test station software and virtual test software and service sales  which consists primarily of revenue derived from maintenance and consulting contracts 
net sales of million for were million or lower than net sales of million for there is a close correlation between the company s sales and semiconductor industry capital spending 
the decline in net sales reflects the slowdown in capital spending for the company s test station systems by the company s customers during  as compared to many of the company s semiconductor manufacturing customers reduced  delayed or froze capital spending beginning in the second half of  due to a broad decline in business activity in the semiconductor industry 
systems sales decreased million or in  as compared to  primarily due to the slowdown in customer capital spending cited above 
software sales increased or in over  due primarily to an increased sales volume for virtual test software products 
sales of services declined million or during from  due primarily to the completion of certain virtual test consulting services contracts in late  which more than offset growth in the sale of systems maintenance contracts 
the company is not currently pursuing consulting services for its virtual test business 
international sales  as a percentage of the company s net sales  decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to much lower sales to customers in asia pacific  partially offset by a moderate improvement in net sales in europe 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of material  labor  manufacturing and service overhead as well as amortization of capitalized software development costs 
total cost of sales decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  systems cost of sales decreased from million for the year to million for  primarily due to lower sales volume and reductions in certain material costs 
partially offsetting these lower costs was a charge of million to write off certain inventories made obsolete as a result of the performic acquisition during as discussed above 
software cost of sales increased to during from for  reflecting costs for customization of certain virtual test software products sold during the first half of service and other cost of sales increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased costs associated with providing maintenance services to a growing installed base of the company s test station products 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin of million in decreased from million in  as a direct result of lower net sales and the million inventory adjustment related to the performic acquisition discussed above 
without this inventory adjustment  the company s gross margin would have decreased during from excluding the nonrecurring inventory adjustment related to the performic acquisition  gross margin decreased to of net sales for  from of net sales for  reflecting reduced gross margin from sales of services  partially offset by higher gross margin from sales of test stations 
the gross margin from sales of the company s test station systems  excluding the nonrecurring inventory adjustment related to the performic acquisition  was for  compared to for  reflecting reductions of certain material costs in software gross margin of for was down from in due primarily to the impact of costs of customization of certain software products sold during the first half of sales of services yielded gross margin of during  down from during due primarily to the completion of certain higher margin virtual test consulting contracts in research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering r d expenses consist primarily of employee costs  cost of material consumed  depreciation of equipment and engineering related costs 
r d expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in reported r d expense was principally attributable to increased capitalization of software development costs associated with development of the company s new vanguard test station and virtual test software products during gross r d spending  before capitalization of software development costs  increased from million during to million during  reflecting the cost associated with completing development of the vanguard test station product 
the first customer shipment of the vanguard occurred during the fourth quarter of capitalization of software development costs amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
capitalization of software development costs was offset by amortization of previously capitalized costs to cost of sales in the amount of and during and  respectively 
amortization is expected to increase during  as amounts capitalized related to the vanguard and certain virtual test products are now being amortized 
the company plans to increase the dollar amount of r d expense in the future  as investments in the development of the company s orion memory test station more than offset reductions in other areas resulting from implementation of the restructuring plan discussed above 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include salaries and commissions of sales  marketing and administrative personnel  and other marketing and general administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increased investment in the company s direct distribution channels  most notably in europe and japan  as well as increased distributor commissions for sales in regions not served by the company s direct sales organization 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  due partially to the increase in sg a  but primarily to the impact of much lower net sales discussed above 
other income  net 
other income  net includes interest income  interest expense and gain and loss on sale of assets 
other income  net decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease was due to the impact of lower average cash and investment balances on interest income 
income taxes 
the company s benefit from income taxes for reflects recognition of a portion of the benefit from net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company has recorded deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards of  against which it has recorded a valuation allowance of  as the probability of realizing these deferred tax assets in the future increases  the valuation allowance will be reduced appropriately 
any such reduction will have a positive impact on the company s effective tax 
the valuation allowance includes approximately million which  if reversed  would be recorded directly to shareholders equity in recognition of the tax benefits from deduction of employee gains on stock option exercises for tax return purposes 
the company s income tax position combines the effects of available tax benefits in certain countries where the company does business  benefits for available net operating loss carryforwards  and tax expense for subsidiaries with pre tax income 
years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the delay of orders anticipated from certain customers for the company s test station products into future periods 
systems sales decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   reflecting the shortfall in test station system sales 
software sales increased from million in to million in  due primarily to a increase in sales of virtual test software products  which was partially offset by a decline in sales of test station related software products 
service sales increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due principally to growth in sales of virtual test related services 
international sales  as a percentage of the company s net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due primarily to increased sales in europe and asia  and relatively weaker performance in north america 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december system cost of sales decreased from million for the year to million for  primarily due to lower systems sales volume and certain reductions in material costs 
software cost of sales decreased to for from for reflecting an increase in the mix of standard software products and a corresponding decrease in sales of higher cost custom developed software 
service cost of sales decreased from million in the year to million in this decrease was due primarily to a charge in the first quarter of for the company s change in accounting for spare parts  partially offset by increased labor costs associated with virtual test software related services 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december systems gross margin  as a percent of related sales  decreased from for to for  reflecting a slight decline in gross margin realized on sales of the company s test station products 
software gross margin  as a percent of related sales  exceeded in both and service gross margin  as a percent of related sales  increased from for to for  due primarily to the charge to cost of service sales in related to the change in accounting method for spare parts 
research  development and engineering 
r d expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in reported r d expense was principally attributable to greater capitalization of software development costs associated with development of the company s new products during while gross r d spending remained approximately flat from to the company capitalized certain software development costs relating to these activities in the amounts of million and in and  respectively 
capitalization of software development costs was offset by amortization of previously capitalized costs to product cost of sales in the amount of and during and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to higher commissions and increased investment in the company s selling function 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  due to the increase in sg a expenses combined with the impact of lower net sales discussed above 
following the company s secondary stock offering in february  cadence s ownership of the company s common stock dropped below 
this event required the company to recognize additional compensation expense of approximately during  as a result of payments made by cadence to certain company employees in respect of cadence stock options held by such employees 
other income  net 
other income  net increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the increase was due to interest income on higher average cash and investment balances  combined with the impact of a one time write off of expenses associated with the company s withdrawn secondary public stock offering in june  due to unfavorable capital market conditions at that time 
costs of the company s successful stock offering in february were charged as an offset to the offering proceeds in shareholders equity 
income taxes 
the company s effective rate for federal and state taxes was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the change in effective tax rates from to was primarily due to increased research and development tax credits earned during future operating results results of operations for the periods discussed above should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period  and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
like most high technology and high growth companies  the company faces certain business risks that could have adverse effects on the company s results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  sales to intel corporation represented approximately   and of the company s net sales  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales in   or sales of the company s products to intel and a limited number of other customers are expected to continue to account for a high percentage of net sales over the foreseeable future 
any sudden reduction or loss of orders from intel or any other major customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
like most high technology and high growth companies  the company faces certain business risks that could have adverse effects on the company s results of operations  including  but not limited to the following 
the company is dependent on high dollar customer orders  deriving a substantial portion of its net sales from the sale of test stations which typically range in price from million to million per unit and may be priced as high as million or more for a single unit 
a substantial amount of the company s net sales are typically realized in the last few days of each quarter 
during and  the company s quarterly net sales were negatively impacted by customer decisions to delay or cancel plans to place orders for the company s test station products in the last few days of the quarter 
the timing and sales price of a single order can have a significant impact on the company s net sales and results of operations for a particular period 
the company s net sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted if an order is received too late in a given period to permit product shipment and the recognition of revenue during that period 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed and planned expenditures are based  in part  on anticipated orders 
in addition  the need for continued expenditures for research  development and engineering makes it difficult to reduce expenses in a particular quarter if the company s sales goals for that quarter are not met 
the inability to reduce the company s expenses quickly enough to compensate for any revenue shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of any revenue shortfall on the company s results of operations 
the company purchases some key components from sole or single source vendors  for which alternative sources are not readily available 
a few of these suppliers are small independent companies and could expose the company to increased risk of temporary shortages for certain key components 
the company s future operating results and financial condition are also subject to influences driven by rapid technological changes  a highly competitive industry  a lengthy sales cycle  and the cyclical nature of general economic conditions 
during  approximately the company s net sales were to customers in the asia pacific region  compared to for these sales were predominantly to asian locations of us based multinational companies  but also included sales to companies headquartered in japan  korea  taiwan  and singapore 
the decline in sales to asian customers from to reflects the impact of the current financial crisis in the asia pacific region 
there can be no assurance that the asia pacific financial crisis will not have a further negative impact on the company s net sales 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company and by its competitors  industry acceptance of virtual test software  the level and timing of available shippable orders and backlog  and the business risks discussed above 
there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will grow or that such growth will be sustained in future periods or that the company will remain profitable in any future period 
year the company has developed its year readiness plan which includes steps to review  test and implement corrective measures for the company s products and information systems 
in addition  the company has identified its most critical vendors and suppliers  and is collecting sufficient information from each of them to monitor their year readiness 
to date  the company has completed testing of it s currently offered products 
based on these tests  the company believes them to be free of any problems associated with the year the company has tested selected earlier version products for year readiness  and believes them to be free of any problems associated with the year the company will continue to selectively perform year readiness testing on specific customer configurations as requested during the next several quarters 
based upon testing to date  the company does not believe additional product testing will result in the discovery of any materially adverse year readiness issues 
the company has completed review of its year readiness with respect to its information systems 
the review has not identified any significant information systems year issues beyond those that will be corrected through implementation of previously planned systems upgrades 
vendors for the company s information systems have represented those systems  with the planned upgrades  to be year compliant 
the company plans to test those systems for year readiness as the upgrades are implemented and expects to complete such testing by june  the company estimates the costs in  including payments to third parties and estimates of internal costs  for developing and implementing its year readiness plan were less than  the company expects additional implementation costs in to be less than  the company has not developed a most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
however  it is developing contingency plans in the event mission critical third party vendors or other significant third parties fail to adequately address year issues 
such plans principally involve identifying alternative vendors or  in the extreme  adding inventory safety stocks 
there can be no assurance that any such plans will fully mitigate any such failures or problems 
in addition  there are mission critical third parties  such as utilities  transportation and telecommunication companies where alternative arrangements or sources are limited or unavailable 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  and funds available under an existing bank line of credit of million 
since  the company has relied on cash generated from operations and cash raised through public stock offerings as its principal source of liquidity 
operating activities 
the company s net cash flows from operating activities includes cash received from customers  payments to suppliers  payments to employees and interest received and paid 
during  net cash used in operating activities amounted to million 
net cash provided by operating activities amounted to million and million for and  respectively 
a significant decline in revenues during a year where the company continued to invest heavily in both its research and development efforts and in its distribution capabilities led to a decline in cash flow from operations in other factors negatively impacting cash flow from operating activities during were increases in trade receivables and inventories 
the company s trade receivables  inventories and accounts payable have fluctuated from period to period as a result of the timing of shipments  cash collections and inventory receipts near period end 
the size and timing of a single customer shipment or collection can have a significant impact on trade receivables and inventories 
trade receivables increased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting the impact of extended payment terms taken by certain customers and distributors during the very sharp decline in industry capital spending is the primary cause of the extended payment terms 
inventories increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to additional parts inventories associated with the company s new vanguard and orion products  last time purchases of key components being discontinued by vendors  and the impact of the uncertainty in forecasting of systems sales volume and mix during investing activities 
capital equipment expenditures of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  were primarily for computers  software  demo equipment and engineering equipment used in the company s operations 
the increase in capital spending during was largely driven by investments in production equipment and tooling necessary to begin shipments of the company s vanguard test stations late in expenditures to increase the company s service spare parts pool were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the continuing investment in service spare parts reflects the stocking of parts for servicing the company s new test station products as they are introduced 
in addition  the company capitalized certain expenses associated with software development costs of million  million and for  and  respectively 
the increase in reflects the investment in software technology associated with the company s new vanguard test stations and its virtual test software 
financing activities 
in and  net cash used in financing activities was and  respectively 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million 
in may  the company announced a plan to repurchase up to  shares of its currently outstanding common stock over months in open market and negotiated transactions 
this repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of shares in increments in accordance with sec regulations and board of directors guidance 
as of december   this program had resulted in the repurchase of  shares at a total cost of million 
this program may continue in future periods  subject to authorization by the board of directors 
cash used for payments of certain capital leases obtained by the company for computers and equipment used in operations was  and for  and  respectively 
the company received  million and  in  and  respectively  from the issuance of stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
cash provided by financing activities during was attributable to proceeds of million from the company s secondary public offering of common stock 
during and  the company realized reductions in current income tax liabilities of million and million  respectively  resulting from the benefit of tax deductions of employee gains upon exercise of cadence stock options  and to a lesser extent from the exercise of the company s employee stock options 
during  no such benefits were recorded as a result of the company s pre tax loss before deduction of such benefits 
had the company generated sufficient pre tax income during  the tax benefits which would have been realized as a result of deduction of employee stock option gains would have amounted to approximately million 
for  these deductions increased the company s net operating loss carryforward for tax return purposes 
if and when the company generates sufficient pre tax income in the future  the benefit of the carryforward deduction of these option exercises will reduce the amount of cash otherwise required for income tax payments 
the compensation for tax purposes associated with stock option exercises and with disqualifying dispositions are typically not treated as expenses of the company for financial reporting purposes  and the exercise of cadence stock options does not increase the number of shares of company common stock outstanding 
the tax benefits available from the stock option deduction will decrease in the future as employee holdings of cadence stock options decline due to option exercises and cancellations 
the timing and magnitude of this decrease in tax benefits is uncertain as the number of employee stock options which are exercised  and the amount of gains realized upon exercise  will be determined by  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of cadence common stock 
at the end of  the company secured a million revolving line of credit with us national bank of oregon  which is available for general corporate purposes as needed 
under the agreement  the company can borrow  with interest at the bank s prime lending rate  or if lower  at certain margins above banker s acceptance or interbank offering rates 
there have been no borrowings against the line of credit to date 
the term of the current credit line agreement ends april  management intends to renew the agreement at that time 
the company believes that existing funds  funds expected to be generated by operating activities  and the available line of credit  will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and other general corporate purposes through at least the next twelve months 
the company currently has no significant capital commitments other than commitments under facility operating leases and vendor contracts for development services  consulting services and parts 
from time to time  the company may consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
the company presently has no significant understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
any such transactions  if consummated  may require additional financing 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company
