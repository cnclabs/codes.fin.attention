item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  related notes thereto  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are the second largest provider of electrical contracting services in the united states 
we began operations on january  with the acquisition of electrical businesses and through september   we have acquired additional electrical and cabling contracting businesses 
we refer to the additional electrical and cabling contracting businesses acquired since january  as our acquired companies 
we serve a broad range of markets  including commercial  industrial  residential  information technology  and power line markets 
our revenues are generated from a mix of new construction  renovation  maintenance  and specialized services 
we also focus on higher margin  larger projects that require special expertise  including design and build projects that utilize the capabilities of our in house engineers  service  maintenance  and renovation and upgrade work 
we believe our service  maintenance and renovation and upgrade revenues tend to either be recurring  have lower sensitivity to economic cycles  or both 
our financial statements for the periods prior to january   reflect the historical results of houston stafford as the accounting acquirer as restated to include the financial position and results of operations of one acquired company that was acquired in a pooling of interests transaction in june the operations of the other founding companies  ies and the other acquired companies have been included in our historical financial statements beginning on their respective dates of acquisition 
our revenues are derived primarily from electrical and cabling construction and maintenance services provided to commercial  industrial  residential  information technology and power line market 
revenues from fixed price construction and renovation contracts are generally accounted for on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method 
the cost to cost method measures the percentage completion of a contract based on total costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs at completion 
these contracts generally provide that the customers accept completion of progress to date and pay us for services rendered measured in terms of hours expended or some other measure of progress 
some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon the execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work to be performed 
our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions that allow the customer to withhold up to ten percent from each payment during the course of a job and forward all retained amounts to us upon completion and approval of the work 
maintenance and other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
cost of services consists primarily of salaries and benefits of employees  subcontracted services  materials  parts and supplies  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses  and equipment rentals 
our gross margin  which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues  depends on the relative proportion of costs related to labor and materials 
on jobs in which a higher percentage of the cost of services consists of labor costs  we typically achieve higher gross margins than on jobs where materials represent more of the cost of services 
materials costs can be calculated with relatively greater accuracy than labor costs  and we seek to maintain higher margins on our labor intensive projects to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs for these projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative salaries and benefits  marketing expenses  office rent and utilities  and similar administrative expenses 
we believe that we have realized savings from consolidation of insurance and bonding programs  our ability to borrow at lower interest rates than the individual companies  consolidation of operations in some locations  and greater volume discounts from suppliers of materials  parts  supplies and services 
offsetting these savings are costs related to our corporate management  costs of being a public company  and costs of integrating acquired companies 
as a result of the acquisitions of the acquired companies and the founding companies that were accounted for as purchases  the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill on our balance sheet and is being amortized as a noncash charge to the statement of operations over a year period 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments which could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term obligations under our credit facility and our senior subordinated notes  of which million and million was outstanding at september   respectively 
the credit facility matures on july   and the senior subordinated notes mature on february  results of operations the following table presents selected historical results of operations of ies and subsidiaries  with dollar amounts in thousands 
these historical statements of operations represent the results of operations of i houston stafford as restated to include the results of operations of one acquired company that was acquired in a pooling of interests transaction for periods ending prior to january  and ii houston stafford as restated and the results of operations of the founding companies and other acquired companies beginning on their respective dates of acquisition

gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended september   to million for the year ended september  this increase in gross profit was principally due to acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit remained constant at 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily related to inclusion of expenses of the acquired companies 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in during the four months ended january a million bonus was paid to the previous owners of houston stafford  which bonus was not paid during the year ended september  corporate costs associated with being a public company totaled approximately million during the year ended september   compared to approximately million during the year ended september  this increase is related to building infrastructure necessary to manage our operations 
income from operations increased million  or  from million for the year ended september   to million for the year ended september  this increase in income from operations was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the acquired companies and the elimination of the million non cash  non recurring compensation charge incurred in connection with our ipo see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by the higher corporate costs discussed above 
interest and other income expense  net changed from expense of million in to million in  primarily as a result of interest expense  payable on our senior subordinated notes due and our credit facility 
the increase in our tax provision from million in to million in is primarily attributable to the growth in income from operations discussed above 
year ended september  compared to the year ended september  revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the increase in revenues was principally due to the acquisition of the founding companies and the acquired companies 
gross profit increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the increase in gross profit was principally due to the acquisition of the founding companies and the acquired companies 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased from in to in this increase was attributable primarily to houston stafford s lower margin on certain material purchases and higher than normal levels of overtime in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues remained constant at approximately in and selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily attributable to the acquisitions of the founding companies and the acquired companies  a million bonus paid to the owners of houston stafford during the four months ended in january  compared to a million bonus during the four months ended in january  and approximately million of public company related corporate costs incurred in which did not exist in excluding such bonuses and higher corporate costs  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in income from operations increased million  or  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  this increase in operating income was primarily attributable to acquisition of the founding companies and the acquired companies and the non recurring owner bonuses in these increases were partially offset by the higher corporate costs discussed above and the million non cash  non recurring compensation charge incurred in connection with the company s ipo see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of revenues  income from operations excluding the owner bonuses  higher corporate costs and the non cash  non recurring compensation charge noted above increased from in to in interest and other income expense  net changed from income of million in to million expense in  primarily as a result of interest expense on borrowings to fund the company s acquisitions 
the increase in the company s tax provision from million in to million in is primarily attributed to the growth in income from operations discussed above 
the company s effective tax rate increased from in to in  due to a million non cash  non recurring compensation charge recognized during in connection with the ipo which is not deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million  borrowings of million under our three year revolving credit facility the credit facility  million of letters of credit outstanding  and available capacity under our credit facility of million 
during the year ended september   we used million of net cash from operating activities  comprised of net income of million  increased by million of non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization expense  decreased by a million increase in receivables as a result of revenue growth and the timing of collections and further decreased by a million increase in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts in excess of billings related to the timing of billings  with the balance of the change due to other working capital changes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  including million used for the purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired  and million of capital expenditures 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was million  resulting primarily from our offering of million senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes  net of borrowings under our credit facility and reduced by paydowns on debt acquired in connection with the purchase of businesses discussed above 
our credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million  to be used for working capital  capital expenditures  other corporate purposes and acquisitions 
the amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to either libor plus to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda  or the higher of the bank s prime rate  and the federal funds rate plus  plus up to an additional as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
at september   the weighted average interest rate was 
commitment fees of to  as determined by the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda  are due on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of all amounts due under the facility  and the facility is secured by the capital stock of the guarantors and the accounts receivable of ies and the guarantors 
the credit facility requires the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a set level of cash consideration  prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock  restricts our ability to incur other indebtedness  and requires us to comply with material financial covenants 
availability of the credit facility is subject to customary drawing conditions 
on january   we completed our offering of the million senior subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at and will mature on february  interest is payable on the notes semiannually on february and august we made the first of such payments on august  the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all our existing and future senior indebtedness 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of our subsidiaries 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and restrictions on liens  guarantees and dividends 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and proceeds from the credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment through fiscal during the fiscal year ended september   we acquired additional electrical contracting and cabling businesses for approximately million in cash and million shares of common stock 
the cash component of the consideration paid for these companies was funded with existing cash  borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from the offering of our senior subordinated notes 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities 
we may be in various stages of negotiation  due diligence and documentation of potential acquisitions at any time 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future acquisitions primarily with working capital  cash flow from operations and borrowings  including any unborrowed portion of the credit facility  as well as issuances of additional equity or debt 
to the extent we fund a significant portion of the consideration for future acquisitions with cash  we may have to increase the amount available for borrowing under our credit facility or obtain other sources of financing through the public or private sale of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such financing if and when it is needed or on terms we consider acceptable 
if we are unable to secure acceptable financing  our acquisition program could be negatively affected 
we expect capital expenditures for equipment and expansion of facilities to be funded from cash flow from operations and supplemented as necessary by borrowings under our credit facility 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our results of operations from residential construction are seasonal  depending on weather trends  with typically higher revenues generated during the spring and summer and lower revenues during the fall and winter 
the commercial and industrial aspect of our business is less subject to seasonal trends  as this work generally is performed inside structures protected from the weather  however  it may be affected by severe weather conditions such as flooding 
our service business is generally not affected by seasonality 
in addition  the construction industry has historically been highly cyclical 
our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in construction projects resulting from adverse regional or national economic conditions 
quarterly results may also be materially affected by the timing of new construction projects and acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period 
inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation experienced in fiscal  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results in those fiscal years  or on any of the founding companies or the acquired companies during similar periods 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
becomes effective for us for our year ended september  sfas no 
requires a company to recognize all derivative instruments including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts as assets or liabilities in its balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized as current earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we are evaluating sfas no 
and the impact on existing accounting policies and financial reporting disclosures 
however  we have not to date engaged in activities or entered into arrangements normally associated with derivative instruments 
year year issue 
many software applications  hardware and equipment and embedded chip systems identify dates using only the last two digits of the year 
these products may be unable to distinguish between dates in the year and dates in the year that inability referred to as the year issue  if not addressed  could cause applications  equipment or systems to fail or provide incorrect information after december   or when using dates after december  this in turn could have an adverse effect on us due to the direct dependence on our own applications  equipment and systems and indirect dependence on those of other entities with which we must interact 
risk of non compliance and contingency plans 
the major applications which pose the greatest year risks for us if implementation of the year compliance program is not successful are our financial systems applications  including related third party software 
potential problems if our year compliance program is not successful could include disruptions of our revenue invoicing and collection from our customers and purchasing and payments to our vendors and the inability to perform our other financial and accounting functions 
we operate on a decentralized basis with each individual reporting unit having independent information technology it and non it systems 
our year compliance program is focused on the systems which could materially affect our business 
we have completed substantially all of our remediation and testing of our significant operating units to date and believe that the material systems at our companies are or will be year compliant 
we currently have assessed our remaining year risk as low because we are not dependent on any key customers or suppliers none represent as much as of the companies sales or purchases  respectfully  we have many separate pc based systems which are not dependent on any one system  many of our processes are performed using spreadsheets and or other manual processes which are not technologically dependent  and we perform construction and service maintenance on site for our customers  the work performed is manual in nature and not dependent on automated information technology systems to be completed 
as a result  we believe that our reasonably likely worst case year scenario is a temporary inability for us to process the accounting transactions representing our business activity using automated information systems at certain of our operating units 
the goal of our year project is to ensure that all of the critical systems and processes under our direct control remain functional 
however  because certain systems and processes may be interrelated with systems outside of our control  there can be no assurance that all implementations will be successful 
accordingly  as part of our year project  contingency and business plans have been developed to respond to potential failures that may occur 
to the extent appropriate  such plans include emergency back up and recovery procedures  remediation of existing systems with system upgrades or installation of new systems and replacing electronic applications with manual processes 
due to the uncertain nature of contingency planning  there can be no assurances that such plans actually will be sufficient to reduce the risk of material impacts on our operations due to year issues 
we have ongoing information systems development and implementation projects  none of which have experienced delays due to our year compliance program 
compliance program 
in order to address the year issue  we established a project team to assure that key automated accounting systems and related processes will remain functional through year the team addressed the project in the following stages i awareness  ii assessment  iii remediation  iv implementation and v testing of the necessary modifications 
the key automated systems consist of a project estimating  management and financial systems applications  b supporting hardware and equipment and c third party developed software 
the evaluation of our year issue includes the evaluation of the year exposure of third parties material to our operations 
we have retained a year consulting firm to manage  direct and assist with the year compliance program 
company state of readiness 
we have completed substantially all phases of our year project that began with a corporate wide awareness program which will continue to be updated throughout the life of the project 
we believe that there is not a material risk related to our non it systems because we are primarily a manual service provider and do not rely on these types of systems 
the assessment phase of the project involves for both it and non it systems  among other things  efforts to obtain representations and assurances from third parties  including third party vendors  that their hardware and equipment  embedded chip systems and software being used by or impacting us or any of our business units are or will be modified to be year compliant 
to date  most responses from such third parties have been conclusive 
however  because we are not dependent on any key customers or suppliers  we do not believe that a disruption in service with any third party would have a material  adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the remediation phase involves identifying the changes which are required to be implemented by the systems to be year compliant 
the testing and implementation phases involve verifying that changes address the year problems identified through testing the system as part of implementing such changes 
substantially all phases  including testing and certification  have been completed 
however  a small number of subsidiaries will complete their testing and certification by december  costs to address year compliance issues 
the costs incurred in associated with the assessing and testing applications  hardware and equipment  and third party developed software which were funded with existing operating cash flows and were deducted from income as incurred 
to date  we have expended approximately  related to our year compliance 
these costs were primarily related to the assessment  remediation and implementation phases of the project 
we do not expect the remaining costs of the year project to exceed  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
therefore  our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our short term and long term debt  with both fixed and floating interest rates 
our debt with fixed interest rates primarily consists of the senior subordinated notes 
our debt with variable interest rates is primarily the credit facility 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at september  thereafter total liabilities long term debt variable rate   average interest rate fixed rate   average interest rate fair total value liabilities long term debt variable rate   fixed rate
