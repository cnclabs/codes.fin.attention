the company s business is highly seasonal 
the company believes that a significant percentage of certain of its products  particularly the dirt devil r hand vac  dirt devil r broom vac r  and dirt devil r mop vac r  are given as gifts and therefore  sell in larger volumes during the christmas shopping season 
because of the company s continued dependency on its major customers  the timing of purchases by these major customers and the timing of new product introductions causes quarterly fluctuations in the company s net sales 
the company believes that in the first quarter of net sales were negatively impacted by certain major customers lowering their retail inventory levels 
the company believes the first quarter of net sales will be positively impacted as retail customers restock inventory levels reduced by a strong fourth quarter of sell through 
the strong sell through continues in the first quarter of as a consequence  results in prior quarters are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
other the company believes that the domestic vacuum cleaner industry is a mature industry with modest annual growth in many of its products but with a decline in certain other products 
competition is dependent upon price  quality  extension of product lines  and advertising and promotion expenditures 
additionally  competition is influenced by innovation in the design of replacement models and by marketing and approaches to distribution

year compliance many currently installed computer systems are not capable of distinguishing the year from the year as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies in a wide variety of applications will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the scope and magnitude of problems associated with the century change 
the company has developed a year action plan to address this concern 
a project team has performed a detailed assessment of all internal computer systems and is developing and implementing plans to either convert or replace the software or equipment that is not year compliant 
the company expects to complete these projects during year problems could affect many of the company s production  distribution  financial  administrative and communication operations  as well as the processing of customer orders 
the company s internal business system was modified to be year compliant in the third quarter of testing and verification of the system will be performed throughout the company has completed its inventory of embedded systems and is currently in the assessment phase for this critical area 
in addition  the company has asked vendors  service suppliers  communications providers and banks to verify their year readiness  their system failures could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
action is being taken based on individual responses 
external and internal costs directly associated with modifying internal use software for year compliance are expensed as incurred 
as of december   the costs incurred for this project were primarily year compliance continued attributable to internal personnel costs and consulting fees which were estimated at the remaining costs to fix the year problems are estimated at approximately  which will be incurred in these costs do not include normal system replacements and upgrades 
the company does not expect year compliance costs to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is uncertain of the above expectations 
for example  if the company is unsuccessful in identifying or fixing all year problems in the company s critical operations or if the company is affected by the inability of suppliers or major customers such as one of our top customers to continue operations due to such a problem  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows could be materially impacted 
the total costs that the company incurs in connection with the year problems will be influenced by the company s ability to successfully identify year systems flaws  the nature and amount of programming required to fix the affected programs  the related labor and or consulting costs for such remediation and the ability of third parties with whom we have business relationships to successfully address their own year concerns 
these and other unforeseen factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
based on available information  the company does not believe any material exposure to significant business interruption exists as a result of year compliance issues 
the company has begun the process to develop formal contingency plans that will address mission critical activities as determined by management in the event the year project is not completed in a timely manner 
these contingency plans will be completed in the first half of forward looking statements forward looking statements in this form k are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements which speak only as of the date hereof 
potential risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general business and economic conditions  the financial strength of the retail industry particularly the major mass retail channel  the competitive pricing environment within the vacuum cleaner segment of the floor care industry  the cost and effectiveness of planned advertising  marketing and promotional campaigns  the success at retail and the acceptance by consumers of the company s new products  including the company s line of dirt devil r vision uprights with bagless technology  the dependence upon the company s ability to continue to successfully develop and introduce innovative products and unforeseen technological issues associated with the year compliance efforts
