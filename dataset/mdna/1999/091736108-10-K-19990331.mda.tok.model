impact of year issue year readiness disclosure made pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act  pub 
l 
no 
the year presents potential concerns and issues for the company as well as other companies in the software industry 
in general  year readiness issues typically arise in computer software and hardware systems that use two digit date formats  instead of four digit dates  to represent a particular year 
users must test their unique combination of hardware  system software including databases  transaction processors  and operating systems and application software in order to achieve year readiness 
this issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its own computer and embedded systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on financial and other transactions worldwide 
failure of the company s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
year committee the company has established a year steering committee to evaluate  plan and implement policies and practices  including contingency planning  and to address the impact of the year on the company and its products 
the company s year readiness preparations fall into three categories product readiness  addressing product functionality  internal readiness  addressing the year operability of internal information technology it systems and mission critical non it systems  and third party readiness  addressing the preparedness of relevant third parties and the year operability of products furnished for internal use and resale 
after reviewing these areas  the committee will report to the board of directors specific areas of concern and a plan for resolving and further testing of any remaining year issues 
the committee will also formulate a contingency plan in the event that the committee reasonably determines that certain year issues may not be resolved by the end of or if unforeseen problems arise 
status of investigation product readiness the company has established year date operability standards against which the most current versions of its software products are being tested 
during  the company initiated a program to update its accounting and information systems  where applicable  to ensure that its computer systems are year compliant 
bitstream currently expects to be substantially complete analyzing its current internal systems  as well as developing contingency plans for certain internal systems  by mid in addition  the company maintains a year expert on its staff to continue to assess  plan and implement solutions that will prepare its internal systems for january  bitstream believes that these solutions will not pose significant operational problems for the company  and that the costs of such preparations will not be material 
however  if contingency plans were to fail or new non compliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company has completed testing of its current software products and believes the most current versions conform to these standards and are year ready 
despite the company s testing  there can be no assurance that the company s products do not contain undetected errors or defects related to year operability that may result in material costs to the company or that the company s products contain all features and functionality considered necessary by customers  end users and distributors to be year ready 
while the company believes that most of its current releases of products are year ready  other factors may result in an application created using the company s products not being year ready 
some of these factors include improper programming techniques used by third parties in creating the application  customization  or non compliance of hardware  software or firmware not provided by the company with which the products operate 
the company does not believe that it would be liable in such an event 
however  due to the unprecedented nature of the potential litigation related to year readiness as discussed in the industry and popular press  the most likely worst case scenario is that the company would be subject to litigation 
it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by such litigation 
the company has tested only the current versions of its products  and does not plan to test earlier versions of products 
the company believes a substantial number of the company s customers are running product versions which have not been tested and may experience year date related operability issues 
the company is in the process of identifying these customers and encouraging them to upgrade to current versions of the products 
further  the company cautions users of such products to conduct their own year operability testing to determine if continued use of the products allows them to meet their own year readiness objectives 
while many customers will be upgraded to year ready versions of products under maintenance coverage  if eligible  in the normal course the company expects to incur some increased expenses associated with the furnishing of upgrades and modifications 
in addition  the ability of the company to implement upgrades in time to meet customer s year readiness requirements requires the continued availability of qualified technical personnel and the company may incur additional costs to attract and retain such personnel as the year draws closer 
at this time the company does not believe that the cost of potential upgrades or modifications will have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
status of investigation internal readiness the company is engaged in conducting a year readiness audit of its internal it and non it systems including telecommunication  facilities management  safety and security systems 
although the company is not presently aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal it and non it systems for the year  the company is continuing its investigation and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience unanticipated negative consequences or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems  which include third party hardware  firmware  and software 
the company anticipates finalizing its testing of internal it and non it systems on or about september  status of investigation third party readiness the company is continuing to assess the year readiness of material third parties  such as public utilities and key clients or suppliers  who provide external services to the company 
the company expects to substantially complete these assessments and testing by the middle of the company has certain key relationships with suppliers which furnish components and software used by the company in its products 
if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they supply to the company  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  reputation  and financial results 
certain of the company s products contain third party components and software that are integral to their operation for which the cost and time to integrate alternative components or software into these products would be material 
contingency plans and worst case scenario at the present time  the company is in the process of outlining contingency plans to operate in the event that its products  systems  or business partners are not year ready 
if the company s investigations suggest that there is a significant risk that certain products  systems  or business partners might not be year ready  the company will modify its contingency plans accordingly 
costs  source of funds and accounting treatment the company s policy is to expense all costs related to its year compliance program unless the useful life of the technological asset is extended or increased 
the expenses incurred to date have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
at this time  the company intends to fund year expenses through cash flows from operations
