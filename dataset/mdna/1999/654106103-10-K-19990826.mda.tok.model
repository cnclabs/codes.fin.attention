item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations highlights 
in fiscal year  net income increased to million  or per diluted share 
net income included a net pre tax restructuring charge of million  million after taxes  or per diluted share 

excluding fiscal years and restructuring charges  fiscal net income remained constant with the prior year 

fiscal year revenues declined for the first time in five years  dropping to billion 

gross margins as percentage of revenues improved to  compared to in the prior year 

selling and administrative expenses dropped by nearly million or  and were of revenues compared with in the prior year 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal despite an overall revenue decline  net income increased over the prior year 
an improved gross margin percentage  reduced selling and administrative expenses  along with a lower net restructuring charge in fiscal compared to the prior year  primarily drove this increase 
excluding both the and restructuring charges  our net income was relatively flat year on year 
continued cost control activities and the effect of improved inventory levels on our margins were key factors that offset the effects of reduced revenues 
revenues decreased for the first time in five years 
in the united states  revenues declined by  asia pacific s revenues reduced by over a third compared to last year  while europe revenues increased 
we put a considerable amount of effort into improving product buying patterns and  as a result  the composition and levels of inventory resulted in improved gross margins relative to a year ago 
the activities associated with the fiscal restructuring charge helped to reduce selling and administrative expenses in fiscal by nearly million 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure in light of existing and planned revenue levels 
in fiscal  we took specific action to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs 
some of these actions resulted in a restructuring charge in fiscal year see below and note for a more complete analysis of this charge 
total nike brand revenues decreased compared to fiscal had this decrease been measured in dollars constant with that of the prior year  the net decrease would not have been materially different 
the us  which represents our largest market segment  experienced the largest dollar reduction  decreasing million  or 
sales of us footwear decreased  representing a decrease in pairs sold of and a decrease in average selling price of 
the reduction in sales was primarily attributable to the continued soft retail environment as retailers adjusted their buying patterns to avoid inventory build ups 
revenues from nearly all customer accounts and distribution channels were down 
however  certain product categories improved over the prior year 
running  which is the largest us footwear category  increased  and brand jordan improved by 
basketball and training which together with running and brand jordan comprise over of the total us footwear business decreased and  respectively 
apparel revenues in the us decreased 
three of the top five apparel categories experienced revenue decreases  including branded athletic down  accessories down  and special make up product down 
tee shirt revenues increased  while kids remained flat with last year 
non us nike brand revenues decreased million  or  an decrease had the dollar remained constant with that of the prior year 
sales outside the usa now represent of total nike brand revenues 
revenues in europe increased in constant dollars  driven by a increase in apparel 
apparel sales in europe surpassed the billion mark for the first time 
during the last four years  europe has experienced a compounded annual revenue growth rate 
asia pacific declined in total revenues in constant dollars  due to the continued weak market conditions in that region 
however  as discussed further below  increasing futures orders in that region  compared with the previous year  would indicate an improvement in this trend 
the americas region  including the start up operations of the africa region  decreased  in constant dollars 
the countries outside the us that represent the largest percentage of our total international businesses are the united kingdom  which increased in real and constant dollars  japan  which decreased in real and constant dollars  france  which increased in constant dollars  italy  which increased in constant dollars  spain  which increased in constant dollars  canada  which decreased  in constant dollars  and germany  which increased in constant dollars 
the decrease in other brands is predominately due to reduced sales of in line skating and roller hockey categories at bauer nike hockey 
other brands include cole haan  bauer nike hockey inc formerly bauer inc  sports specialties corp 
nike team sports inc effective june   and nike ihm  inc formerly tetra plastics  inc we currently expect that revenues in fiscal year will be up slightly compared to fiscal futures orders see further discussion below is one indication of revenue trends over the next two quarters 
footwear futures orders are trending up in every region  and are positive in every region except the americas 
apparel futures orders are mixed 
in the us  apparel futures have trended down for seven straight quarters 
in europe apparel futures orders are strong  and they are significantly improved in asia pacific 
the breakdown of revenues follows may  chg chg in millions usa region footwear    apparel    equipment and other total usa    europe region footwear    apparel  equipment and other total europe    asia pacific region footwear apparel equipment and other total asia pacific   americas region footwear apparel equipment and other total americas total nike brand    other brands total revenues    gross margins increased to of revenues in fiscal  up basis points from the previous year 
the increase over the prior year can be attributed to reduced levels of closeout product sales 
in addition  we are selling a much greater percentage of our closeout product through our own factory outlets  which has resulted in improved gross margins on close out sales and lower reserves against our overall inventory 
while sales of in line product decreased  our closeout sales decreased by 
as a result  despite the decline in our in line business in fiscal  in line sales increased to of our overall business  an increase of basis points over the prior year 
reducing our inventory levels was a key initiative for nike in fiscal year our finished goods inventory decreased in all regions  most notably in asia pacific  which decreased  europe  which decreased  and the us  which decreased 
aggressive selling of us apparel closeout inventories  and the effects of the foreign exchange rates on non us sales  predominately in europe  negatively affected gross margins 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues should improve slightly in fiscal  primarily due to a much improved inventory position going into the year compared with the same period last year 
selling and administrative expenses decreased nearly million compared to fiscal year  and totaled of revenues  up slightly from in the prior year 
key drivers of this reduction were the actions taken in fiscal year to reduce our overall cost structure  which resulted in a restructuring charge in quarter four of fiscal year although total nike brand salaries and wages increased over the prior year  wholesale business salaries and wages decreased  driven by the headcount reductions which occurred as part of the restructuring activities 
offsetting this were increases in salaries and wages of retail operations  given the addition of nike factory stores and niketowns over the last two years 
other significant reductions to selling and administrative expenses were advertising costs  which were down  and sports marketing expenses  which were down 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative costs in fiscal should be consistent with that of fiscal although we have taken action to further align our costs with expected revenue levels see fiscal restructuring charge below  expenses in fiscal year will be affected by investments in a new company wide system development project  planned start up activities around new nike retail stores  increased spending for demand creation  and the transition into expanded headquarters in oregon 
the reduction in interest expense of million or compared to last year is due primarily to lower levels of short term borrowings given decreased working capital throughout the year 
see further discussion under liquidity and capital resources below 
other income expense was a net expense of million in fiscal included in this amount is a credit of million related to the change in accounting for substantially all inventories in the us from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
the change was effected in the fourth quarter of fiscal and was not considered significant to show the cumulative effect or to restate comparable income statements as dictated by accounting principles board opinion no 
this change was predicated on the fact that the lifo method no longer matches the realities of how we do business 
exclusive of this credit  other income expense was a net expense of million  an increase over the prior year of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the losses incurred on the disposal of assets of million  most significantly related to production and planning software development costs that were abandoned 
the majority of the remainder of other income expense is comprised of interest income  profit sharing expense  foreign exchange conversion gains and losses  and the amortization of goodwill  which remained relatively consistent with prior year amounts 
worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november totaled billion  higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of fiscal the orders and percentage growth in these orders is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth in subsequent periods 
this is because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues 
fiscal compared to fiscal decreasing revenue growth  a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses  as well as a fourth quarter restructuring charge  all contributed to fiscal s decrease in net income compared to the prior year 
the asian economic crisis and declining revenues in the united states were the primary reasons for the lower earnings 
consumer spending declined considerably in asia during fiscal as a result of macroeconomic issues facing that region 
as a result  revenue growth in the asia pacific region fell well short of our expectations  resulting in excess inventory levels and increased levels of discounted product sales  both having a negative impact on that region s gross margin percentage 
additionally  spending did not adjust as quickly as the sudden decline in revenue growth  resulting in significantly higher selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues in that region 
revenues increased over fiscal  and would have increased had the dollar remained constant with that of the prior year 
despite the economic issues facing the asian markets  total non us revenues increased  on a constant dollar basis  and represented of total nike revenues 
revenue increases were experienced in every region except the us the countries outside the us that represented the largest percent of our total international business were japan  which increased in constant dollars  the united kingdom  which increased in constant dollars  canada which increased in constant dollars  france  which increased in constant dollars  italy  which increased in both real and constant dollars  and spain  which increased in constant dollars 
notable countries that experienced revenue reductions were korea which decreased in constant dollars and germany  which decreased but increased in constant dollars 
us revenues decreased compared to the prior year 
us footwear and apparel revenues decreased compared to the prior year 
us footwear  representing nike s largest market segment  decreased over million in sales  or  representing a decrease in pairs sold of  and a decrease of in average selling price 
the reduction in sales was primarily attributable to the glut of inventory at retail  which reduced customer order volumes and increased order cancellation rates 
the decrease in average selling price was due to increased mix of lower priced product  given the higher volume of close out sales 
us apparel increased million  or  over the prior year 
nearly all categories experienced revenue increases  the largest individual categories being training up  accessories up  kids up  tee shirts up and golf up 
gross margins declined to of revenues in fiscal  down basis points from the previous year 
significant to this decline were the increased levels of close out sales at greatly reduced selling prices  and increased levels of inventory reserves against higher close out inventory levels  particularly in the us and asia 
the combination of these two factors reduced annual margins by more than basis points 
other reasons for the reduced gross margin percentage were the strengthening of the us dollar  which can inhibit our ability to price products competitively in international markets  fixed costs associated with distribution facilities  increasing royalty costs associated with athlete endorsement contracts  and increased levels of research and development costs 
selling and administrative expenses increased million over the prior year  representing of revenues compared to in the prior year 
the most significant increases were in the wage base  which was up overall  led principally by the us and asia pacific  endorsement contract related costs  which were up primarily as a result of significant new contracts in soccer and golf categories  along with enhanced arrangements with the nfl  wnba  and nba  and rent and depreciation  which were up and  respectively  relating principally to expanded retail outlets and niketown stores  along with capital projects in the distribution and computer infrastructure areas 
interest expense increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the increase was due to the addition of long term debt of approximately million in june  to fund capital projects  offset by lower levels of short term borrowings 
other income expense was a net expense of million in fiscal year  compared with million in the majority of the decrease is attributable to an million restructuring charge incurred in with corresponding amounts in included in the restructuring charge 
other amounts include profit share expense  which decreased due to lower earnings  interest income  which decreased compared with the prior year given the lower average levels of cash on hand throughout the year  and foreign exchange conversion gains and losses 
as further explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  prior to fiscal year  certain of our non us operations reported their results of operations on a one month lag which allowed more time to compile results 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  the one month lag was eliminated and the may charge from operations for these entities of million was recorded to retained earnings 
this change did not have a material effect on the annual results of operations 
fiscal restructuring charge during fiscal  a million restructuring charge was incurred as a result of certain actions taken to better align our cost structure with expected revenue growth rates 
as a result of the plans detailed below  we expect to remove approximately million from our cost structure in future years 
some of the savings will not be experienced for one to two years as personnel transitions are scheduled to occur over time 
the charge shown below in tabular format was primarily for costs of severing employees  including severance packages  lease abandonments and the write down of assets no longer in use 
two major areas that were affected by the reduction in force include our information technology functions  primarily in the us  as we shifted to an outsource agreement for certain areas  and european customer service and accounting  where we are in the process of consolidating functions from individual countries to our european headquarters 
outside of these two areas  employees were terminated from various other areas around the company  including our asia pacific region 
the total number of employees terminated was  with having left nike as of may  the second major component of the charge was a write off of certain equipment  hardware and software development costs at one of our us distribution centers due to a change in strategy around how we flow product for a specific type of business 
there are no significant costs that have not been recognized with relation to the above plans

as a result of the specific plans described below  we were able to remove approximately million from our cost structure in fiscal and beyond 
these savings were predominately due to reduced wage related costs  reduced carrying cost of property  plant and equipment  reduced rent charges associated with office and expatriate housing and other miscellaneous savings 
during fiscal  it was determined that a total of million of the restructuring accrual was not required due to changes in estimates related to severance payments of million  a million change in estimated vendor software costs related to japan s software development  lease commitments of million due to changes in sub leasing arrangements  and other changes of million 
the million is included as an offset in the restructuring charge on the income statement 
the restructuring activities shown below in tabular format primarily related to the following the elimination of job responsibilities company wide 
employees were terminated from all regions and almost all areas of nike  including marketing  sales and administrative areas 
related charges include severance packages  both cash payments made directly to terminated employees as well as outplacement services  lease cancellations and commitments  for both excess office space and expatriate employee housing  and write down of assets no longer in use 
such assets  which include office equipment and expatriate employee housing and furniture have been sold or abandoned as of may  a total of  employees were terminated as part of the plan  of which  have been paid and have left nike as of may  the remaining five will receive their severance packages and leave during the first quarter of fiscal year downsizing of the asia pacific headquarters in hong kong 
we made the decision to reduce the size of the asia pacific headquarters operations and to relocate the regional headquarter responsibilities to our worldwide headquarters in the us included in the restructuring charge are costs associated with the termination of employees  lease cancellations and commitments and the write down of assets no longer in use 
such assets have been sold or abandoned as of may  a total of employees were terminated as part of the plan 
all of them have left and been paid their severance as of may  downsizing of the japan distribution center 
we are in the process of constructing a new distribution center in japan 
due to the economic downturn in the asia pacific region and the impact on our business in japan  the forecasted volume of inventories and product flow decreased significantly from the original plans 
because of this  we redesigned the distribution center to efficiently accommodate new forecasted volumes of inventories and product flow 
the remaining amount of the accrual is a payment due to the software vendor involved and payment is expected to be made during the first quarter of fiscal year cancellation of endorsement contracts 
as a result of the downturn in our business  we have refocused our marketing along core product categories 
we went through a process of reviewing all endorsement contracts in non core product categories and the charge included the final settlements for those contracts where termination agreements with endorsees were reached  releasing the endorsees from all contractual obligations 
the final outstanding payment is expected to be made in the first quarter of fiscal year exiting certain manufacturing operations at bauer nike hockey subsidiary 
the charge related to the decision to exit certain manufacturing operations at bauer nike hockey and consisted of machinery and equipment that has been sold or abandoned as of may   as well as the disposal of two operating plants 
the two operating plants have been disposed of as of may  as a result of the reduced level of manufacturing operations  employees were terminated  all of which have left as of may   however some severance payments have yet to be made and are expected to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal year fy reserve restructuring balance description cash non cash charge activity at in millions elimination of job responsibilities company wide severance packages cash lease cancellations commitments cash write down of assets non cash other cash downsizing the asia pacific headquarters in hong kong severance packages cash lease cancellations commitments cash write down of assets non cash downsizing the japan distribution center write off of assets non cash software development costs

during the transition period ending december   public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency 
beginning january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  with the legacy currencies being completely withdrawn from circulation on june  we have had a dedicated project team working on euro strategy since january we are in the process of making modifications to information technology systems including marketing  order management  purchasing  invoicing  payroll  and cash management 
many of our systems are already euro compliant 
our plan is to have most systems converted to euro compliance by the end of calendar year  well ahead of the end of the transitional period 
we believe the introduction of the euro may create a move towards a greater level of price harmonization although differing country costs and value added tax rates will continue to result in price differences at a retail level 
we have a process in place to analyze price trends among countries 
currency exchange and hedging costs will typically be reduced  due to the introduction of the euro 
the costs of implementing the euro are generally related to modification of existing systems  and are estimated to be approximately million 
these costs will be expensed as incurred 
nike believes that the conversion to the euro will not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
year the year issue the year or yk issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such software may recognize a date using as the year or some other year  rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in nike s activities and operations 
if we  our significant suppliers or customers fail to make necessary modifications  conversions and contingency plans on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
state of readiness project categories 
in may  nike established a corporate wide project team to oversee  monitor and coordinate the company wide year effort 
our year project focuses on three areas information technology it systems  such as application software  mainframes  pcs  networks and production control systems  non it systems  such as equipment  machinery  climate control and security systems  which may contain microcontrollers with embedded technology  and suppliers and customers 
nike uses a four phase approach to fix or replace non compliant it systems inventory  assessment of risks and impact and prioritization of projects tier critical vital to business operations tier high priority important to business operations tier moderate priority minor disruption to operations expected if non compliant tier low priority will not disrupt operations even if non compliant  remediation fix  replace or develop contingency plans for non compliant systems  testing validation and implementation  and completion and auditing results where appropriate 
when appropriate  we have engaged the services of independent consultants to analyze and develop testing standards  quality assurance and contingency plans 
we use our internal auditing department to review year compliance and have consulted with external independent consultants to evaluate and review those results 
it projects 
by early  we had identified major internal it remediation projects worldwide 
we have completed our assessment and prioritization of all of our it projects 
of the projects  we have completed and tested as year compliant as of may  of the remaining projects  we have classified four as tier  as tier  and eight as tier we expect that all tier projects will be completed as year compliant by july   all tier by august   and all tier by october  nike plans to continue integrated testing through the end of the year 
in addition  we will halt or freeze new installations and upgrades of all operational systems beginning on october  and continuing through january or until we determine the risk for system failure has passed 
non it projects 
by early  we had identified major internal non it remediation projects worldwide 
we have completed our assessment and prioritization of all of our major non it systems 
we have designated all of these projects as high priority 
these include facilities that are critical to nike s business operations  potentially including equipment  machinery  climate control and security systems at regional headquarters  key distribution centers  and in countries with significant sales 
we are currently remediating these priority non it projects and expect to complete them all as year compliant by august  all other non it projects are classified as non priority non it projects  which include climate control  security and mechanical systems in all other facilities 
to the extent that these non priority  non it projects may not be completed by december   we do not expect that any non compliance or failure of these systems  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on nike s manufacturing  distribution  inventory control or the management and collection of our accounts receivable 
for this reason  we have not set a completion date for remediation of the remaining non priority non it systems 
suppliers and customers 
we have focused our year compliance efforts on our significant suppliers and customers those that are material to our business and are assessing the year readiness of these significant suppliers and customers 
we have assessed the year readiness of of our suppliers  of which we consider to be significant suppliers 
we have also assessed the year readiness of customers  of which we consider to be significant customers 
we have relationships with significant suppliers and customers in most of the locations in which we operate 
the level of preparedness of our significant suppliers and customers varies greatly from operation to operation and country to country 
nike relies on suppliers to timely deliver a broad range of goods and services worldwide  including raw materials  footwear  apparel  accessories  equipment  advertising  transportation services  banking services  telecommunications and utilities 
moreover  our suppliers rely on countless other suppliers  over which we may have little or no influence regarding year compliance 
we have sent surveys to all of our significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which we may be affected by those third parties yk preparedness plans 
a substantial majority of our significant suppliers and customers have not responded to our surveys  have not provided assurance of their year readiness  or have not responded with sufficient detail for us to determine their year readiness 
in the absence of adequate responses  we are making independent assessments of our significant suppliers and customers and the countries in which they operate 
these assessments include direct contact and discussions with persons coordinating yk compliance efforts for our significant suppliers and customers 
we also research regulatory filings and other public information available to nike provided by our significant suppliers and customers and  in general  countries in which they operate 
we have identified as higher risk many of the countries that have been widely identified by government agencies and public reports as being significantly behind in their yk status 
contingency plans 
having completed our identification and assessment of major projects  our worst case scenario would be a failure of multiple significant suppliers to supply merchandise or services for a prolonged period of time that would materially impair our ability to ship product in a timely and reliable manner to our customers 
although the occurrence of this scenario could have a material adverse effect on nike  we do not have a basis to determine at this time whether such a scenario is reasonably likely to occur 
we believe that suppliers and customers present the area of greatest risk to disruption of our operations because of our limited ability to influence actions of third parties or to estimate the level and impact of their noncompliance throughout the extended supply chain 
we are currently developing contingency plans for our significant suppliers and customers  which we expect to finalize by september  in addition  we are developing contingency plans that assume some estimated level of non compliance by  or business disruption to  certain other suppliers and customers on a case by case basis 
we will continue to develop on an as needed basis throughout we are also developing contingency plans for our tier it systems  which we expect to finalize by august  the contingency plans for our suppliers and customers include  where appropriate  booking orders and manufacturing and shipping products before anticipated business disruptions  shifting production capacity from facilities that nike determines to be at high risk of noncompliance or business disruption  consolidating finance vendors  and temporarily discontinuing business with suppliers determined to be high risk of noncompliance or business disruption and finding alternative suppliers 
the contingency plans for our tier it systems include  where appropriate  manual work processes  storing additional sets of backup data before critical process dates  off site system recovery  and temporarily shifting production software from one hardware system to another 
in addition  personnel we deem essential to system operation and recovery are scheduled to be available during high risk periods 
we continually update our assessments and revise our contingency plans for our significant suppliers and customers as we receive additional information from them concerning their yk preparedness 
however  judgments regarding contingency plans such as how to develop them and to what extent are subject to many variables and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that nike will correctly anticipate the level  impact or duration of noncompliance by its suppliers and customers 
as a result  there is no certainty that our contingency plans will be sufficient to mitigate the impact of noncompliance by suppliers and customers and some material adverse effect to nike may result from one or more third parties regardless of our contingency plans 
the failure of any contingency plans could have a material adverse effect on nike s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
cost 
costs associated with our efforts around year issues are expensed as incurred  unless they relate to the purchase of hardware and software  and software development  in which case they are capitalized 
as of may   nike estimates that total costs related to the year issue will be approximately to million  of which approximately million have been incurred 
of the million  approximately million are external expenses  million internal costs and million replacement projects 
approximately million of the non replacement expenses will be capitalized  the remainder has been expensed as incurred 
nike funds year costs through operating cash flows 
we presently believe that the total cost of achieving year compliant systems will not be material to our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
estimates of time  cost and risk estimates are based on currently available information 
developments that could affect estimates include  but are not limited to the availability and cost of trained personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code and systems  cooperation and year readiness of our suppliers and customers and their suppliers and customers  and the ability to correctly anticipate risks and implement suitable contingency plans in the event of system failures at nike or with our suppliers and customers and their suppliers and customers 
the above section  even if incorporated by reference into other documents or disclosures  is a year readiness disclosure as defined under the year information and readiness disclosure act of recenty issued accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
in may  the financial accounting standards board delayed the required implementation date by one year  making it effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  june  for nike 
this statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
management has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of fas will have on nike s results from operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources nike s financial position remains strong at may  shareholders equity increased million and remained at billion 
compared to may  total assets decreased  or million 
working capital decreased million to remain at billion  and nike s current ratio was at may  compared to at may  cash provided by operations reached nearly billion  an increase of million over the prior year  primarily due to increased net income and a significant reduction in working capital 
inventories decreased million  or  as we focused on reducing the levels of excess and slow moving inventory relative to a year ago 
accounts receivable decreased million  or  primarily due to lower revenue levels as well as a slight improvement in our receivable collection days 
additions to property  plant and equipment for fiscal year were million compared to million for fiscal year the largest single project was the expansion of our world headquarters 
other expenditures in the us were for warehouse expansions  retail store additions and ongoing investments in systems infrastructure 
approximately million of the total additions occurred outside of the us and were due mostly to warehouse and retail expansions 
we expect fiscal year capital expenditures to be approximately million more than fiscal year levels  primarily due to the fact that we have  subsequent to the date of the financial statements  consummated a purchase of a distribution facility in japan 
until recently we had intended to lease the facility 
as part of the purchase  certain long term debt obligations were assumed in the amount of approximately million 
the remainder of the purchase was financed by short term borrowings 
long term debt levels have remained consistent with that of prior year 
in fiscal year  we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission sec for the sale of up to million of debt securities 
under this program  we have issued million of medium term notes  million in fiscal  maturing december   and million in fiscal year  maturing in three to five years 
the proceeds were swapped into dutch guilders to obtain medium term fixed rate financing to support the growth of our european operations 
in february of  we filed a shelf registration with the sec for again  the sale of up to million in debt securities  of which million had been previously registered but not issued under the fiscal year registration discussed above 
in addition  during fiscal year we have used cash to reduce notes payable  fund property  plant and equipment additions  repurchase stock  and pay dividends 
management believes that significant funds generated by operations  together with access to sufficient sources of funds  will adequately meet our anticipated operating  global infrastructure expansion  and capital needs 
significant short and long term lines of credit are maintained with banks which  along with cash on hand  provide adequate operating liquidity 
our commercial paper program  under which there was million and million outstanding at may  and  respectively  also provides liquidity 
dividends per share of common stock for fiscal rose 
over fiscal to 
per share 
dividend declaration in all four quarters has been consistent since february based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements  we anticipate continuing a dividend and reviewing its amount at the november board of directors meeting 
our policy continues to target an annual dividend in the range of to of trailing twelve month earnings 
in the fourth quarter  nike purchased a total of million shares of our class b common stock for approximately million under the billion four year program approved in december during all of fiscal  we purchased million shares for a total of million 
funding has  and is expected to continue to  come from operating cash flow in conjunction with short term borrowings 
the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by working capital needs and stock market conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes due to our international sales  production  and funding requirements 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates using a variety of financial instruments 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
foreign currency and interest rate transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives and we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
in addition to product sales and costs  we have foreign currency risk related to debt that is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from sales  purchases and other costs from the adverse impact of exchange rate movements 
foreign exchange risk is managed by using forward exchange contracts and purchased options to hedge certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
purchased currency options are used to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions expected to be recognized within one year 
by policy  we maintain hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages 
cross currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in european currencies  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and international expansion 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives we maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of aggregate debt and finance working capital needs through our payables agreement with nissho iwai american corporation  various bank loans  and commercial paper 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk and related derivatives use using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
we determined these interrelationships by observing foreign currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding days 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
the model includes all of our forwards  options  cross currency swaps and yen denominated debt ie  our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments and accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates
