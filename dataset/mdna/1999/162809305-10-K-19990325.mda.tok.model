comparable store sales for the company were above the prior year representing the first full year increase in six years 
the first quarter of the year featured the successful introduction of a spicy chicken sandwich that was somewhat unique to the quick service segment 
other product innovations during the year included the transition to a two patty platform that enabled the company to utilize a large hamburger patty for a premium sandwich while also using a smaller hamburger patty for its lower priced menu offerings 
critical to the success of these and other menu offerings was the operational and marketing focus on serving fresh food
