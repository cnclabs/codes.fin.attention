item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations earnings summary the company reported net income of  or basic and diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended september  this compares to net income of  basic and diluted net income per share in fiscal and  basic and diluted net income per share in fiscal results decreased in comparison to due to the increase in flexible circuit sales to the disk drive industry not offsetting the phase out of lead wire assembly revenue 
this was due in part to continued disk drive industry softness 
this softness appears to be the result of an over supply of disk drives and due to a reduction in the number of disk drives kept in inventory by computer manufacturers that have adopted a build to order business model 
also contributing to the sales decrease was a reduction in the average number of heads per disk drive 
this reduction is the result of an increasing number of low cost disk drives being sold and as a result of the use of magneto resistive mr and giant magneto resistive gmr disk drive heads which increase the storage capacity per disk drive platter and reduce the number of heads required to provide the same disk drive capacity 
the decrease in fiscal results as compared to was also due to softness in the cyclical disk drive industry 
the drop in gross margin percent during was due to several factors  the inclusion of weeks of lower margin adflex related sales  reduced yields and costs related to an aggressive new product ramp up in production concurrent with new flexible circuit capacity installation and due to lower shipments of lead wire assemblies reducing the leverage of the fixed overhead costs related to their production 
the drop in gross margin percent during as compared to resulted principally from lower shipments of disk drive lead wire assemblies and the start up costs of the new litchfield facility 
operating expenses were of revenue in fiscal as compared to and of revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales for is primarily due to increases in marketing  professional and legal expenses 
the percentage increase in from was due to decreased revenues as actual operating expenses dropped by results of operations net sales 
net sales for fiscal were  a increase from net sales of  the increase in was primarily due to the fourth quarter results including eight weeks of operating results related to the acquisition of adflex solutions  inc excluding the acquisition related revenue  net sales would have decreased by 
fiscal revenue continued to be impacted by the transition of the disk drive industry from traditional lead wire interconnects to integrated interconnects including the company s head interconnect flex hif 
the large increase in these flexible circuit sales to the disk drive industry did not offset the phase out of lead wire assembly revenue 
this was due in part to continued disk drive industry softness 
this softness appears to be the result of an over supply of disk drives and due to a reduction in the number of disk drives kept in inventory by computer manufacturers that have adopted a build to order business model 
also contributing to the sales decrease was a reduction in the average number of heads per disk drive 
this reduction is the result of an increasing number of low cost disk drives being sold and as a result of the use of magneto resistive mr and giant magneto resistive gmr disk drive heads which increase the storage capacity per disk drive platter and reduce the number of heads required to provide the same disk drive capacity 
net sales for fiscal decreased from net sales of  the decrease in sales was related to softness in the disk drive industry 
the softness was primarily the result of an oversupply of disk drives caused by excess disk drive production in and the reduction of inventory levels by computer manufacturers as they adopted a build to order business model 
another contributing factor was a reduction in the average number of heads per disk drive 
this reduction is the result of the conversion to mr heads which increased the storage capacity per disk drive platter and reduced the number of heads required to provide the same disk drive capacity 
the higher prices obtained from the sale of mr assemblies which have a higher value added content and sell for a higher price than the low end inductive assemblies  have partially offset the decreased number of assemblies being sold 
the fourth quarter was also impacted by the disk drive industry s transition away from lead wire assembly interconnects and into alternative interconnect technologies 
flexible circuit sales continue to increase as a proportion of total sales providing of fiscal sales as compared to for fiscal the company exited fiscal with flexible circuits comprising over of the company s net sales 
this increase has been primarily due to shipments from the company s high volume  flexible circuit production facility placed into service in fiscal the facility is currently being utilized to produce the hif  fsa and bfc products for the disk drive industry and other high technology flexible circuits 
fiscal should benefit from continued growth in the demand for high technology flexible circuits including the company s hif  fsa and bridge flex 
reductions in lead wire assembly revenue should not have a significant impact on fiscal revenue as the transition away from lead wire assembly interconnects to integrated interconnects was nearly complete at the end of fiscal significant progress was made during fiscal in gaining customer acceptance of the company s fsa product which will be integral to increasing revenue in the last half of fiscal revenue is expected to increase significantly in fiscal as a result of the adflex acquisition 
the acquisition of adflex should also reduce the company s dependence on the disk drive industry to of total revenue 
sales from iconovex made up less than of the company s total revenue in fiscal export sales accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal as compared to for and for  reflecting the high level of interconnect shipments to disk drive manufacturers in asia 
a significant portion of the remaining domestic sales are subsequently shipped internationally by the company s customers 
gross margin 
the company s gross profit margin decreased to of sales in fiscal as compared to in the decrease in was partially due to the fourth quarter results including eight weeks of operating results related to the acquisition of adflex solutions  inc the adflex revenue generates a lower gross margin percent than the existing innovex flexible circuit revenue due to the higher material content of the assembly portion of the business and lower level of technical tolerances required 
gross margins for the existing flexible circuit revenue were lower in the fourth quarter due to reduced yields and costs related to an aggressive new product ramp up in production concurrent with new capacity installation 
in addition  the fiscal gross margin percent decreased due to lower shipments of lead wire assemblies reducing the leverage of the fixed overhead costs related to their production 
in  the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to as compared to in gross margin percents decreased primarily due to the lower demand for lead wire assemblies which reduced the leverage of the fixed overhead costs related to their production 
also  pricing pressures returned to normal after being unusually low due to the heavy demand for lead wire assemblies during the flexible circuit gross margin percent was impacted by the increased level of fixed costs relating to the ramp up of the new high volume flexible circuit facility 
the increase in fiscal sales volume related to the adflex acquisition should result in an increase in gross margin dollars while causing a decrease in the overall gross margin percent 
the gross margin percent on the pre acquisition innovex revenue should increase in fiscal as a result of improving flexible circuit manufacturing yields and the elimination of the fixed costs related to the lead wire assembly product line 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in as compared to in and in the increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales for the current year is primarily due to the decrease in revenue and an increase in marketing  professional and legal expenses 
increases in marketing expenses were incurred to expand efforts to diversify the company s revenue base and increases in professional services were due to consultants being retained to improve the manufacturing operation efficiency 
the increase in expenses as a percent of sales is primarily due to the decrease in lead wire assembly sales 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased from primarily due to reduced headcount  a change in estimated bad debts and lower bonus accruals 
fiscal operating expenses as a percent of sales are expected to decrease as a percent of sales and increase in total as a result of the adflex acquisition 
engineering expense increased to of net sales in fiscal from in and in engineering spending remained relatively stable in fiscal as compared to the spending was concentrated on fsa development and the development of a process to manufacture material for use in producing double sided  plated through hole flexible circuits 
the increase in was due both to the decrease in lead wire assembly sales and an increased level of spending 
the actual spending in fiscal increased over as a result of new product development costs for both wire and flexible circuit products and costs related to the new high volume  flexible circuit production facility 
increases in fiscal engineering spending are expected to concentrate on technologies related to the material producing capability  fsa capabilities  semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development 
the company will also be increasing high volume production capabilities and further automating the adflex flexible circuit fabrication processes 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges for fiscal included a million charge related to the discontinuation of the lead wire assembly product line and charges of million related to the disposition of iconovex  innovex s software division 
interest income expense 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  and  in and  respectively 
these increases correspond to increases in average cash and short term investments 
interest expense increased to  in  from  in and  in interest is expected to increase substantially in fiscal related to the new million credit facility put in place related to the adflex acquisition 
other income expense 
net other expense for fiscal included a  charge related to the settlement of threatened litigation by a former director of the company 
income before provision for income taxes 
income before provision for income taxes was  for fiscal as compared to  for and  for as a percent of net sales  income before provision for income taxes was for as compared to and for and liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments decreased by  to  at september  net cash provided by operating activities decreased in to  from  in and  in the reduction in cash and short term investments is primarily due to the adflex acquisition 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures include additional equipment to increase the capacity of the automated flexible circuit production facility and a portion of the costs to construct and equip a material manufacturing facility 
the increase in cash and short term investments was primarily due to cash flows from operations 
during fiscal  the company invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures included a portion of the costs to construct and equip an automated flexible circuit production facility 
this facility was constructed to meet the expected demand for high volume applications including the hif  fsa and semiconductor packaging related products 
on september   the company entered into a new credit facility arranged by norwest bank minnesota na which includes na bank na as an additional lender 
the facility was put in place to pay off all outstanding balances existing at the time of the adflex acquisition under the credit agreement among adflex  bankboston na and bank boston na as agent for lenders  as amended  as required by the adflex merger agreement 
the new credit facility consists of a million  five year revolving line of credit and a million  five year term loan with equal principal payments due each quarter commencing on october  and continuing through the september  maturity date 
working capital decreased by  to  at september  the company s current ratio was to at fiscal year end  compared to to at the end of fiscal the decrease is due to the high level of current liabilities acquired with or resulting from the adflex acquisition 
net property  plant and equipment increased by million to  at september  the increase was due to the adflex acquisition and capital expenditures related to increasing the capacity of the automated flexible circuit production facility and a portion of the costs to construct and equip a new material manufacturing facility 
intangible assets increased million to million at september  primarily as a result of the adflex acquisition 
long term debt  net of current maturities  increased by million as a result of the new credit facility entered into as a result of the adflex acquisition 
the ratio of long term debt to stockholders equity was 
at september  compared to 
at the end of fiscal management believes that existing credit facilities  cash and investments and cash generated from operations will provide an adequate source of funds to support projected working capital  capital expenditures and dividends in fiscal year update the company is taking steps to ensure that it is not adversely affected by the year equipment and software failures that may arise in software applications and equipment with embedded logic where two year digits are used to define the applicable year 
our plan of action and current status follows year state of readiness the company s products do not contain embedded logic and  as such  they do not pose any direct year problem 
innovex s internal operations utilize computer hardware  software and some equipment with embedded logic and the company purchases raw materials from external sources 
in order to prepare for the year  innovex formed an active year committee charged with the responsibility of securing year compliance to the fullest possible extent 
the process was split into six major areas  information system hardware  information system software  all other equipment with potential embedded logic  critical vendors  critical customers and critical utilities and service providers 
information system hardware the manufacturers of the company s computer server and network hardware have indicated that the equipment is year compliant 
comprehensive tests were performed which indicate the computer server and network hardware are year compliant 
the company s personal computers have been tested and computers deemed critical were upgraded if they were not compliant 
information system software the vendors for the company s primary manufacturing and financial software systems have indicated that the software is year compliant 
comprehensive tests verifying the compliance of this software were performed 
personal computer operating systems and primary application software were upgraded to vendor specified year compliant versions as personal computer hardware was tested 
equipment with potential embedded logic a list of all company equipment with potential embedded logic was prepared 
the equipment was prioritized as tier i mission critical and tier ii other equipment 
year date remedies have been developed and implemented for all tier i and tier ii equipment which was not compliant based on information received from the equipment manufacturers 
critical vendors a list of significant vendors was compiled 
letters were sent to these vendors to determine the level of their year compliance 
all critical vendors have replied and indicated that they are currently year compliant or will become compliant during progress toward compliance of all other vendors that are not yet compliant will be monitored with alternative vendors being identified if necessary 
critical customers a list of customers considered significant to the company was compiled 
letters were sent to these customers to determine the level of their year compliance 
approximately have responded indicating full year compliance or have targeted their compliance by calendar third quarter many of the company s customers are proceeding with their own year compliance plans as indicated by their request for information from the company as a supplier to them 
progress toward compliance of all customers that have not yet indicated compliance will be monitored 
utilities and service providers a list of utilities and service providers considered critical to the company s ongoing success was compiled 
these companies have indicated that they are year compliant 
most of these companies are in regulated industries with stringent year compliance requirements and no significant problems are anticipated 
costs to address year issues the company does not anticipate that the costs related to becoming year compliant will be material 
total costs incurred for consultants and equipment and software replacements and upgrades to address the year issue are expected to be less than  costs of implementing the new manufacturing and financial software are not considered related to the year issue 
risks of the company s year issues and contingency plans based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier  customer or another party would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations through business interruption or shutdown  financial loss  reputational damage and legal liability to third parties 
forward looking information statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  elsewhere in the annual report  in the company s form k and in future filings by the company with the sec  except for the historical information contained herein and therein  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include the timely availability and acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  interruptions in the company s operations or those of its suppliers or major customers as may be caused by problems arising from the year and the successful integration of the adflex acquisition 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated from the disk drive and telecommunication industries and any changes in the structure  technology or outlook of these industries could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while the company transacts business predominately in us dollars and most of its net sales are collected in us dollars  a portion of its sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect the company s cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  the company enters into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts hedges in the regular course of business to manage its risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of month or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require the company to exchange us dollars for foreign currencies at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
the gains or losses on hedges of transaction exposure are included in income in the period in which the exchange rates change 
the gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company periodically reviews the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short  balanced for those currencies in which the company has significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   there were no open forward exchange contracts 
no assurance can be given that the company s hedging strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
