item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenues 
revenues for the year ended june  decreased to  as compared to  for fiscal due to a decrease in contract revenue 
the components of revenues are sales  which consist of sales of the company s products and royalties on the sale of such products by others  and contract revenues 
sales increased by to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was due to an increase in adagen sales of approximately  resulting from an increase in patients receiving adagen treatment 
net sales of adagen  which is marketed by enzon  for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
the company markets its other approved product  oncaspar  through marketing agreements in the us and canada with rpr and in europe with medac 
oncaspar revenues under the company s amended rpr us license agreement are comprised of manufacturing revenues  as well as royalties on sales of oncaspar by rpr 
oncaspar revenues for fiscal decreased due to a decline in manufacturing and royalty revenues resulting from difficulties encountered in the company s manufacturing process and the resulting changes in labeling and distribution described below 
during the company began to experience manufacturing problems with oncaspar 
the problems were due to an increase in the levels of particulates in batches of oncaspar which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
during fiscal  as a result of these manufacturing problems the company and the fda agreed to temporary labeling and distribution modifications for oncaspar 
the company  rather then rpr  took over distribution of oncaspar directly to patients on an as needed basis and instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution 
in addition during may  the fda required the company to limit distribution of the product to only those patients who are hypersensitive to native l asparaginase 
the company has been able to manufacture several batches of oncaspar which contain acceptable levels of particulates and anticipates a final resolution of the problem during fiscal it is expected that rpr will resume distribution of oncaspar at that time 
there can be no assurance that this solution will be acceptable to the fda 
if the company is unable to resolve this problem it is possible that the fda may not permit the company to continue to distribute this product 
an extended disruption in the marketing and distribution of oncaspar could have a material adverse impact on future oncaspar sales 
the company expects sales of adagen to increase at rates comparable to those achieved during the last two years as additional patients are treated 
the company also anticipates oncaspar sales will remain at reduced levels until the manufacturing problem is resolved and rpr resumes normal distribution of the product 
there can be no assurance that any particular sales levels of adagen or oncaspar will be achieved or maintained 
contract revenue for the year ended june  decreased to  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease was principally due to the fact that the company received milestone payments in under the company s licensing agreement for peg intron with schering plough and no such payments were received in during the year ended june   the company recognized  in milestone payments received as a result of schering plough advancing peg intron into a phase iii clinical trial 
peg intron is a modified form of schering plough s intron a interferon alfa b  recombinant  developed by enzon to have longer acting properties 
intron a is a genetically engineered anticancer and antiviral agent  developed and marketed worldwide by schering plough 
combined sales of intron a and rebetol by schering plough were million in the worldwide market for alpha interferon is estimated to be in excess of billion for all approved indications 
under the company s licensing agreement with schering plough  enzon will be entitled to royalties of peg intron sales and additional milestone payments 
during the years ended june  and  the company had export sales of  and  respectively 
of these amounts  sales in europe were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
revenues for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for fiscal sales increased by to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
the increase was due to an increase in adagen sales of approximately  resulting from an increase in patients receiving adagen treatment 
net sales of adagen  which is marketed by enzon  for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively 
oncaspar revenues in decreased due to a decline in manufacturing revenue resulting from difficulties encountered in the company s manufacturing process  previously discussed 
the decrease in manufacturing revenue was partially offset by increased royalties due to an increase in sales of oncaspar by rpr 
contract revenue for the year ended june  increased to  as compared to  for fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase in milestone payments received under the company s licensing agreement for peg intron with schering plough 
during the year ended june   the company recognized  in milestone payments received as a result of schering plough advancing peg intron into a phase iii clinical trial 
during the prior year  the company received a  milestone payment under the same licensing agreement with schering plough 
during the years ended june  and  the company had export sales of  and  respectively 
sales in europe were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to for the year ended june  as compared to in the increase was primarily due to a charge taken in the first quarter related to a write off of oncaspar finished goods on hand and in the distribution pipeline  as well as increased oncaspar production costs 
the increased write off of oncaspar finished goods was attributable to the manufacturing problems previously discussed 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for the year ended june  as compared to for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the prior year s expense of excess oncaspar raw material and purchase commitments related to the company s supply agreement for this material 
during the fiscal year ended june  the company amended its supply agreement for this material which extended the period available for the company to accept delivery of its remaining purchase commitment through  in exchange for a  advance payment of the remaining purchase commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased by to  from  last year 
the decrease in research and development expenses resulted from i a decrease in facility costs resulting from the elimination of a leased facility and the consolidation of research and development operations and ii a decline in clinical trial costs 
the decrease in clinical trial costs  was a result of the completion of a phase ib clinical trial for peg hemoglobin in research and development expenses are expected to increase to previous levels as a result of the commencement of phase i clinical trials for peg camptothecin 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  remained relatively unchanged at  as compared to  for the same period in the company s research and development efforts were focused on the continued development of its third generation pro drug transport technology  which included preclinical activities for prothecan peg camptothecin  as well as clinical trial costs for peg hemoglobin 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  as compared to  in the increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing and distribution costs for oncaspar 
due to the changes in distribution previously discussed  the company is responsible for all marketing and distribution for this product 
during the prior year these costs were the responsibility of rpr 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased by to  as compared to  for the year ended june  the increase was due to i increased investor and public relations activities  as well as ii consulting fees related to the development of a strategic business plan for the company s sca protein technology 
other income expense 
other income expense increased by  to  for the year ended june   as compared to  for last year 
the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income due to an increase in interest bearing investments 
other income expense decreased by  to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease was due principally to a decline in interest income due to a decrease in interest bearing investments 
liquidity and capital resources total cash reserves  including cash and cash equivalents as of june  were  as compared to  in the previous year 
the increase in total cash reserves was due to the completion of a private placement during july  in which the company sold  shares of common stock to a small group of investors resulting in net proceeds of approximately  the company invests its excess cash in a portfolio of high grade marketable securities and united states government backed securities 
the company s amended rpr license agreement for oncaspar provided for a payment of  in advance royalties which was received from rpr in january royalties due under the amended rpr license agreement will be offset against an original credit of  which represents the royalty advance plus reimbursement of certain amounts due rpr under the previous agreement and interest expense  before cash payments will be made under the agreement 
the royalty advance is shown as a long term liability  with the corresponding current portion included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets to be reduced as royalties are recognized under the agreement 
through june   an aggregate of  in royalties payable by rpr has been offset against the original credit 
as of june    shares of series a preferred shares had been converted into  shares of common stock 
accrued dividends on the converted series a preferred shares in the aggregate of  were settled by the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the company does not presently intend to pay cash dividends on the series a preferred shares 
as of june   there were accrued and unpaid dividends totaling  on the series a preferred shares 
these dividends are payable in cash or common stock at the company s option and accrue on the outstanding series a preferred shares at the rate of  per year 
the company and rpr are currently in discussions related to a disagreement over the purchase price of oncaspar under the supply agreement between the two companies 
rpr has asserted that the company has overcharged rpr under the supply agreement in the amount of  the company believes its costing and pricing of oncaspar to rpr complies with the supply agreement 
rpr has also asserted that the company should be responsible for its lost profits while oncaspar is under the temporary labeling and distribution modifications 
rpr contends that its lost profits through june  were  the company does not agree with rpr s claims 
the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of either matter will have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company is being sued  in the united states district court for the district of new jersey  by a former financial advisor asserting that under the may  letter agreement letter agreement between enzon and lbc capital resources inc lbc  lbc was entitled to a commission in connection with the company s january and march private placements  comprised of  and warrants to purchase  shares of enzon common stock at an exercise price of per share 
lbc has also asserted that it is entitled to an additional fee of  and warrants to purchase  shares of enzon common stock when and if any of the warrants obtained pursuant to the private placements are exercised 
lbc has claimed  in compensatory damages  plus punitive damages  counsel fees and costs for the alleged breach of the letter agreement 
the company believes that no such commission was due under the letter agreement and denies any liability under the letter agreement 
the company intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously and believes the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
to date  the company s sources of cash have been the proceeds from the sale of its stock through public and private placements  sales of adagen  sales of oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes  contract research and development fees  technology transfer and license fees and royalty advances 
the company s current sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents and interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of adagen  sales of oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes and license fees 
based upon its currently planned research and development activities and related costs and its current sources of liquidity  the company anticipates its current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet its capital and operational requirements for the foreseeable future 
upon exhaustion of the company s current cash reserves  the company s continued operations will depend on its ability to realize significant revenues from the commercial sale of its products  raise additional funds through equity or debt financing  or obtain significant licensing  technology transfer or contract research and development fees 
there can be no assurance that these sales  financings or revenue generating activities will be successful 
in management s opinion  the effect of inflation on the company s past operations has not been significant 
year the company has completed a review of its business systems  including its computer systems and manufacturing equipment  and has queried its customers and vendors as to their progress in identifying and addressing problems that their systems may face in correctly interrelating and processing date information as the year approaches and is reached 
based on this review  the company has implemented a plan to achieve year compliance 
the company believes that it will achieve year compliance in a manner which will be non disruptive to its operations 
in addition  the company has prepared various types of contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems and with suppliers and other third parties 
year compliance should not have a material adverse effect on the company  including the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
however  the company may encounter problems with suppliers and or revenue sources which could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
the company cannot accurately predict the occurrence and or outcome of any such problems  nor can the dollar amount of any such problem be estimated 
risk factors accumulated deficit and uncertainty of future profitability 
the company was originally incorporated in to date  the company s sources of cash have been the proceeds from the sale of its stock through public offerings and private placements  sales of its fda approved products  adagen r and oncaspar r  sales of its products for research purposes  contract research and development fees  technology transfer and license fees  and royalty advances 
at june   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  the company expects to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
to date  adagen and oncaspar are the only products of the company which have been approved for marketing in the united states by the fda  having been approved in march and february  respectively 
in addition  oncaspar has been approved for marketing in canada  germany and russia 
during the company began to experience manufacturing problems with oncaspar 
the problems were due to an increase in the levels of particulates in batches of oncaspar which resulted in an increased rejection rate for this product 
during fiscal  as a result of these manufacturing problems the company and the fda agreed to temporary labeling and distribution modifications for oncaspar 
the company  rather then rpr  took over distribution of oncaspar directly to patients on an as needed basis and instituted additional inspection and labeling procedures prior to distribution 
in addition during may the fda required the company to limit distribution of the product to only those patients who are hypersensitive to native l asparaginase 
the company has been able to manufacture several batches of oncaspar which contain acceptable levels of particulates and anticipates a final resolution of the problem during fiscal it is expected that rpr will resume distribution of oncaspar at that time 
there can be no assurance that this solution will be acceptable to the fda 
if the company is unable to resolve this problem it is possible that the fda may not permit the company to continue to distribute this product 
an extended disruption in the marketing and distribution of oncaspar could have a material adverse impact on future oncaspar sales 
in order to achieve profitable operations on a continuing basis  the company  either alone or through its partners  must successfully manufacture  market and sell its adagen and oncaspar products and develop  manufacture and market the company s products which are under development 
these products are in various stages of development  and the period necessary to achieve regulatory approval and market acceptance of any individual product is uncertain and typically lengthy  if achievable at all 
potential investors should be aware of the difficulties a biopharmaceutical enterprise such as the company encounters  especially in view of the intense competition in the pharmaceutical industry in which the company competes 
there can be no assurance that the company s plans will either materialize or prove successful  that its products under development will be successfully developed or that its products will generate revenues sufficient to enable the company to achieve profitability 
raw materials and dependence upon suppliers 
the company purchases the unmodified compounds utilized in its approved products and products under development from outside suppliers 
the company may be required to enter into supply contracts with outside suppliers for certain unmodified compounds 
the company does not produce the unmodified adenosine deaminase used in the manufacture of adagen  the unmodified forms of l asparaginase used in the manufacture of oncaspar and the unmodified camptothecin used in the company s prothecan r product which is under development and has a supply contract with an outside supplier for the supply of each of these unmodified compounds 
delays in obtaining or an inability to obtain any unmodified compound  including unmodified adenosine deaminase  unmodified l asparaginase  or unmodified camptothecin on reasonable terms  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event the company is required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in a product which is being sold commercially or which is in clinical development  the fda and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require the company to perform additional testing  which would cause delays and additional expenses  to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified compound previously used 
such evaluations could include chemical  pre clinical and clinical studies and could delay development of a product which is in clinical trials  limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause the company to incur significant additional expenses 
if such alternate material is not demonstrated to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound  the company will likely be required to repeat some or all of the pre clinical and clinical trials conducted for such compound 
the marketing of an fda approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted 
even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound  the fda or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require the company to conduct additional clinical trials with such alternate material 
patents and proprietary technology 
the company has licensed  and been issued  a number of patents in the united states and other countries and has other patent applications pending to protect its proprietary technology 
although the company believes that its patents provide certain protection from competition  there can be no assurance that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to the company  will afford the company adequate protection from competing products  will not be challenged or declared invalid  or that additional united states patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to the company 
the scope of patent claims for biotechnological inventions is uncertain and the company s patents and patent applications are subject to this uncertainty 
the company is aware of certain issued patents and patent applications belonging to third parties  and there may be other patents and patent applications  containing subject matter which the company or its licensees or collaborators may require in order to research  develop or commercialize at least some of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that licenses under such patents and patent applications will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if the company does not obtain such licenses  it or its partners could encounter delays in product market introductions while it attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed 
if the company does obtain such licenses it will in all likelihood be required to make royalty and other payments to the licensers  thus reducing the profits realized by the company from the products covered by such licenses 
the company is aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of the company s peg technology and sca patents 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enforce its patent and other rights against such organizations 
the company expects that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and other proprietary rights and  if enzon were to become involved in such litigation  it could consume a substantial amount of the company s resources 
in addition  the company relies heavily on its proprietary technologies for which pending patent applications have been filed and on unpatented know how developed by the company 
insofar as the company relies on trade secrets and unpatented know how to maintain its competitive technological position  there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies 
although the company has taken steps to protect its trade secrets and unpatented know how  third parties nonetheless may gain access to such information 
the company has two research and license agreements with the green cross corporation green cross regarding rhsa 
the company and yoshitomi pharmaceutical industries  ltd 
yoshitomi  the successor to green cross business  are currently in arbitration to resolve the amount of royalties that will be due the company  if any 
in april  yoshitomi filed documents in such arbitration seeking a declaratory judgment that under its agreement with the company no royalties are payable 
any adverse decision from such an arbitration proceeding could result in a material adverse effect to the company s future business  financial condition and results of operations 
research corporation technologies  inc research corporation held the original patent upon which the peg process is based and had granted the company a license under such patent 
research corporation s patent for the peg process in the united states and its corresponding foreign patents have expired 
although the company has obtained several improvement patents in connection with the peg process  there can be no assurance that any of these patents will enable the company to prevent infringement or that competitors will not develop competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by these patents 
the company is aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the united states and other countries with respect to the application of peg to proteins and other compounds 
based upon the expiration of the research corporation patent  other parties will be permitted to make  use  or sell products covered by the claims of the research corporation patent  subject to other patents  including those held by the company 
there can be no assurance that the expiration of the research corporation patent will not have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
limited sales and marketing experience  dependence on marketing partners 
other than adagen  which the company markets on a worldwide basis to a small patient population  the company does not engage in the direct commercial marketing of any of its products and therefore does not have significant sales and marketing experience 
for certain of its products  the company has provided exclusive marketing rights to its corporate partners in return for royalties to be received on sales 
with respect to oncaspar  the company has granted exclusive marketing rights in north america and the pacific rim to rpr 
the company has also granted exclusive marketing rights in europe and russia to medac gmbh and in israel to tzamal pharma ltd 
the company expects to retain marketing partners to market oncaspar in other foreign markets  principally south america 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will result in the company concluding such arrangements 
regarding the marketing of certain of the company s other future products  the company expects to evaluate whether to create a sales force to market certain products in the united states or to continue to enter into license and marketing agreements with others for united states and foreign markets 
these agreements generally provide that all or a significant portion of the marketing of these products will be conducted by the company s licensees or marketing partners 
in addition  under certain of these agreements  the company s licensees or marketing partners may have all or a significant portion of the development and regulatory approval responsibilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to control the amount and timing of resources that any licensee or marketing partner may devote to the company s products or prevent any licensee or marketing partner from pursuing alternative technologies or products that could result in the development of products that compete with the company s products and the withdrawal of support for the company s products 
should the licensee or marketing partner fail to develop a marketable product to the extent it is responsible for product development or fail to market a product successfully  if it is developed  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s marketing strategy will be successful 
under the company s marketing and license agreements  the company s marketing partners and licensees may have the right to terminate the agreements and abandon the applicable products at any time for any reason without significant payments 
the company is aware that certain of its marketing partners are pursuing parallel development of products on their own and with other collaborative partners which may compete with the licensed products and there can be no assurance that the company s other current or future marketing partners will not also pursue such parallel courses 
reimbursement from third party payors 
sales of the company s products will be dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  such as governmental health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
government and other third party payors are increasingly sensitive to the containment of health care costs and are limiting both coverage and levels of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing  and are refusing  in some cases  to provide any coverage for indications for which the fda and other national health regulatory authorities have not granted marketing approval 
there can be no assurance that such third party payor reimbursement will be available or will permit the company to sell its products at price levels sufficient for it to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development 
since patients who receive adagen will be required to do so for their entire lives unless a cure or another treatment is developed  lifetime limits on benefits which are included in most private health insurance policies could permit insurers to cease reimbursement for adagen 
lack of or inadequate reimbursement by government and other third party payors for the company s products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the united states and abroad is subject to stringent governmental regulation and the sale of any of the company s products for use in humans in the united states will require the prior approval of the fda 
similar approvals by comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries 
the fda has established mandatory procedures and safety standards which apply to the clinical testing  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are also regulated by state  local and other authorities 
obtaining fda approval for a new therapeutic may take several years and involve substantial expenditures 
adagen was approved by the fda in march oncaspar was approved by the fda in february  in germany in november and in canada in in each case for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who are hypersensitive to native forms of l asparaginase 
oncaspar was approved in russia for therapeutic use in a broad range of cancers 
except for these approvals  none of the company s other products have been approved for sale and use in humans in the united states or elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain fda approval for any of its other products 
in addition  any approved products are subject to continuing regulation  and noncompliance by the company with applicable requirements can result in criminal penalties  civil penalties  fines  recall or seizure  injunctions requiring suspension of production  orders requiring ongoing supervision by the fda or refusal by the government to approve marketing or export applications or to allow the company to enter into supply contracts 
failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or failure to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested  will delay or preclude the company or its licensees or marketing partners from marketing their products  or limit the commercial use of the products  and thereby may have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition and risk of technological obsolescence 
many established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with resources greater than those of the company are engaged in activities that are competitive with the company s and may develop products or technologies which compete with those of the company 
the company is aware that other companies are engaged in utilizing peg technology in developing drug products 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not successfully develop  manufacture and market competing products utilizing peg technology or otherwise 
other drugs or treatment modalities which are currently available or that may be developed in the future  and which treat the same diseases as those which the company s products are designed to treat  may be competitive with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological development by others may result in the company s products becoming obsolete before the company recovers a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to those products 
the company s success  in large part  depends upon developing and maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in its area of focus 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than any which are being sold or developed by the company or which would render the company s technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive 
the company s failure to develop and maintain a competitive position with respect to its products and or technologies would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of market acceptance 
the company s products  oncaspar and adagen  have been approved by the fda to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a rare form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease  respectively 
neither product has become widely used due to the small patient population and limited indications approved by the fda 
the company s current research and development efforts are focused on applying its proprietary technologies to compounds of known therapeutic efficacy in order to enhance the performance of these compounds 
assuming that the company is able to develop such compounds and secure the requisite fda approvals  the market acceptance of any such products will depend upon the acceptance by the medical community of the use of such technologies 
there can be no assurance that any additional products will be approved by the fda or that  if approved  the medical community will use them 
in addition  the use of any such new products will depend upon the extent of third party medical reimbursement  increased awareness of the effectiveness of such technologies and sales efforts by the company or any marketing partner 
the company s proprietary peg technology has received only limited market acceptance to date 
failure of the company to develop new fda approved products and to achieve market acceptance for such products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
potential product liability 
the use of the company s products during testing or after regulatory approval entails an inherent risk of adverse effects which could expose the company to product liability claims 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in the total amount of million for claims arising from the use of its products in clinical trials prior to fda approval and for claims arising from the use of its products after fda approval 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing insurance coverage or obtain coverage for the use of its other products in the future 
there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage and the resources of the company would be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional financing 
the company s current sources of liquidity are its cash reserves  and interest earned on such cash reserves  sales of adagen and oncaspar  sales of its products for research purposes  and license fees 
there can be no assurance as to the level of sales of the company s fda approved products  adagen and oncaspar  or the amount of royalties realized from the commercial sale of oncaspar pursuant to the company s licensing agreements 
total cash reserves  including short term investments  as of june   were approximately  based upon its currently planned research and development activities and related costs and its current sources of liquidity  the company anticipates its current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet its capital and operational requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s future needs and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the successful commercialization of its products  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  progress with regulatory affairs activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing for its currently planned capital and operational requirements 
in addition  the company may seek to acquire additional technology  enter into strategic alliances and engage in additional research and development programs  which may require additional financing 
the company does not have any committed sources of additional financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent the company is unable to obtain financing  it may be required to curtail its activities or sell additional securities 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing fund raising activities will successfully meet the company s anticipated cash needs 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
dividend policy and restrictions 
the company has paid no dividends on its common stock  since its inception and does not plan to pay dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
except as may be utilized to pay the dividends payable on the company s series a cumulative convertible preferred stock the series a preferred stock  any earnings which the company may realize will be retained to finance the growth of the company 
in addition  the terms of the series a preferred stock restrict the payment of dividends on other classes and series of stock 
possible volatility of stock price 
historically  the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated over a wide range and it is likely that the price of the common stock will fluctuate in the future 
announcements regarding technical innovations  the development of new products  the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements  regulatory approvals  patent or proprietary rights or other developments by the company or its competitors could have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
in addition  due to one or more of the foregoing factors  in one or more future quarters  the company s results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of the company s common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
anti takeover considerations 
the company has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock of the company in one or more series and to fix the powers  designations  preferences and relative rights thereof without any further vote of shareholders 
the issuance of such preferred stock could dilute the voting powers of holders of common stock and could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and by laws  including those providing for a staggered board of directors  as well as delaware law  may operate in a manner that could discourage or render more difficult a takeover of the company or the removal of management or may limit the price certain investors may be willing to pay for shares of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of debt securities  and time deposits 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate or return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum  and at june  all of our holdings were in instruments maturing in one year or less
