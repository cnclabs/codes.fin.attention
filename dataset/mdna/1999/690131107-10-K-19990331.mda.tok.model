item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
due to these acquisitions  as well as new offices opened by the company  during this period the number of company owned staffing and peo offices increased from ten to and the number of metropolitan markets measured by metropolitan statistical areas  or msas served by company owned locations increased from one to in order to support its growth  the company implemented new information systems  further developed back office capabilities and invested in other infrastructure enhancements 
staffing companies provide four basic services to clients i flexible staffing  ii peo services  iii placement and search  and iv outplacement 
based on information provided by the national association of temporary and staffing services  the national association of professional employer organizations and staffing industry analysts  inc  staffing industry revenues were approximately billion 
according to industry sources  flexible staffing firms and peo firms employed approximately million people per day  or approximately of the entire united states workforce  in over the last five years  the staffing industry has experienced significant growth  due largely to the utilization of temporary help across a broader range of industries as well as the emergence of the peo sector 
according to the national association of temporary and staffing services  the staffing industry grew from approximately billion in to approximately billion in  or 
during that same period  the industrial staffing sector grew from approximately billion to approximately billion  or 
during  the industrial staffing sector represented of the staffing industry  compared to during the company believes that the industrial staffing market is highly fragmented and that in excess of of industrial staffing revenues are generated by small local and regional companies 
the peo sector  the fastest growing sector within the staffing industry  comprised an estimated billion  or approximately  of estimated staffing industry revenues 
this sector has grown at an estimated compound annual rate over the last five years as small and medium size businesses businesses with less than employees continued to realize time and cost savings associated with outsourcing human resources activities to peos 
according to industry sources  less than of small and medium size businesses in the united states utilize peo services 
the company s operation of both a staffing division and a peo division provides it with significant competitive advantages 
both tandem and synadyne offer a number of common services including payroll administration  risk management and benefits administration 
the company designs and administers these services through common facilities  personnel and information systems which give the company the ability to develop and provide a wider range of services at lower costs than its primary competitors 
in addition  the company is able to provide a full spectrum of staffing services to its industrial clients ranging from a temporary employee for one day to comprehensive outsourcing of human resources functions through the company s peo division 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information regarding acquisitions and other growth  revenues and other operating information for the company s primary areas of operations  seasonality  and practices related to working capital items 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding operating segment information 
the company s objective is to become the leading provider of staffing and peo services in select geographic regions 
to achieve this objective  the company s strategy is to i provide a comprehensive package of single source human resources services  ii continue to focus on under served industrial staffing and peo markets which provide high growth opportunities  iii geographically cluster offices to leverage economic efficiencies and maintain a stable employment base  iv increase market penetration through a combination of internal growth  acquisitions  franchising and strategic alliances  v continue to maximize operating efficiencies through integrated technology and back office support and  ultimately  vi to become the guardian employer  whereby the company will represent a critical mass of jobs within a defined geographic area enabling it to commit to permanent employment  over time  for its staffing and peo employees 
company services the company offers its clients a full array of staffing services through its tandem and synadyne divisions 
tandem focuses on meeting its clients industrial staffing needs  targeting opportunities in that fragmented  rapidly growing market which has to date been under served by large full service staffing companies 
significant benefits of tandem s services include the client s ability to outsource the recruiting and many logistical aspects of meeting its staffing needs  as well as the benefits of converting the fixed cost of employees to the variable cost of outsourced services 
synadyne focuses on providing professional employer organization services to small and medium sized businesses those with less than employees  which achieves cost savings arising from the economies of scale associated with this outsourcing of human resources administration 
because the company serves as the employer of record with respect to both peo and staffing services  the company provides certain common services to both of these markets  utilizing a common support system 
the degree of utilization of these common services depends upon the needs of the clients and employees 
common services offered by both tandem and synadyne include payroll administration 
the company assumes responsibility for payroll and attendant record keeping  payroll tax deposits  payroll tax reporting  and all federal  state  county and city payroll tax reports including s  s  w s  w s  w s and w s  state unemployment taxes  employee file maintenance  unemployment claims and monitoring and responding to changing regulatory requirements 
the company develops and administers customized payroll policies and procedures for each of its clients  which are fully integrated from the clients offices to the company s central processing center 
aggregation of statutory and non statutory employee benefits 
employee benefits packages can include health care options  such as preferred provider organizations ppos and health maintenance organizations hmos  and supplemental benefit programs such as dental care  vision care  prescription drugs  an employee assistance plan and life and disability insurance options 
the company offers multiple employer retirement plans and cafeteria plans to its eligible employees and provides workers compensation and unemployment insurance 
workers compensation is a state mandated comprehensive insurance program that requires employers to fund medical expenses  lost wages and other costs that result from work related injuries and illnesses  regardless of fault and without any co payment by the employee 
unemployment insurance is an insurance tax imposed by both federal and state governments 
as part of its service package  the company administers all employee benefit plans and is responsible for negotiating the benefits provided by  and costs of  each such plan 
the company s human resources and claims administration departments serve as liaisons for the delivery of such services to the client employee and monitor and review workers compensation claims for loss control purposes 
the company believes that its ability to provide and administer a wide variety of employee benefit plans on behalf of its clients tends to mitigate the competitive disadvantages small businesses normally face in the areas of employee benefits cost control and employee recruiting and retention 
human resources compliance administration 
because the company is the employer of record with respect to both flexible staffing and peo services and assumes responsibility for compliance with many employment related regulations  it is prepared and trained to address compliance and regulatory issues inherent in an employment relationship 
for example  the company provides compliance administration services with respect to unemployment claims  workers compensation claims  and claims arising under the fair labor standards act 
in addition  the company assists its clients in understanding and complying with other employment related requirements for which the company does not assume responsibility 
generally  the most significant compliance administration services provided by the company are in the area of workers compensation and state unemployment laws 
with respect to workers compensation  the company provides claims management services which include prompt identification and reporting of injuries to the insurance carrier and local branch office  use of designated health care providers  case management  fee audits and aggressive back to work programs 
services provided by the company in the area of state unemployment compliance include ensuring that only eligible personnel receive unemployment benefits  assisting in re employing personnel and auditing state reporting records and rate formulas 
proactive human resources management services 
synadyne peo services are referred to by the company as proactive human resources management services 
peo services are typically provided for an indefinite time frame  while staffing assignments are normally contracted for a definite period of time with the flexibility to meet ongoing business demands 
in addition  staffing services are often bundled for one base fee  while peo services are characterized by a base fee  plus additional fees for added services 
as part of its base services in both the staffing and peo markets  the company conducts a human resources needs analysis for clients and client employees 
based on the results of that review  the company recommends basic and additional services that the client should implement 
set forth below are examples of suggested services included within the company s base service fee and other services provided on fee for service basis in the staffing and peo sectors 
staffing peo service base fee base fee fee for service o continuous h r review and analysis x x o screening x x o recruiting x x o training x x o workforce deployment x x o loss prevention and safety training x x o pre employment testing and assessment x x o background searches x x o compensation program design x x o customized personnel management reports x x o job profiling  description  application x x o turnover tracking and analysis x x o customer service training x x the company provides certain other services to its peo clients on a fee for service basis that are also available to its staffing clients 
these services include drug testing policy administration  outplacement assistance  relocation assistance  executive benefits  affirmative action plans  opinion surveys and follow up analysis  exit interviews and follow up analysis  management development skills workshops  team building programs  grammar and business correspondence skills workshops and management skills assessment 
operations because of the similarities in the type of services that the company offers to its peo and staffing clients  and due to technological and communication advances  many of these services are provided from the company s national office and support center in deerfield beach  florida 
these services include payroll processing  tax reporting  unemployment claims  workers compensation and other insurance claims  insurance procurement  health and other employee benefits administration  design and production of training programs and materials  accounting  billing and collections  customized management reporting  employee background checks  pre employment testing  affirmative action plans  executive recruiting  executive benefits  compensation program design  and turnover tracking and analysis 
tandem tandem delivers its staffing services through a nationwide network of company owned and franchise recruiting and training centers 
most company owned recruiting and training centers are staffed with a manager  one or two service and recruiting coordinators  two to four staffing consultants  an office administrator and one to four clerical assistants 
some of the centers identified above as company owned are vendor on premise locations  where the company has a permanent administrative presence at a client s worksite 
the number of people in each of the positions will vary by the size of the recruiting and training centers and degree of penetration of their territory within the market 
the company believes that its success is due in part to its close familiarity with the businesses of its clients 
the company s sales consultants visit client job sites regularly to become familiar with the skill required by the client s business  conduct job site safety inspections and to ensure that employees are appropriately equipped for the job 
to ensure customer satisfaction  tandem sales consultants and service coordinators play an active role in daily work assignments 
the company also familiarizes itself with its pool of industrial employees 
each employee is subject to a two day screening process that evaluates skills  abilities and attitudes 
this not only permits the company to institute appropriate training programs and assign its workers  but also helps the company retain desirable employees 
synadyne synadyne delivers basic peo services through client service teams consisting of human resource professionals and payroll and benefits specialists located in each of the two florida markets the company serves 
the client service team is assigned as soon as the company s account executive has secured the client  thus allowing the account executive to concentrate on sales of peo services to additional clients 
although the client service teams have primary responsibility for servicing their assigned clients  they rely on the company s national support center staff to provide advice in specialized areas such as workers compensation  unemployment insurance and payroll processing 
the client s principal contact within the client service team is the human resources professional  whose level of expertise is tailored to each client depending upon the nature and complexity of the client s business 
the company believes that its team approach ultimately results in maximum client satisfaction 
sales and marketing the company markets its services through two primary marketing channels  direct sales and franchising 
the company believes this dual channel approach allows the company to quickly access a pool of skilled employees  develop regional brand awareness and ultimately become a market leader 
the company believes its compound annual revenue growth rate of approximately from to demonstrates the success of this dual channel approach 
during  the company terminated the three existing synadyne franchise agreements and suspended sales of additional synadyne franchises  pending an overall determination of the best mix of all peo distribution channels  including franchising 
the company continues to market its peo business on a direct sales basis 
o direct sales force 
the company believes there are significant differences in the initial sales process and sales cycle between staffing and peo services sales 
as a result  the company markets these services through three distinct  highly trained sales forces that share a common profile 
staffing services are marketed through sales associates located in company owned tandem offices nationwide 
the company s peo services are marketed from the company s national support center  which includes a telemarketing center  as well as through sales associates located in another synadyne office in florida 
the company s peo sales associates focus on full service peo clients while the telemarketing center staff concentrates on the company s small business peo clients those with fewer than ten employees 
although the sales process and sales cycle are different between the staffing and peo businesses  the method and philosophy that the company employs in the selection  training and compensation of its sales force is very similar 
it is the company s philosophy to employ the best sales force available  and all of the company s sales associates receive a competitive compensation package that includes  in some cases  commissions during the life of the client s relationship with the company 
all sales associates receive two weeks of initial classroom and on the job training and attend additional training sessions on a regular basis 
the additional training is conducted by specialists and by sales managers of the respective divisions 
franchising 
the company offers franchising arrangements for its industrial staffing business 
under staffing franchising agreements  the company grants the franchisee the exclusive right to operate under the tandem trade name within a select geographic market in return for a royalty on staffing services rendered 
the franchisee assumes the marketing costs and  as a result  the company believes franchising is a cost effective method of building regional brand awareness in secondary and tertiary markets 
as of march   there were tandem franchise locations 
the company has franchised synadyne and office ours on a limited basis in the past  but is not currently actively marketing these franchises  and as of march  no such franchises were active 
clients the tandem division has approximately  clients and provides services to approximately  of such clients each day 
these clients represent a cross section of the industrial sector  of which no single client represents more than of the company s total revenues 
tandem s clients include national companies such as browning ferris industries  inc  michelin corporation  toys r us  inc and waste management  inc  plus a number of regional companies 
synadyne provides peo services to approximately  companies 
these companies represent a diverse range of industries  including insurance and staffing 
the company s primary peo client in the insurance industry is allstate insurance 
the company provides basic peo services for approximately  allstate agents  each of whom has selected the company from among allstate s approved providers 
the company s primary peo clients in the staffing industry are its tandem franchises  in that the company provides basic peo services to the employees of some of its franchises 
for the year ended december   approximately and of the company s total peo revenues were attributed to services provided to allstate insurance and its agents and to tandem franchises  respectively 
the company attempts to maintain diversity within its client base in order to decrease its exposure to downturns or volatility in any particular industry  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such diversity or decrease its exposure to such volatility 
as part of this client selection strategy  the company currently offers its services only to those businesses that operate in certain industries  eliminating industries that it believes present a higher risk of employee injury such as roofing  excavation  chemical manufacturing and maritime 
all prospective clients undergo a rigorous underwriting process to evaluate workers compensation risk  group medical history  creditworthiness  unemployment history and operating stability 
generally  staffing clients do not sign long term contracts 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding significant customers and geographical concentration 
competition the staffing market is highly fragmented  characterized by many small providers in addition to several large public companies  with at least one other public company focused primarily on industrial staffing 
there are limited barriers to entry and new competitors frequently enter the market 
although a large percentage of staffing providers are locally operated with fewer than five offices  many of the large public companies have significantly greater marketing  financial and other resources than the company 
unlike the company  almost all of these companies do not focus primarily on industrial staffing 
the company believes that by focusing primarily on industrial staffing  it enjoys a competitive advantage over many of its competitors that attempt to provide a broader range of temporary employees 
the company also believes that by targeting regional and emerging companies  rather than the national companies that are generally being pursued by its competitors  it can also gain certain competitive advantages 
the company believes that there are several factors that must be met in order to obtain and retain clients in the staffing market 
these factors include an adequate number of well located offices  an understanding of clients specific job requirements  the ability to reliably provide the correct number of employees on time  the ability to monitor job performance  and the ability to offer competitive prices 
to attract qualified industrial candidates for flexible employment assignments  companies must offer competitive wages  vacations and holiday pay  positive work environments  flexibility of work schedules  and an adequate number of available work hours 
the company believes it is highly competitive in these areas in the chicago market and is reasonably competitive in the other markets in which it competes  although there can be no assurance that such competitive standing can be maintained in the future 
competition in the highly fragmented peo sector is generally on a local or regional basis  and new competitors frequently enter the market 
several larger peo competitors have completed initial public offerings during the past three years 
the primary competitive factors in this sector are quality of service  choice and quality of benefits  reputation and price 
the company believes that name recognition  regulatory expertise  financial resources  risk management  and data processing capability distinguish leading peos from the rest of the industry and that the company is competitive in all of these areas in the markets in which it competes 
the company s competitors include i in house human resource departments  ii other peos and iii providers of discrete employment related services such as payroll processing firms  commercial insurance brokers  human resource consultants and temporary help firms who might enter the peo market 
some of these companies have greater financial and other resources than the company 
the company believes that barriers to entry are increasing and are greater than those of the staffing business 
some of the barriers to entry include i the complexity of the peo business and the need for expertise in multiple disciplines  ii the number of years of experience required to establish experience ratings in key cost areas of workers compensation  health insurance  and unemployment  iii the need for sophisticated management information systems to track all aspects of business in a high growth environment and iv increased regulations and licensing requirements in many states 
risk management program workers compensation the company believes that careful client selection  pro active accident prevention programs  and aggressive control of claims will result in reduced workers compensation costs 
the company seeks to prevent workplace injuries by implementing a variety of training  safety  and mandatory drug free workplace programs including pre employment screening  random testing  and post accident drug monitoring to ensure that safety awareness is heightened at the sites to which the company sends its workers 
further  the company insists that clients adhere to ongoing safety practices at the client worksites as a necessary condition to a continued business relationship 
each month  the risk management team  comprised of professionals from a variety of functional areas  reviews workplace accidents for the relevant period to determine the appropriate reserves 
each quarter  all cases are reviewed to reconcile the reserves  payments  and expected future costs for each case 
the company believes it has maintained adequate reserves for all of its workers compensation claims 
in addition  the company has selected special risk services for third party claims administration and novaeon care management for medical case management 
each vendor has established designated regional teams for the handling of the company s workers compensation claims 
a company in house claims analyst manages each regional team 
all claims arising within a given region are reported to the claims analyst who verifies the employment of the claimant and assigns the claim to special risk services and novaeon  for defense and or processing 
together  the team of the in house analyst  the third party administrator and medical case manager aggressively follow each claim from its origin to its conclusion 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a description of the financial terms of the program 
information technology the company believes that the effective use of technology to increase operational efficiency and enhance client service is a key factor in remaining competitive 
the company has developed  and continues to invest in  information support systems at its company owned and franchise locations  as well as the national office and support center 
at the field level  custom developed systems support the day to day operational needs of both tandem and office ours 
another specialized system provides support for synadyne 
at the national office and support center  centralized accounting  billing and reporting applications provide support for all of the operating divisions  including the tandem and office ours field offices 
in november  the company entered into a series of major projects to expand its information infrastructure and replace  or re develop  many of its major operational systems in order to support future growth 
the initial phase of the project was an installation of a company wide database management system that now provides consistency across all applications and allows information to move between applications 
this allows for consolidated reporting and analysis across all of the company s divisions 
the second phase of the project  completed in february  implemented an integrated financial management system for all accounting functions to streamline the central processing of billing and financial reporting 
the third phase of the project  completed in november  was the development of a state of the art system to support synadyne 
since no comprehensive  commercially available system exists for the peo industry  the company entered into a developmental agreement with fw davison  a provider of human resource and benefit systems  to produce a system tailored to the needs of synadyne 
the final phase of the project  now in its final implementation phase  is the development of a new support system for the tandem and office ours offices that uses a centrally based processing resource 
each field office is or will be connected to a central processor  via a frame relay network connection 
this new system will be implemented in all company owned offices by may  industry regulation overview as an employer  the company is subject to federal  state and local statutes and regulations governing its relationships with its employees and affecting businesses generally  including  in many respects  employees at client worksites 
in addition  as a result of its peo operations  the company is affected by applicable licensing and other regulatory requirements and by uncertainty in the application of numerous federal and state laws relating to labor  tax and employment matters 
uncertainty as to the employer relationship by entering into a co employment relationship with worksite employees  the company assumes certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state laws 
many of these federal and state laws were enacted prior to the development of nontraditional employment relationships  such as peos  temporary employment  and outsourcing arrangements  and do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of peos 
whether certain laws apply to the company depends in many cases upon whether the company is deemed to be an employer for purposes of the law 
the definition of employer under these laws is not uniform and  therefore  the application of these laws to the company s business is not always certain 
in many cases  a person s status as an employer is determined by application of a common law test involving the examination of several factors to determine an employer employee relationship 
uncertainty as to the application of certain laws governing employer relationships is particularly important to the company in federal tax and employee benefit matters 
federal and state employment taxes 
the company assumes the sole responsibility and liability for the payment of federal and state employment taxes with respect to wages and salaries paid to its employees  including worksite employees 
to date  the irs has relied extensively on the common law test of employment in determining employer status and the resulting liability for failure to withhold  however  the irs has formed an examination division market segment specialization program for the purpose of examining selected peos throughout the united states 
upon examination  the irs may determine that a peo is not the employer of the worksite employees under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code applicable to federal employment taxes and  consequently  that the client companies are exclusively responsible for payment of employment taxes on wages and salaries paid to such employees 
a determination by the irs that the company is not the employer of the worksite employees may impact the company s ability to report employment taxes for its own account rather than for the accounts of its clients and would increase administrative burdens on the company s payroll service function 
in addition  while the company believes that it can contractually assume the client company s withholding obligations  in the event the company fails to meet these obligations the client company may be held jointly and severally liable 
the company s management believes that the financial condition and reputation of the company in the past has prevented this potential liability from discouraging prospective clients 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to prevent this potential liability in the future 
employee benefit plans 
the company offers various benefit plans to its worksite employees 
these plans include a multiple employer retirement plan  a cafeteria plan  a group health plan  a group life insurance plan  a group disability insurance plan and an employee assistance plan 
generally  employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  the plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of the company s employees 
an irs examination of the company and or a client company may determine that the company is not the employer of worksite employees under code provisions applicable to employee benefit plans 
consequently  the company may not be able to offer worksite employees benefit plans that qualify for favorable tax treatment 
if the irs were to conclude that the company is not the employer of its worksite employees for plan purposes  those employees could not continue to make tax favored contributions to the company s multiple employer retirement plans or cafeteria plan 
the company believes that  although unfavorable to the company  a prospective application by the irs of an adverse conclusion would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations 
if such conclusion were applied retroactively  employees vested account balances may become taxable immediately  the company would lose its tax deduction to the extent the contributions were not vested  the plan trust would become a taxable trust and penalties could be assessed 
in such a scenario  the company would face the risk of client dissatisfaction  as well as potential litigation 
a retroactive application by the irs of an adverse conclusion could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
while the company believes that a retroactive disqualification is unlikely  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate resolution of these issues 
employee pension and welfare benefit plans are also governed by erisa 
the united states supreme court has held that the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under erisa 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a peo arrangement has not been established 
if the company were found not to be an employer for erisa purposes  its plans would not be subject to erisa 
as a result of such finding  the company and its plans would not enjoy the preemption of state law provided by erisa and could be subject to varying state laws and regulations  as well as to claims based upon state common laws 
workers compensation workers compensation is a state mandated  comprehensive insurance program that requires employers to fund medical expenses  lost wages and other costs resulting from work related injuries and illnesses 
in exchange for providing workers compensation coverage for employees  employers are generally immune from any liability for benefits in excess of those provided by the relevant state statutes 
in most states  the extensive benefits coverage for both medical costs and lost wages is provided through the purchase of commercial insurance from private insurance companies  participation in state run insurance funds  self insurance funds or  if permitted by the state  employer self insurance 
workers compensation benefits and arrangements vary on a state by state basis and are often highly complex 
the company s ability to use comprehensive workers compensation managed care techniques in its peo operations depends in part on its ability to contract with or create networks of health care providers 
the company requires that injured workers use the company s network of providers 
laws regulating the operation of managed care provider networks have been adopted by a number of states 
these laws may apply to managed care provider networks having contracts with the company or to provider networks that the company may organize 
to the extent the company is governed by these regulations  it may be subject to additional licensing requirements  financial oversight and procedural standards for beneficiaries and providers 
see risk management program workers compensation 
peo licensing requirements approximately one third of the states  including florida  have passed laws that have licensing or registration requirements for peos and several additional states are considering such regulation 
such laws vary from state to state but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of peos 
state regulation assists in screening insufficiently capitalized peo operations and  in the company s view  has the effect of legitimizing the peo industry generally by resolving interpretative issues concerning employee status for specific purposes under applicable state law 
existing regulations are relatively new and  therefore  limited interpretive or enforcement guidance is available 
the company cannot predict with certainty the nature or direction of the development of federal  state and local regulations 
in florida  the company s peo operations are licensed under the florida employee leasing licensing act of the florida licensing act 
among other things  the florida licensing act requires peos and their controlling persons to be licensed  mandates reporting requirements  allocates several employer responsibilities and requires the payment of an annual licensing fee based upon gross payroll amounts 
the florida licensing act also requires licensed peos to submit annual audited financial statements and to maintain a tangible accounting net worth and positive working capital 
in addition  the florida licensing act requires peos to i reserve the right of direction and control over leased employees  ii enter into written agreements with their clients  iii pay wages to leased employees  iv pay and collect payroll taxes  v maintain authority to hire  terminate  discipline and reassign employees and vi retain a right of direction and control over management of safety  risk and hazard control at the worksite or sites affecting its leased employees  including the responsibility to perform safety inspections  to promulgate and administer employment and safety policies  and to manage workers compensation claims  claim filings  and related procedures

effective july   the company entered into a five year financing arrangement under which it can sell up to a million secured interest in its eligible accounts receivable to eaglefunding capital corporation eagle  which uses the receivables to secure a rated commercial paper the securitization facility 
under this arrangement  the company receives cash equivalent to the gross outstanding balance of the accounts receivable being sold  less reserves which are adjusted on a monthly basis based on collection experience and other defined factors 
there is no recourse to the company for the initial funds received 
amounts collected in excess of the reserves are retained by the company 
the company s interest rate  payable on the balance of the outstanding commercial paper  is determined by prevailing interest rates in the commercial paper market and was approximately as of december  as of december   a million interest in the company s uncollected accounts receivable had been sold under this agreement  which amount is excluded from the accounts receivable balance presented in the company s consolidated financial statements

amounts drawn under the liquidity facility bear interest at the same rates incurred under the revolving credit facility 
the company is currently discussing renewal of the liquidity facility with the syndicate and other banks 
concurrent with the securitization facility  the revolving facility was amended  primarily to reduce the maximum amount available for borrowing from million to million and to extend the remaining term of the revolving facility to five years from the date of that amendment 
outstanding amounts under the revolving facility are secured by substantially all of the company s assets and the pledge of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of each of its subsidiaries

the company regularly evaluates its compliance with the financial covenants included in the revolving credit facility 
the company believes  based on its current projections  that it will be in compliance with those covenants throughout  although the company expects certain covenants to remain close to the current limitations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be in compliance with those covenants at march  or that it will not require waivers from the syndicate of lenders led by bankboston  na  regarding compliance with those covenants as of that date  or at subsequent dates 
in the event waivers are required  but are not granted  the company could experience liquidity problems depending on the ability and willingness of the syndicate of lenders to continue lending to the company  and the availability and cost of financing from other sources 
in february  the company entered into a five year notional million interest rate collar agreement with bank boston  na  whereby the company receives interest on that notional amount to the extent day libor exceeds per annum  and pays interest on that amount to the extent day libor is less than per annum

cash used in financing activities during was approximately million  comprised primarily of million in net repayments of the revolving facility and million of repayments of long term debt  offset by an increase in the company s liability for outstanding checks in excess of the funded bank balances of million 
the net reduction of the revolving facility balance during was primarily due to the company s application of proceeds received from the sale of its trade accounts receivable under the securitization facility 
cash provided by financing activities during was approximately million  including million net proceeds from the offering and million from borrowings under the revolving facility  substantially offset by payments of million for shareholders distributions and other amounts in connection with the reorganization and million of repayments of long term debt net of note repayments from related parties 
prior to  the company secured its workers compensation obligations by the issuance of bank standby letters of credit to its insurance carriers  minimizing the required current cash outflow for such items 
in  the company selected a prefunded deductible program whereby expected claims expenses are funded in advance in exchange for reductions in administrative costs 
the required advance funding will be provided through either cash flows from operations or additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
this new arrangement could adversely affect the company s ability to meet certain financial covenants 
although the company s workers compensation expense for claims is effectively capped at a contractually agreed upon percentage of payroll and cannot exceed these amounts for the respective fiscal years  this limit was increased to for calendar  from in  reflecting the inclusion of general and automobile liability coverage as well as an adjustment based on the changing business mix of the company 
one of the key elements of the company s growth strategy in and has been expansion through acquisitions  which require significant sources of financing  however the company does not expect to complete further acquisitions until its internal growth and the united states manufacturing environment improves 
the financing sources for acquisitions include cash from operations  seller financing  bank financing and issuances of the company s common stock 
the company s previous acquisitions have been primarily in the industrial staffing area  and when it resumes acquisition activity  the company expects this trend to continue due to the more favorable pricing for those businesses as a multiple of ebitda as compared to peo businesses 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company is a service business and therefore a majority of its tangible assets are customer accounts receivable 
staffing employees are paid by the company on a daily or weekly basis 
the company  however  receives payment from customers for these services  on average  to days from the presentation date of the invoice 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company experienced an increase in the percentage of its staffing accounts receivable that are past due 
as a result  the company has taken several actions  including among other things increasing the number of employees focusing on accounts receivable issues and establishing employee compensation plans based on satisfactory collections  which it believes will satisfactorily address this issue so that there is no adverse long term impact to the company 
as new staffing offices are established or acquired  or as existing offices expand  there will be increasing requirements for cash to fund operations 
the company pays its peo employees on a weekly  bi weekly  semi monthly or monthly basis for their services  and currently receives payments on a simultaneous basis from approximately based on revenues of its existing customers  with the remainder paying on average to days from the presentation date of the invoice 
the company anticipates spending up to million during the next twelve months to open new staffing locations  improve its management information and operating systems  upgrade existing and acquired locations and other capital expenditures 
this amount does not include expenditures for goodwill or other intangible assets arising from acquisitions  which the company does not expect to be significant in in order to remain in compliance with certain covenants in its revolving credit facility  and to reduce the cash impact of scheduled payments under its subordinated acquisition debt  the company has put into place a plan to renegotiate the payment terms of its subordinated acquisition debt 
pursuant to such plan  the company has negotiated extensions of the payment dates of certain of the subordinated notes and is in the process of negotiating the remainder of such notes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in renegotiating all remaining subordinated notes 
in the event it is not successful  and the company elects not to pay a scheduled payment  this could result in a default being declared by the noteholder against the company  which would subject the company to lawsuits commenced by the note holders to recover the indebtedness due 
the company is currently completing negotiations with certain financial institutions to borrow approximately million  repayable over years at an interest rate of approximately per annum 
the loan would be secured by property and equipment currently owned by the company and the proceeds would be used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  creating additional availability thereunder 
the company believes that funds provided by operations  including sales of accounts receivable under the securitization facility  plus borrowings under the revolving facility and current cash balances will be sufficient to meet its presently anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures  not including new acquisitions  for the next twelve months 
significant new acquisitions will require expanded or new borrowing facilities  issuance of common stock and or additional debt or equity offerings 
the ability of the company to make significant future acquisitions is also subject to the company s ability to successfully negotiate more flexible leverage eg  debt to ebitda covenants compared to those presently contained in the revolving facility and or the company s ability to finance future acquisitions by issuance of its common stock rather than the debt financing primarily used by the company for previous acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to the company on acceptable terms 
acquisitions during  the company made four staffing acquisitions including five offices and approximately million in revenues for the twelve months preceding each acquisition annual historical revenue 
during  the company made five staffing acquisitions including offices and approximately million in annual historical revenue 
during  the company made eight staffing acquisitions including offices and approximately million in annual historical revenue 
during  the company made staffing acquisitions including offices and approximately million in annual historical revenue 
these acquisitions have resulted in a significant increase in goodwill and other intangible assets and correspondingly have resulted and will continue to result in increased amortization expense 
in addition  the amount of these intangible assets as a percentage of the company s total assets and shareholders equity has increased significantly and while the net unamortized balance of intangible assets as of december  is not considered to be impaired  any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
seasonality the company s quarterly results of operations reflect the seasonality of higher customer demand for industrial staffing services in the last two quarters of the year  as compared to the first two quarters 
in  the seasonal increase in industrial staffing revenue was lower than that experienced in prior years  which the company attributes to slower economic activity in us manufacturing and distribution 
even though there is a seasonal reduction of industrial staffing revenues in the first quarter of a year as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year  the company does not reduce the related core personnel and other operating expenses proportionally because most of that infrastructure is needed to support anticipated increased revenues in subsequent quarters 
peo revenues are generally not subject to seasonality to the same degree as industrial staffing revenues although the net income contribution of peo revenues expressed as a percentage of sales is significantly lower than the net income contribution of industrial staffing revenues 
as a result of the above factors  the company historically experiences operating income in the first quarter of a year that is significantly less than i the fourth quarter of the preceding year and ii the subsequent three quarters of the same year 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operations were not significant during the periods presented in the financial statements 
throughout the periods discussed above  the increases in revenues have resulted primarily from higher volumes  rather than price increases 
new accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
sfas no 
defines derivatives and establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   and cannot be applied retroactively 
the company intends to first implement sfas no 
in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended march   although it has not determined the effects  if any  that implementation will have 
however  sfas no 
could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
year issue as many computer systems  software programs and other equipment with embedded chips or processors collectively  information systems use only two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  they may be unable to process accurately certain data  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
the yk issue concerns not only information systems used solely within a company but also concerns third parties  such as customers  vendors and creditors  using information systems that may interact with or affect a company s operations 
the yk issue can affect the company s flexible staffing and peo operations  including  but not limited to  payroll processing  cash and invoicing transactions  and financial reporting and wire transfers from and to the company s banking institutions 
in  the company initiated a conversion of the primary software being used in its flexible staffing and peo operations  as well as its corporate wide accounting and billing software 
although this conversion was undertaken for the primary purpose of achieving a common data structure for all significant company applications as well as enhancing processing capacity and efficiency  the company believes that it also will result in software that properly interprets dates beyond the year year compliant 
the company s state of readiness the company has implemented a yk readiness program with the objective of having all of the company s significant information systems functioning properly with respect to yk before january  the first component of the company s readiness program was to identify the internal information systems of the company that are susceptible to system failures or processing errors as a result of the yk issue 
this effort is substantially complete 
all operating divisions have identified the information systems that may require remediation or replacement and have established priorities for repair or replacement 
those information systems considered most critical to continuing operations have been given the highest priority 
the second component of the yk readiness program involves the actual remediation and replacement of information systems 
the company is using both internal and external resources to complete this process 
information systems ranked highest in priority  such as the corporate accounting and billing software  have either been remediated or replaced or scheduled for remediation or replacement 
the remediation and replacement of internal information systems is substantially complete  with the final testing and certification for yk readiness anticipated by june this does not include the information systems utilized in franchise locations  which the company anticipates will be year compliant no later than september  as to the third component of the yk readiness program  the company has identified its significant customers  vendors and creditors that are believed  at this time  to be critical to business operations subsequent to january   and steps are underway to reasonably ascertain their respective stages of yk readiness through the use of questionnaires  interviews  on site visits and other available means 
the company will take appropriate action based on those responses  but there can be no assurance that the information systems provided by or utilized by other companies which affect the company s operations will be timely converted in such a way as to allow them to continue normal business operations or furnish products  services or data to the company without disruption 
risks if needed remediations and conversions to the information systems are not made on a timely basis by the company or its materially significant customers or vendors  the company could be affected by business disruption  operational problems  financial loss  legal liability to third parties and similar risks  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  liquidity or financial condition 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario in the event the company or its key customers or vendors fail to resolve the yk issue would be an inability on the part of the company to perform its core functions of payroll administration  tax reporting  unemployment and insurance claims filings  billing and collections  and health benefits administration 
factors which could cause material differences in results  many of which are outside the control of the company  include  but are not limited to  the company s ability to identify and correct all relevant computer software  the accuracy of representations by manufacturers of the company s information systems that their products are yk compliant  the ability of the company s customers and vendors to identify and resolve their own yk issues and the company s ability to respond to unforeseen yk complications 
contingency plans while the company continues to focus on solutions for yk issues  and expects to be yk compliant in a timely manner  the company  concurrently with the yk readiness measures described above  has established a yk project team whose mission is to develop contingency plans intended to mitigate the possible disruption in business operations that may result from the yk issue 
the company s yk project team  consisting of personnel from management  information systems technology and legal areas  is in the process of developing such plans and the cost estimates to implement them 
contingency plans may include purchasing or developing alternative software programs  the purchase of computer hardware and peripheral equipment  and other appropriate measures 
once developed  contingency plans and related cost estimates will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
the yk project team expects to conclude the development of these contingency plans by june  yk costs the company s management estimates that the total cost to the company of its yk compliance activities will not exceed  which is not considered material to the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the costs and time necessary to complete the yk modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors  however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from the estimates 
the company has capitalized and will continue to capitalize the costs of purchasing and developing new yk compliant information systems  but will expense the costs of the modifications to existing software made solely for purposes of yk compliance 
most of the cost of purchasing or modifying software in this regard had been incurred as of december  any remaining capitalized balance for information systems no longer utilized because of replacement by yk compliant information systems will be expensed at the time such hardware and software is replaced 
the company s yk readiness program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various components of the yk readiness program described above are subject to change

such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and are also based upon assumptions of future events  which may not prove to be accurate 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these known and unknown risks and uncertainties  include  but are not limited to changes in us economic conditions  particularly in the manufacturing sector  the company s dependence on regulatory approvals  its future cash flows  sales  gross margins and operating costs  the effect of changing market and other conditions in the staffing industry  the ability of the company to continue to grow  legal proceedings  including those related to the actions of the company s temporary or leased employees  the availability and cost of credit  the ability to maintain existing banking relationships  the company s ability to raise capital in the public equity markets  the availability of capital for additional acquisitions and the company s ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates and to successfully negotiate and complete those acquisitions on favorable terms  the ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions into the company s operations  the recoverability of the recorded value of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from past and future acquisitions  the general level of economic activity and unemployment in the company s markets  specifically within the construction  manufacturing  distribution and other light industrial trades  increased price competition  changes in government regulations or interpretations thereof  particularly those related to employment  the continued availability of qualified temporary personnel  the financial condition of the company s clients and their demand for the company s services which in turn may be affected by the effects of  and changes in  us and worldwide economic conditions  collection of accounts receivable  the company s ability to retain large clients  the company s ability to recruit  motivate and retain key management personnel  the costs of complying with government regulations including occupational safety and health provisions  wage and hour and minimum wage laws and workers compensation and unemployment insurance laws and the ability of the company to increase fees charged to its clients to offset increased costs relating to these laws and regulations  volatility in the workers compensation  liability and other insurance markets  inclement weather  interruption  impairment or loss of data integrity or malfunction of information processing systems  changes in government regulations or interpretations thereof  particularly those related to peos  including the possible adoption by the irs of an unfavorable position as to the tax qualified status of employee benefit plans maintained by peos  and other risks detailed from time to time by the company or in its press releases or in its filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  the market price of the company s stock may from time to time be significantly volatile as a result of  among other things  the company s operating results  the operating results of other temporary staffing and peo companies  economic conditions  the proportion of the company s stock available for active trading and the performance of the stock market in general 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors 
further  management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by cautionary statements in this paragraph and elsewhere in this form k  and in other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  including  but not limited to the company s registration statement on form s file no 
 including the risk factors section thereof  filed with the securities and exchange commission on december   and declared effective on january  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of borrowing associated with its operating and investing activities  is exposed to changes in interest rates that may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
to fund most of its working capital needs  the company utilizes proceeds from the sale of its accounts receivable to a third party  who in turn uses the receivables to secure us dollar denominated short term commercial paper 
the company s cost for this funding is based on the interest paid by the third party on the outstanding commercial paper 
long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
of the million of long term borrowings on the company s balance sheet as of december   approximately represented fixed rate instruments 
of the million arrived at by adding the outstanding commercial paper not on the company s balance sheet as of december  to the million of borrowings on the company s balance sheet at that date  approximately represented fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with its borrowing activities  the company has entered into a derivative financial instrument transaction to maintain the desired level of exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations and to minimize interest expense see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the company s financial instrument counterparty is a high quality commercial bank with significant experience with such instruments 
the company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards 
the maximum credit exposure at december  was not significant to the company 
a hypothetical about basis points adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase the company s interest expense by approximately million and decrease net income after taxes by approximately million  or per diluted share 
this includes the mitigating effects  if any  of the derivative financial instrument transaction entered into by the company and assumes that the company s financing requirements in would approximate the actual outstanding debt and commercial paper balances as of december  the above discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analyses referred to above include forward looking statements of market risk which assume for analytical purposes that certain adverse market conditions may occur 
actual future market conditions may differ materially from such assumptions because the amounts noted previously are the result of analyses used for the purpose of assessing possible risks and the mitigation thereof 
the sec disclosures on market risk require that all financial instruments  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  should be included in the quantitative disclosure calculation 
operating leases are not required to be disclosed by sfas no  and have not been included as part of the above analysis 
this is a significant limitation to the analysis presented 
as a result  the overall impact to the company s operating results from a hypothetical change in interest rates may be overstated 
there are certain other shortcomings inherent to the analyses presented 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  changes are rarely instantaneous 
although certain liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in actual sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also ignored 
accordingly  the forward looking statements should not be considered projections by the company of future events or losses and are subject to the factors discussed under the caption forward looking statements certain cautionary statements of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
