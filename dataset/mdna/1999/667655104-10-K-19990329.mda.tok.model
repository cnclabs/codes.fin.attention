item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the consolidated financial statements include regulated utility northwest natural gas company nw natural non regulated subsidiary businesses nng financial corporation financial corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary canor energy  ltd 
canor  a majority owned subsidiary oregon natural gas development corporation oregon natural merged with and into nw natural during the second quarter of together these businesses are referred to herein as the company see subsidiary operations below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is management s assessment of the company s financial condition including the principal factors that affect results of operations

earnings and dividends the company s earnings applicable to common stock in were million  down from million in and million in earnings for were reduced by write downs of subsidiary assets 
earnings for and were the highest and second highest on record for the company 
earnings for both and were reduced by warmer than normal weather  the effect of which was partially offset by additional sales from customer growth 
earnings reflected both colder weather and customer growth 
diluted earnings per share from consolidated operations were a share in  down from a share in and a share in nw natural earned a share from gas utility operations in  compared to in and in weather conditions in its service territory in were percent warmer than in and percent warmer than the year average 
weather in was percent warmer than and percent warmer than the year average 
the estimated weather related decrease in net operating revenues margin during was equivalent to about cents a share compared to actual conditions during the weather related decrease in margin in was equivalent to about cents a share as compared to actual conditions in customer growth of percent during contributed an estimated million to margin 
customer growth of percent during both and contributed an estimated million to margin and million to margin 
earnings in from nw natural s non utility operations other than the subsidiaries included cents a share due to a transaction involving canor see subsidiary operations and other income expense  below 
subsidiary results for were equivalent to a loss of cents a share  compared to earnings of cents a share in and cents in the loss in includes write downs of subsidiary assets totaling million  equivalent to cents a share 
results included a million gain from the sale of an interest in a california solar electric partnership 
the decrease in from was primarily due to a one time gain in of million from the sale of underground storage assets to nw natural  offset by a million impairment loss on producing wells and a million write down of unproven properties 
was the rd consecutive year in which the company s dividends paid have increased 
dividends paid on common stock were a share in compared to in and in results of operations regulatory matters nw natural provides gas utility service in oregon and washington  with oregon representing approximately percent of its revenues 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined for the most part by the pace of continued growth in the residential and commercial markets  by nw natural s ability to remain price competitive in the large industrial market  by its ability to control expenses  and by its ability to obtain timely regulatory ratemaking treatment for investments made in utility plant 
nw natural currently has no competition from other gas utility distributors in the territory it serves 
however  it competes with williams northwest pipeline wnp  formerly northwest pipeline corporation  to serve large industrial customers  with oil and electricity for industrial and commercial uses  and with oil  electricity  and wood for residential use 
the pacific northwest has historically enjoyed some of the lowest electric rates in the nation  primarily due to the proximity of federal hydropower facilities 
with further deregulation in the energy business  the market for energy will become more competitive  but the northwest is unlikely to experience the large drop in electric rates that other  high cost areas of the country are anticipating 
in  nw natural maintained its competitive advantage over electricity and approximate price parity with fuel oil in the residential and commercial markets 
the opuc approved rate increases averaging percent  percent and percent effective  respectively  dec 
 apr 
and jan 
  and rate decreases averaging percent effective dec 
 these rate changes reflected changes in nw natural s purchased gas costs  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize regulatory balancing accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective the previous year 
the wutc approved rate increases averaging percent and percent effective dec 
 and  respectively  and rate decreases averaging percent effective dec 
 these rate changes primarily reflected changes in nw natural s purchased gas costs 
in october  the wutc approved a general rate increase averaging percent for nw natural s customers in washington and authorized a rate of return on common equity of percent 
none of the rate increases and decreases discussed above had a material effect on net income 
in october  nw natural filed its first general rate case in oregon since the filing proposes a revenue increase of million per year from oregon operations through rate increases averaging percent 
the proposed increase is designed to cover the costs of the additional gas storage at mist  nw natural s new customer information system cis  and the year project 
in november  the opuc suspended the proposed rate increase for investigation and hearings 
comparison of gas operations the following table summarizes the composition of gas utility volumes and revenues for the three years ended december thousands except customers and degree days gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales   unbilled volumes   weather sensitive volumes   industrial firm sales   industrial interruptible sales   total gas sales   transportation deliveries   total volumes sold and delivered   utility operating revenues residential and commercial revenues   unbilled revenues   weather sensitive revenues   industrial firm sales revenues   industrial interruptible sales revenues   total gas sales revenues   transportation revenues   other revenues   total utility operating revenues   cost of gas sold   total number of customers end of period   actual degree days   year average degree days   thousands except customers and degree days gas sales and transportation volumes therms residential and commercial sales  unbilled volumes  weather sensitive volumes  industrial firm sales  industrial interruptible sales  total gas sales  transportation deliveries  total volumes sold and delivered  utility operating revenues residential and commercial revenues  unbilled revenues  weather sensitive revenues  industrial firm sales revenues  industrial interruptible sales revenues  total gas sales revenues  transportation revenues  other revenues  total utility operating revenues  cost of gas sold  total number of customers end of period  actual degree days  year average degree days  residential and commercial customer growth continues at a rapid rate relative to others in the industry 
the  customers added since dec 
 represent a growth rate of percent  compared to the record growth rate of percent in both and in the three years ended dec 
  more than  customers were added to the system  representing an average annual growth rate of percent 
typically  percent or more of nw natural s annual operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
accordingly  variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to and revenues derived from these customers 
weather conditions were percent warmer than average in  percent warmer than average in  and percent colder than average in average weather conditions are calculated from the most recent years of temperature data measured by heating degree days 
weather in was percent warmer than in and was percent warmer than the volumes of gas sold to residential and commercial customers during increased percent as compared to  reflecting continued customer growth offset by warmer weather 
related revenues increased percent due to increased volumes and the rate increases effective in late and revenue from residential and commercial customers was down percent in as compared to primarily due to the rate decreases effective dec 
 in order to match revenues with related purchased gas costs  nw natural records unbilled revenues for gas delivered but not yet billed to customers through the end of the period 
industrial sales  transportation and other revenues total volumes of gas delivered to industrial customers were percent higher in than in and percent higher in than in however  the combined margin from industrial sales and transportation decreased by percent in from and by percent in from the decrease in industrial margin despite increased volumes in both and reflects the effect of low oil prices on an industrial schedule in which rates vary with oil prices  and transfers of some industrial customers to rate schedules or special contracts with lower margins 
in addition  nw natural lost one large industrial customer to a bypass of its system in after experiencing no losses due to bypass in either or although nw natural does not expect a significant number of its large customers to bypass its system in the foreseeable future  it may experience further deterioration of margin associated with customers transfers to contracts with pricing designed to be competitive with the capital and operating costs of direct connections to wnp s system 
other revenues are primarily related to adjustments in regulatory accounts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  other revenues included the deferral of million in revenue reductions required under a settlement approved by the opuc as part of the jan 
 rate changes  offset by million from the amortization of property tax savings and million from amortizations of other regulatory accounts 
in  other revenues included million from the amortization of property tax savings and million from the amortization of oregon income tax savings 
in  other revenues included million from the amortization of property tax savings  million from regulatory amortizations  and non recurring gains totaling million from the resolution of two regulatory issues before the opuc 
cost of gas nw natural s cost per therm of gas sold was percent higher in than in  primarily due to higher prevailing prices in the natural gas commodity market 
its cost of gas sold was percent lower in than in the cost per therm of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage  demand cost equalization  regulatory deferrals and company use 
the cost of gas sold was reduced by off system gas sales of million in compared to million in and million in under an agreement with the opuc  revenues from these sales are treated as a reduction of gas costs 
nw natural has a purchased gas cost adjustment pga tariff under which its net income from oregon operations is affected only within defined limits by changes in purchased gas costs 
effective jan 
  the incentive formula for deferred gas costs under its pga tariff in oregon was modified so that nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
the remaining percent of the higher or lower gas costs are recorded as deferred debits or credits regulatory assets or liabilities for recovery from or refund to customers in future rates 
in and  nw natural absorbed percent of its higher cost of gas sold  while the remaining percent of higher gas costs was recorded as deferred debits 
subsidiary operations consolidated results for the subsidiaries in were losses of million  equivalent to cents a share  compared to earnings of million  or cents a share  in and million  or cents a share  in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
subsidiary results in included asset write downs totaling million  equivalent to cents a share for nw natural 
operating results without the asset write downs were a loss of million  equivalent to cents a share 
financial corporation recorded asset impairment charges in totaling million  equivalent to cents a share 
the charges resulted from the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  to financial corporation s limited partnership investments in solar electric  wind power electric and hydroelectric generation projects in california 
the determinations of impairments for financial corporation s assets resulted from lower estimates of prices for future sales of electricity from the partnerships power projects 
financial corporation s operating results in were net income of million  compared to million in and million in the declines in financial corporation s ongoing operations from to and from to were primarily due to weaker operating results from its investments in the limited partnerships 
its results included a million gain from the sale of an interest in a solar electric partnership 
nw natural s share of canor s results for was a loss of million  compared to income of million in and million in results for included asset write downs totaling million  equivalent to cents a share for nw natural 
approximately half of the write downs were asset impairment charges due to the application of sfas no 
 resulting from the impact of low oil prices on canor s oil properties in alberta 
the other write downs were due to determinations that some oil and gas wells were no longer productive because of water encroachment 
canor s results included a million write down of unproven properties  while its results included million in asset impairment charges under sfas no 
in march  canor purchased the stock of southlake energy  inc southlake  an indirect subsidiary of nipsco industries  inc 
ni 
canor was then amalgamated with southlake 
the resulting company is owned percent by nw natural and percent by ni canada ulc  another indirect subsidiary of ni 
for financial reporting purposes  canor s operating revenues and expenses are included in full in the company s statement of income 
the percent portion of canor s results applicable to the minority interest is included in other income expense as a reduction in the case of earnings  or as an increase in the case of losses 
oregon natural earned million in  including a one time gain of million from the sale of underground storage assets to nw natural 
the gain was partially offset by charges totaling million for asset impairments and write downs of unproven properties 
oregon natural was merged into nw natural during  thereby effecting the transfer of certain assets  including the stock of canor  to nw natural 
the company s investments in its subsidiaries at dec 
 were million for canor and million for financial corporation  compared to million for canor and million for financial corporation at dec 
 the increase in the company s investment in canor includes million converted to equity from inter company debt at the time of canor s amalgamation with southlake 
operating expenses operations and maintenance consolidated operations and maintenance expenses were million  or percent  higher in than in nw natural s operations and maintenance expenses increased million  or percent  compared to due to higher accruals for uncollectible accounts million  maintenance expenses for a new customer information system cis million  amortizations of year costs million  higher market development expenses million  and employee severance charges million 
subsidiary expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to due to the inclusion in this category of all of the expenses for canor following the canor southlake amalgamation 
operations and maintenance expenses in were million lower than in primarily due to a one time charge of million in for litigation see chase gardens litigation  below  offset by increases in customer service and market development expense million  electronic and network services million  and environmental investigation and remediation charges million 
subsidiary expenses decreased million  or percent  in compared to primarily due to a decline in oregon natural s production costs 
chase gardens litigation in july  a jury in an oregon state court returned a verdict against nw natural in the case of northwest natural gas company v 
chase gardens  inc lane county circuit court case no 

the oregon court of appeals oregon court of appeals case no 
ca a affirmed the trial court decision in february nw natural filed a petition for review of the court of appeals decision by the oregon supreme court 
in august  the oregon supreme court agreed to hear the case on appeal and is expected to render a final ruling during nw natural recorded a charge of million in  equivalent to cents a share  as a reserve against payment of the judgment  related costs and post judgment interest 
taxes other than income taxes other than income  which are comprised of property  franchise  payroll and other taxes  increased million  or percent  in property tax expense was million  or percent higher than in  due to more plant in service 
franchise taxes  which are based on gross revenues  increased million  reflecting higher revenues due to rate increases effective jan 
 apr 
and dec 
 taxes other than income declined million  or percent  in nw natural s property taxes decreased million  or percent due to settlements reached in relating to property valuations and regulatory treatment of reduced property taxes 
franchise taxes decreased million  or percent  paralleling the percentage decrease in gas sales revenues from to the decrease in franchise taxes was offset by an increase in payroll taxes and regulatory fees 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or percent  in compared to  and million  or percent  in compared to nw natural s depreciation expense increased by million from to due to an additional million of utility plant placed in service 
the new cis  placed in service in the fourth quarter of  increased depreciation expense by million compared to nw natural s depreciation expense increased by million in compared to  primarily due to an additional million of utility plant placed in service in depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense for the subsidiaries increased million in canor s depreciation expense increased million due in part to an increase in total assets after the canor southlake amalgamation 
depreciation expenses for canor also included million for asset write downs see subsidiary operations  above 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the subsidiaries decreased million in compared to depreciation expense for included charges of million recorded by canor for the write down of unproven properties and abandonment of dry wells 
other income expense the variations in other income expense during the past three years resulted primarily from non recurring items 
in  nw natural recorded as other income a million gain  equivalent to cents a share  from the amalgamation of canor with southlake 
the resulting gain was not subject to us income tax 
other income expense for also includes the million in asset write downs recorded by financial corporation under sfas no 
see subsidiary operations  above 
in  oregon natural recorded a million gain on the sale of its underground storage facilities to nw natural 
other income now includes interest income on deferred regulatory accounts  other income for prior years has been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
prior to jan 
  interest accrued on deferred regulatory accounts was included in miscellaneous operating income or was treated as an adjustment to the cost of gas 
interest charges interest charges increased million  or percent  in compared to due to a million increase in long term debt and an increase in nw natural s average balance of commercial paper outstanding from million in to million in the increases in commercial paper and long term debt balances were due to increased gas costs  construction spending to fund customer growth and other spending for general corporate purposes 
interest charges in increased million  or percent  compared to the increase also resulted from higher long term and short term debt balances due to the financing of nw natural s million utility construction program and million in deferred gas costs 
allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of funds used during the construction of utility plant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  afudc reduced interest expense by million compared to million in and million in the weighted average afudc rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in see financing activities  below 
income taxes the effective corporate income tax rates for  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the lower rate in was due primarily to the non taxable gain from canor s amalgamation with southlake see subsidiary operations  and other income expense  above  and in part to permanent tax savings resulting from a change in book depreciation rates and increased tax credits 
the effective tax rate in was lower than the statutory rate due to permanent tax savings from the change in book depreciation rates  an increase in tax credits and a reversal of amounts previously recorded for the california solar energy investment sold see note to the consolidated financial statements 
redeemable preferred and preference stock dividend requirements redeemable preferred and preference stock dividend requirements for were lower by million  or percent  compared to  due to sinking fund redemptions 
the requirements were lower by million  or percent  due to sinking fund redemptions and the redemption of the series of redeemable preferred stock 
financial condition capital structure nw natural s capital expenditures are primarily related to utility construction resulting from customer growth and system improvements 
nw natural finances these expenditures from cash provided by operations and from short term borrowings which are periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
in addition to its capital expenditures  the weather sensitive nature of gas usage by nw natural s residential and commercial customers influences the company s financing requirements 
short term liquidity is satisfied primarily through the sale of commercial paper  which is supported by commercial bank lines of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s long term goal is to maintain a capital structure comprised of to percent common stock equity  to percent preferred and preference stock and to percent short term and long term debt 
when additional capital is required  the company issues debt or equity securities depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
the company also uses these sources to meet long term debt and preferred and preference stock redemption requirements see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows operating activities operating activities provided net cash of million in compared to million in the percent increase was due to increased cash from operations million  offset in part by higher working capital requirements million 
the increase in cash from operations compared to was primarily due to lower deferred gas costs receivable million  an increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense million and non cash investment losses including the asset write downs by financial corporation million 
the increase in cash from operations was offset by lower net income million  a reduction in deferred taxes and investment tax credits million and a gain on sale of assets million 
the increase in working capital requirements was due to increases in accounts receivable million and accrued unbilled revenue million which were offset by a reduction in accounts payable million and other current assets and liabilities million 
cash provided by operating activities in was million  percent lower than in the decrease was primarily due to an increase in deferred gas costs million and a decrease in accounts payable million 
the company has lease and purchase commitments relating to its operating activities which are financed with cash flows from operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investing activities cash used in investing activities declined million  from million in to million in nw natural s capital expenditures totaled million  down million  or percent  from the decrease in cash requirements for utility construction resulted from completion of the new cis million  a gas storage expansion project mist storage ii million and several special projects million  lower replacement and reinforcement expenditures million  a land purchase for a new service center in million  reduced expenditures for computer hardware and software million  and lower construction overhead million 
cash requirements for nw natural s capital program in totaled million  up million  or percent  from the increase included expenditures for mist storage ii million  completion of the new cis million  transportation equipment million  expansion and reinforcement of the gas distribution system to accommodate customer growth million  land purchases for the new service center million  and the upgrading of other computer system hardware and software million 
nw natural s construction expenditures are estimated at million for over the five year period through  these expenditures are estimated at between million and million 
the high level of capital expenditures over the next five years reflects projected high customer growth plus a major system reinforcement project and the development of additional underground storage facilities 
an estimated percent of the required funds is expected to be internally generated  with the remainder to be funded through a combination of long term debt and equity securities with short term debt providing liquidity and bridge financing 
in  non utility capital expenditures totaled million 
canor invested million in canadian exploration and production properties 
nw natural s non utility expenditures totaling million included expenditures relating to a contract for the construction of a new headquarters building for the port of portland on land currently owned by nw natural million and additions to existing facilities million

cash provided by financing activities in totaled million  compared to cash used for financing of million in the primary financing activities in which accounted for the change from were nw natural s sale of million of its medium term notes and the net issuance of million of commercial paper  partially offset by the redemption of million of medium term notes and first mortgage bonds 
ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended dec 
  and  the company s ratios of earnings to fixed charges  computed using the securities and exchange commission method  were  and  respectively 
for this purpose  earnings consist of net income before taxes plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness  the amortization of debt expense and discount or premium  and the estimated interest portion of rentals charged to income 
contingent liabilities year readiness overview the company has identified and is in the process of correcting the information technology it and non it systems within its control that could be affected by the year issue 
in early  nw natural established a year project office with technical specialists experienced in the year issue  sponsored by two senior executives 
the company s objective in its year project is to reduce the risk of business disruption or serious financial loss due to it and non it systems failures relating to the year issue 
in november  nw natural replaced its largest application  its customer information system for residential and small commercial customers incorporating billing  customer order  credit and other programs  with a fully year ready system 
additional project work includes maintaining and managing the inventory of its date sensitive it and non it systems  researching and managing the degree of year readiness of it and non it systems of the suppliers and vendors with whom it has material relationships  identifying and assessing the cost of renovating or replacing non it systems within its control that could be affected by the year issue  assigning risk ratings to its it and non it systems in order to prioritize renovation and replacement efforts  and developing contingency plans for high risk systems or vendor products where products are known to be non compliant or readiness levels cannot be independently verified 
readiness of systems the year project office has achieved various stages of correction for impacted it systems and non it equipment and  overall  nw natural has maintained and expects to continue its planned schedule for correction 
nw natural plans to complete renovations of its internal applications with the highest risk ratings by jun 
  and to evaluate and develop appropriate plans to renovate or address risks of failure in its remaining lower risk systems by the end of among applications originally identified for internal renovation  percent had been completed through construction  testing and implementation as of dec 
 eighty eight percent of the high priority applications either were complete or had been identified for replacement or retirement 
nw natural has been developing a new billing system for industrial and large commercial i c customers to replace an existing system that is not year compliant 
the development project for the new i c system is on schedule  but the company has implemented a contingency plan by reviewing coding designs  staffing availability and cost estimates for the renovation of the existing system so that it could be ready by year end 
this effort may be terminated at any time if it appears that the i c replacement project is reaching its key milestones on schedule for completion by october suppliers and vendors nw natural is evaluating the status of year compliance efforts of critical suppliers and vendors 
these contacts include written communication or face to face meetings with providers of interstate capacity and storage  natural gas suppliers  financial institutions and electric and telephone companies 
in addition  the project office is currently investigating vendor supplied products 
of these products  products either have been determined to be compliant  or have been represented by the vendors to be compliant if used in connection with other compliant systems 
another products were deemed non compliant and products are under active investigation 
if warranted  the company will identify alternative vendor sources to the extent alternatives are available  and develop contingency plans for any critical vendor products considered at risk where alternatives are not available 
risks and contingency planning the company has not quantified its worst case exposure from the year issue  but the project office intends to make such estimates while prioritizing the highest risk systems for correction 
with respect to its internal operations  nw natural believes its most significant risks are its ability to render timely bills to its industrial and large commercial customers  its ability to use electronic devices to control and operate its distribution system and its ability to maintain continuous operation of its computer systems 
in the event that any year related problems may occur  the company intends to implement contingency plans to mitigate the impact of such failures to the extent possible 
these plans will include options for manual control and operation of the gas distribution system 
with respect to external factors  nw natural relies on the suppliers of natural gas and interstate transportation to deliver natural gas to the company s distribution system 
external infrastructure such as electric and telephone service is necessary for the company s basic operation as well as the operations of many of its customers 
a failure by any of these critical vendors could challenge the company s ability to meet the demands of its customers 
as part of its normal business practice  however  nw natural maintains plans to follow during emergency circumstances 
these plans are incorporated into its contingency plan for potential year related problems 
financial impact nw natural s total estimated cost for its year readiness program is million 
this amount includes its costs of assessment  planning  vendor management  project management and other project costs as well as the costs of renovating and testing internal applications 
nw natural s costs in and for year activities totaled million 
neither the total estimated cost nor the costs to date include the costs incurred in replacing nw natural s customer information system or costs for other it systems that are being replaced rather than renovated 
in accordance with an order of the opuc  nw natural s incremental operating costs for year readiness are being deferred and amortized over a five year period 
disclaimer as a result of its year program and the replacement of the residential and small commercial customer information system  the company does not believe that  in the aggregate  year issues will be material to its business  operations or financial condition 
however  despite the company s efforts  there can be no assurance that all material year risks relating to systems within its control will have been adequately identified and corrected before the end of in addition  while the company is in the process of researching the year readiness of its suppliers and vendors  the company can make no assurances regarding the year compliance status of systems or parties outside its control  and currently cannot assess the effect on it of any non compliance by such systems or parties 
the year statements in this report are year readiness disclosures under the year information and readiness disclosure act and are made to the best knowledge and belief of the company 
environmental matters nw natural owns property in linnton  oregon  that is the site of a former gas manufacturing plant that was closed in in  pursuant to oregon department of environmental quality odeq procedures  nw natural submitted a notice of intent to participate in the odeq s voluntary cleanup program and  in  the site was listed on odeq s confirmed release list and inventory 
during  initial tests revealed environmental contamination  but the extent or the estimated cost of remediation cannot yet be determined 
during  the odeq and the us environmental protection agency epa completed a study of sediments in a mile segment of the willamette river that includes the area adjacent to the site 
remediation of the site may be affected by the sediments management plan now being developed in response to the odeq epa sediments study 
since  nw natural has recorded expenses of million for the estimated costs of consultants fees  odeq oversight cost reimbursements and voluntary investigation  plus an estimate for costs of the continuing investigation 
nw natural expects that its costs of investigation and any remediation for which it may be responsible should be recoverable  in large part  from insurance 
in the event these costs are not recovered from insurance  nw natural will seek recovery through future rates 
nw natural also is monitoring an environmental investigation of a site in eugene  oregon see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposures associated with activities involving derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments are natural gas commodity price risk  foreign currency risk and interest rate risk 
nw natural uses derivative financial instruments as tools to mitigate certain of these market risks 
nw natural enters into such instruments for hedging purposes  not for trading purposes 
market risks associated with the derivative financial instruments are monitored by management personnel who do not directly enter into these contracts and by a committee of the board of directors 
canor also enters into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging price risks associated with contractual gas purchase and sales commitments and natural gas production 
unrealized changes in the market value of these derivatives are recognized upon settlement along with the underlying hedged transactions 
physical and financial commodity and foreign currency transactions nw natural enters into short term and long term natural gas purchase contracts with demand and commodity fixed price and variable price components  along with associated short term and long term natural gas transportation contracts 
many of the purchases made under these contracts are in canadian dollars and nw natural uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
nw natural historically has taken physical delivery of at least the minimum quantities specified in its natural gas purchase contracts 
many commodity purchase contracts provide for net settlement based on the difference between contract price and comparable market value should the contract minimum quantities not be delivered 
changes in the market value of these contracts are not recorded 
rather  actual costs are recorded when the contracted delivery is received 
nw natural s pga mechanism in oregon provides for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs in comparison with established benchmark costs  except that nw natural absorbs percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retains percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to projections 
the physical delivery gas purchase contracts are subject to annual re pricing  a process that is intended to reflect anticipated market price trends during the next year 
nw natural has generally been able to obtain competitive prices for these purchases and in turn has provided competitive prices for sales to its customers 
market risk is typically managed on a contract by contract basis  subject to parameters established by the board of directors 
nw natural has established risk management processes  policies and procedures to monitor and control these market risks  including an objective that there be a balance between contracted minimum purchase quantities and expected demand 
because nw natural considers all of the derivative financial instruments it uses to be hedges  it does not measure market risk on a daily basis 
the only determination of market position for these contracts is mark to market 
management does not believe market valuation of the physical contracts would be warranted because the company intends to take physical delivery of the commodity and the contracts are subject to annual re pricing 
at dec 
  differences between notional values and fair values with respect to nw natural s open positions in derivative financial instruments were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  to the degree that market risks exist due to potential adverse changes in commodity prices and foreign exchange rates in relation to these financial and physical contracts  the company considers the risks to be commodity price risk the prices of natural gas commodity are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
the following table summarizes information with respect to transactions that are sensitive to commodity price risk 
nw natural uses natural gas commodity swap agreements to convert certain long term gas purchase contracts from floating prices to fixed prices 
as of dec 
  the company had not entered into any natural gas commodity swaps or other derivative commodity instruments extending beyond the end of in the table  the notional quantity is the total volume of natural gas covered by these derivative commodity instruments  and the notional value of the gas is the sum of the notional quantities covered by each instrument times the respective strike pay price
