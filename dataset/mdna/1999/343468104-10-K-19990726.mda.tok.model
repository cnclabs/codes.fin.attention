item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company provides ultrahigh pressure uhp waterjets and related products and services to a wide variety of industries 
waterjet cutting is recognized as a better alternative to traditional cutting methods such as saws  plasma or laser systems 
it is faster  has greater versatility in the types of products it can cut and eliminates the need for secondary processing operations 
the company divides its uhp revenues into two primary categories of product  uhp waterjet systems and uhp consumable parts and services 
consolidated revenues by major product categories in thousands revenue revenue revenue uhp waterjet systems    uhp consumable parts and services    total uhp revenues    in addition to uhp revenue  the company s fiscal and consolidated revenues also include the non core access and services operations that were sold in september these operations included spider staging corporation  power climber and affiliated companies  the ark systems division  consortium europeen du materiel  the hydromilling registered trademark division and rampart waterblast  inc

the following pro forma table separates the company s fiscal consolidated income statement into the ongoing operations uhp and the divested operations access and services 
the access and services results include an associated million restructuring charge 
this charge is included as a separate component of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

the company s revenues can be segregated into two primary categories  systems sales and consumables sales 
systems are generally comprised of a pump along with the robotics or articulation used to move the cutting or cleaning head 
systems are further broken down between standard systems such as the bengal registered trademark  integrated flying bridge and a series  and special or custom designed systems used primarily in the aerospace and automotive markets 
systems sales in fiscal were million  a decrease of  over the prior year 
included in this decrease was an million reduction in large custom designed systems versus the prior year 
weakness in the automotive and aerospace markets account for this decrease 
in addition  the average standard domestic system selling price has decreased by as the lower cost systems  such as the integrated flying bridge and bengal  now deliver improved accuracy and feature enhancements that were formerly found only on the more expensive models 
consumables are primarily parts used by the pump and cutting head during operation 
consumable parts and services revenues increased million to million in fiscal the consumable parts increase reflects the expanding base of waterjet systems installed throughout the world 
domestically  revenues increased to million and represent of fiscal sales 
this increase in revenues was achieved in spite of a decrease in the us cutting machine tool market for the months ended april  according to the association for manufacturing technology amt 
the company did however experience weakness domestically during the fourth quarter of fiscal with an decline in domestic sales as compared to the prior year 
according to amt  the domestic cutting machine tool market dropped during the first calendar quarter of management believes the decline in fourth quarter domestic sales is a function of a tightening economy as opposed to a reduction in the benefits of the waterjet cutting technology over competitive technologies 
european revenues posted the strongest geographic gain  to million and represent of total revenues 
the company experienced weakness in the asian region  where revenues decreased million to million 
weakness in japan accounted for million of this drop 
sales in the remainder of the world  primarily canada  mexico and south america also decreased to million 
the company typically sells its products at higher prices outside the united states due to the costs of servicing these markets 
the company did not significantly raise prices during fiscal the company has begun to apply uhp technology to food  also known as fresher under pressure 
by exposing foods to pressures from  psi to over  psi for a short time  typically seconds to slightly more than two minutes  uhp achieves the effects of pasteurization without heat 
not only are spoilage microorganisms destroyed  but the process also destroys harmful pathogens such as e 
coli bacteria  thus increasing shelf life while ensuring a safe  healthy product 
unlike thermal treatment pasteurization  uhp technology does not destroy or alter the nutritional qualities  taste  texture or color of the food 
flow has developed a technology that features a continuous flow concept whereby pumpable foods such as juices  salsas  guacamole  liquid eggs and salad dressings are pumped into pressure chambers  pressurized and then pumped into the next stage of the process  such as bottling 
this continuous flow process is fully automated and requires just a single operator 
the company also has the ability to uhp process non pumpable foods as a result of the march acquisition of flow pressure systems vasteras ab pressure systems 
pressure systems provides flow the patented large batch system vessel technology 
flow is the leader in both the continuous feed and batch uhp food processing technology 
the company has delivered two continuous flow technology systems and is producing several other systems for near term delivery 
the company is leasing the continuous flow technology and  as such  the deliveries did not result in revenue recognition in fiscal these leases have a fixed monthly charge plus a per gallon or per pound usage fee 
the batch processing systems manufactured by pressure systems are sold  not leased 
the company estimates fiscal revenues related to both batch and continuous flow food purification systems will be between million and million depending on when clients launch their new fresh products 
management also anticipates this market will double each year for the next three years 
gross profit for the year ended april  increased million on just a increase in sales 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue gross margin rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in general  gross margin rates on systems sales are less than and on consumables sales are in excess of 
as such  the gross margin rate can vary depending on the revenue mix between systems  both standard and special  and consumables sales 
systems sales represented of fiscal revenues  down from in the prior year  and consumables sales represented of fiscal revenues  up from in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin rate was a function of the shift in revenue towards a greater percentage of consumables sales  as well as an increase in standard system sales  as compared to special systems 
on average  standard systems carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems 
additionally  production efficiencies and greater throughput resulted in reduced costs 
total operating expenses of million increased million over the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal marketing expense of million increased million as compared to the prior year  and expressed as a percentage of revenues  increased to from in the prior year 
this increase includes marketing activity for fresher under pressure and several major trade shows including imts and emo  both of which are held every other year 
research and engineering expense in fiscal increased million to million as compared to the prior year 
approximately million of this increase was development of the fresher under pressure technology 
management will continue to aggressively pursue technological advances through increased research and engineering spending to maintain the company s technological superiority 
as a percentage of revenues  research and engineering expenses were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal general administrative expense of million increased million for the year as compared to the prior year 
expressed as a percentage of revenues however  general and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year at 
operating income can vary significantly for domestic and foreign operations  but is primarily the result of product mix variations and volume from year to year 
management continues to monitor the economic situation throughout all primary geographic areas 
domestic growth was weaker than past years and the asian region experienced a decline 
management anticipates a continued weakness in the domestic economy for the near term and flat to slightly reduced sales into asia for fiscal fiscal european growth is expected to continue but at a lower level than in fiscal net interest expense of million increased  in fiscal compared to this increase resulted from higher debt levels associated with a million stock repurchase program and inventory and capital asset additions related to fresher under pressure of approximately million 
during fiscal  other expense  net  totaled  compared to other expense  net  of  in fiscal fiscal income tax expense was of income before tax as compared to in the previous year 
the income tax rates were lower than the statutory rates in both the current and prior year due primarily to lower foreign tax rates  benefits from the foreign sales corporation  and an ongoing review of the company s valuation allowance 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is  and  respectively  for fiscal and  and  respectively  for fiscal the company recorded fiscal net income of million  or 
basic and 
diluted earnings per share as compared to million  or 
basic and 
diluted earnings per share in fiscal the company s pretax investment in fresher under pressure in marketing  research and engineering and the carrying costs of inventory and fixed assets was million in fiscal excluding the effects of fresher under pressure spending  fiscal net income would have been million or

fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal the company sold its non core access and services operations 
fiscal results included these operations only during the first quarter  while fiscal included these operations for the entire year 
the access and services business units accounted for approximately and of fiscal and revenues  respectively 
the following pro forma table separates the company s consolidated income statement into the ongoing operations uhp and the divested operations access and services 
the company recorded a total of million in restructuring charges during fiscal and to write down the access and services assets sold to net realizable value and provide for transaction expenses and probable future obligations associated with the sale 
these charges are included as a separate component of operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income  and are included in the access and services results below in thousands year ended april  year ended april  access access uhp services consolidated uhp services consolidated revenue       gross profit       operating expenses       operating income loss       interest other exp  net     pretax income loss      given the disposition of access and services  two separate results of operations reviews have been provided 
the uhp results of operations analysis provides a review of the uhp operations for fiscal as compared to and the access and services operations analysis is a review of the results of operations for access and services for fiscal as compared to uhp results of operations analysis the following analysis is a year over year comparison of the ongoing uhp operations 
the following pro forma table presents the results of operations of the company s uhp business only in thousands year ended april  revenue   gross profit   operating expenses marketing   research and engineering   general and administrative   operating income   interest expense  net   other expense  net pretax income   net income   revenues for the year ended april  were million  an increase of million over the prior year period 
systems sales in fiscal were million  an increase of million over the prior year 
the company s standard systems  the flying bridge  the bengal and the a series  represent the majority of the increase in systems sales 
consumable parts and services revenues increased million to million in fiscal revenues grew in all three primary geographic markets  the americas  europe and asia  with increases of  and  respectively  over the prior year 
the company did not significantly raise prices during fiscal the gross margin rate was in both fiscal and the gross margin rate is dependent on the mix of sales between systems and consumables 
systems sales represented of fiscal revenues  up from in the prior year and consumables sales represented of fiscal revenues  down from in the prior year 
the gross margin rate remained constant in fiscal versus even with the continuing shift in revenue mix towards systems versus consumables sales 
this reflects  in part  the benefit of lower costs on the standard product line as a result of increased production levels 
operating expenses of million increased million over the prior year  however expressed as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses decreased to from in fiscal marketing expense of million increased million as compared to the prior year  however  expressed as a percentage of revenues  marketing expense decreased to from in the prior year 
this reduction reflected management s ability to leverage marketing activities against a higher revenue base 
research and engineering expense in fiscal increased million to million as compared to fiscal this increased spending included continued development of the fresher under pressure technology as well as research in other areas of the company s products and applications 
management will continue to aggressively pursue technological advances through increased research and engineering spending 
as a percentage of revenues however  research and engineering expenses were in both fiscal and general and administrative expense of million increased million for the year as compared to the prior year 
over one half of this increase is attributable to the inclusion of the fiscal acquisitions of foracon and cis 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were comparable to the prior year 
operating income can vary significantly for domestic and foreign operations  but is primarily the result of product mix variations and volume from year to year 
net interest expense of million increased  in fiscal compared to this increase results from higher debt levels associated with an increased level of production and capital additions as well as borrowings related to the fiscal acquisitions 
during fiscal  other expense  net  totaled  compared to other expense  net  of  in fiscal income tax expense was of income before tax as compared to in the previous year 
the income tax rates were lower than the statutory rates in both the current and prior year due primarily to lower foreign tax rates  benefits from the foreign sales corporation  and an ongoing review of the company s valuation allowance 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is  and  respectively  for fiscal and  and  respectively  for fiscal the company recorded fiscal uhp net income of million  or 
basic and 
diluted earnings per share as compared to million  or

diluted earnings per share in fiscal access and services operations analysis the following pro forma table presents the results of operations of the access and services business units  including the restructuring charges in thousands year ended april  revenue   gross profit   operating expenses   operating loss   interest other expense  net pretax loss   the differences between fiscal and occurred as a result of the sale of these businesses during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company generated million in cash flow from operations during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cash flow in fiscal was impacted by increases in both trade accounts receivable and inventory as discussed further below as well as reductions in accrued liabilities 
the company invested million in property and equipment during fiscal of which million related to fresher under pressure 
additionally  the company paid million net of cash acquired for pressure systems and spent million to repurchase company common stock 
total debt at april  was million  an increase of million from april  management believes that the available credit facilities and working capital generated by operations will provide sufficient resources to meet its operating and capital requirements for the next months 
the company s credit agreement and private placement require the company to comply with certain financial covenants 
the covenants were amended as a result of the pressure systems acquisition 
as of april   the company was in compliance with all such covenants  as amended 
the fiscal consolidated statement of cash flows reflects the disposition of the access and services businesses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of long term debt maturities 
long term debt obligations are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other indebtedness 
capital spending plans currently provide for outlays of approximately million to million in fiscal of this amount  approximately million to million relates to manufacture of the continuous feed fresher under pressure assets 
the timing of these continuous feed asset additions will be determined by market demand 
it is expected that funds necessary for these expenditures will be generated internally  and through available credit facilities 
gross trade accounts receivable of million at april  increased million from april  the april  amount includes the march acquisition of pressure systems 
exclusive of the acquisition  gross accounts receivable were flat compared to april  days sales outstanding in gross accounts receivable is negatively impacted by the traditionally longer payment cycle outside the united states 
additionally  longer payment terms are sometimes negotiated on large system orders 
management does not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on the company s short term liquidity requirements 
inventory of million at april  represents an increase of million compared to april  excluding the march pressure systems acquisition  inventories increased million compared to april  approximately million of this increase is inventory for the continuous feed fresher under pressure technology 
certain products manufactured by the company s robotics and automation divisions require an extended manufacturing period  and therefore involve higher levels of work in process 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in the company s financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates as well as adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
these exposures are related to the daily operations of the company 
interest rate exposure at april  the company had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount million was fixed rate debt with interest rates ranging from to per annum 
the remaining debt of million was variable with million of this total bearing a rate of libor or at april  the majority of the remaining floating rate debt was at prime  
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on the company s debt obligations 
at april  the fair value of the company s debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to the company s pretax profits and cash flow of  at april  the company had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
the company may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the german mark  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swedish crown 
the assets and liabilities of its foreign operations  with functional currencies other than the us dollar  are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the determination of net income have not been material 
based on the company s overall currency rate exposure at april   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
at april   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar was also determined to have an insignificant effect 
year issues and conversion background some computers  software  and other equipment include programming code that limits the year field to two digits 
thus  these systems could fail in the event that the last two digits are interpreted to mean the year for this reason  the company began the conversion process to upgrade its systems in fiscal assessment the year issues could effect computers  software  and other equipment used  or maintained by the company 
the company has reviewed its internal computer programs and systems to determine if the programs and systems are year ready 
the company believes that its computer systems will be year ready in a timely manner 
to date  the company has converted and tested its primary computer system and is currently upgrading the internal computer systems of its subsidiaries 
the estimated costs of these efforts are  and are not expected to be material to the company s financial position or any of its financial results from operations 
there can however be no assurance to this effect 
to date  no other information technology projects that have a material effect on the company s operations have been deferred 
software sold to customers the company develops its own proprietary software that controls the functions of some of its machines 
the company also sells software or other electronic control devices purchased from third party vendors 
the company believes that it has substantially identified and resolved all potential year issues with any of its software products 
however  the company believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that its products are entirely year ready 
as with most software  it is dependent upon hardware and other operating systems that are provided by other third party vendors not under the company s control 
internal infrastructure the company is in the process of reviewing all of its equipment that is used in the receiving  manufacturing  and shipping of its products as well as its copiers  fax machines  elevators  telephone systems and other equipment used to maintain daily operations 
to date  the company has not identified any material issues that would affect the ongoing operations 
the company is on schedule with its review of these systems and does not expect any required modifications to have a material adverse effect on its future financial results 
however  the company is continuing to monitor the process and this estimate will be revised if additional material information is discovered 
suppliers the company initiated communications with all of its critical suppliers in april the form of this communication was by questionnaire designed to determine the year readiness of the suppliers business systems 
in addition  the company has met in person with the company s primary suppliers to review year readiness 
the company is in the process of evaluating supplier responses 
based upon responses to date  the company believes that its critical suppliers will be year ready and does not currently expect any adverse effects on its daily operations 
while the company does not expect any material adverse effects  the company can provide no assurance that these suppliers will resolve all of their year issues on a timely basis 
the company will continue to monitor this process and revise its expectations as needed 
risks while the company is taking steps in all areas discussed above  there can be no assurance that all year issues will be entirely resolved 
due to this inherent uncertainty  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  there could be interruptions or failures that would materially impact normal business operations 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the potential of any such material adverse effects 
further  the year project includes the development of contingency plans for those systems that are critical to daily operations 
readers are cautioned that the forward looking statements contained in the year issues and conversion should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading safe harbor statement
