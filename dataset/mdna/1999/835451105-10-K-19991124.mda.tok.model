comparison of fiscal to fiscal total revenues increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year company owned restaurant sales increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year of the million increase in company owned restaurant sales  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal average sales increases of approximately by stores open throughout the full reporting periods of fiscal and accounted for million of the increase 
one hundred thirty nine franchise drive ins opened in fiscal compared to in fiscal  with the contribution of franchise fee revenues increasing 
in addition to the larger store count  this increase resulted from a higher proportion of drive ins opening under the current form of license agreement which requires a  franchise fee 
franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately million resulted from the franchise same store sales growth of in fiscal approximately million was due to the conversion of certain stores to new license agreements which became effective on january  the balance of the increase was attributable to additional franchise restaurants in operation 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal food and packaging costs decreased basis points as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  as a result of reduced discounting from standard menu pricing as well as overall lower unit costs  particularly lower ice cream mix costs 
payroll and other employee benefits  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  were down basis points from fiscal due to lower pre opening costs as a result of fewer company store openings and worker s compensation refunds received during the year 
margin improvements resulting from the leverage of operating at higher volumes were offset by an increase in the average wage rate resulting from unfavorable conditions in the labor market and an increase in the labor hours per store 
the increase in labor hours resulted from the company s continued efforts to provide superior customer service 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted from higher marketing expenditures  increased landscaping and repair costs associated with the sonic retrofit  and higher repair and maintenance costs resulting from the outsourcing of point of sale support which was handled internally during fiscal the increase in marketing expenditures reflects the company s commitment to increased media efficiency through its system of advertising cooperatives 
as a result of the increase in restaurant operating margins  minority interest in earnings of restaurants increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal many of the managers and supervisors of company owned restaurants own a minority interest in the restaurants  and their compensation flows through the minority interest in earnings of restaurants 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal management expects selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  to continue to decline in future periods because of a declining rate of increase in the number of corporate employees and because the company expects a significant portion of future revenue growth to be attributable to company owned restaurants 
company owned restaurants require a lower level of selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than the company s franchising operations since most of these expenses are reflected in restaurant cost of operations and minority interest in restaurant operations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased or million in fiscal resulting primarily from new drive in development and retrofits of existing restaurants 
management expects this trend to decrease reflecting the slower rate of growth in company stores as well as the impact of sold stores 
during fiscal year  four drive ins became impaired under the guidelines of fas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
two additional drive ins were written down due to accessibility and expiring lease issues 
as a result  a provision for impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded for the drive ins carrying cost in excess of the present value of estimated future cash flows 
income from operations increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year excluding a million special provision for litigation settlement recorded in fiscal 
net interest expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal this increase was the result of additional borrowings to fund share repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million 
the company expects interest expense to increase in the to range during fiscal year depending on the level of future share repurchases 
provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal and net income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  excluding the special provision for litigation settlement and before the cumulative effect of accounting change 
diluted earnings per share increased to per share in fiscal  compared to per share before cumulative effect of accounting change and the special provision for litigation settlement in fiscal  for an increase of 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal company owned restaurant sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million increase in company owned restaurant sales  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal average sales increases of approximately by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal and fiscal accounted for million of the increase 
franchise fee revenues increased to million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal  primarily resulting from the opening of new franchise restaurants in fiscal compared to in fiscal franchise royalties increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increased sales by comparable franchised restaurants resulted in an increase in royalties of approximately million and resulted from the franchise same store sales growth of over fiscal additional franchise restaurants in operation resulted in an increase in royalties of million 
the decrease in other revenues of approximately million resulted primarily from the fiscal year gain on the sale of the company s minority interest in restaurants 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the reported decline in operating margins resulted primarily from the company s adoption of a new accounting standard  sop  which requires that pre opening and other start up costs be expensed as incurred 
the company previously capitalized such costs and amortized them over months 
implementation of the standard resulted in the reclassification of expenses from depreciation and amortization into restaurant cost of operations 
the following table sets out the pro forma operating margins for fiscal and as if the company had adopted the new standard as of the beginning of fiscal year ended august  august  pro forma margin analysis company owned restaurants food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits other operating expenses the following discussion is based on the pro forma margin analysis 
management believes the decrease in food and packaging costs resulted from the negotiation of more favorable contracts with suppliers  a reduction in promotional discounting from standard menu prices and a continued shift in product mix toward higher margin items such as drinks and ice cream 
the increase in payroll and other employee benefit costs resulted primarily from an increase in the hourly wage rate related to a minimum wage increase which was effective september  without a corresponding increase in pricing 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted primarily from increased marketing expenditures  which reflects the company s commitment to increased media penetration through its system of advertising cooperatives 
minority interest in earnings of restaurants decreased  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to in fiscal versus in fiscal this decrease reflected the minority partners share of depreciation expense associated with the roll out of a point of sale system 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to decline in future periods  as a percentage of total revenues  because the company plans to add fewer corporate employees  as a percentage of the existing corporate employee base  than in previous periods 
this strategy is expected to result in revenues growing at a higher rate than selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million due to the purchase of buildings and equipment for new restaurants  retrofit expenditures for existing restaurants and information systems upgrades 
the company recorded a million special provision for litigation settlement in the third fiscal quarter of as a result of the denial by the supreme court of the state of texas of the company s appeal of a decision by the texas court of appeals in a real estate related lawsuit

the estimated cost to complete construction of these restaurants was million 
the company believes that existing cash and funds generated from internal operations  as well as borrowings under the line of credit  will meet the company s needs for the foreseeable future 
year description 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded computer chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations which could disrupt the company s normal business activities 
to date  the company has established a plan to prepare its systems for the year issue as well as to reasonably assure that its critical business partners are prepared 
the phases of the company s plan to resolve the year issue involve awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
to date  the company has completed its assessment of all internal systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue 
based upon its assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software primarily related to customized interfaces between its financial systems and other applications 
the company believes that with modifications or replacements of the identified software programs  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if all additional phases of the year plan are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company as set forth under risks and contingency plans 
status 
the company s internal information technology exposures are primarily related to financial and management information systems 
as of august   the company had completed the remediation of existing custom developed software and had completed the necessary replacement of certain package software with year compliant versions 
as of august   the company had completed its testing and had implemented all necessary remediated applications 
the company s non information technology systems consist primarily of restaurant operating equipment including its point of sale systems 
while the company believes the primary functionality of its point of sale systems is not impacted by the year issue  the assessment of these systems has indicated that an upgrade to a windows nt operating system will be necessary to address certain ancillary reporting functions 
as of november   the company had substantially completed the upgrade to the windows nt operating system in the company owned stores 
the remainder of the point of sale systems in the company owned stores will be upgraded by november  significant third parties 
the company s significant third party business partners consist of suppliers  banks  and its franchisees 
the company does not have any significant system interfaces with third parties 
an inventory of significant suppliers and distributors has been completed and letters mailed requesting information regarding each party s year compliance status 
additionally  the company has met with approximately key suppliers and distributors to discuss their year readiness 
the company s process of developing contingency plans with each of its key suppliers was completed september  letters were sent to all relationship banks before january  requesting an update on their year compliance status 
review and evaluation of responses is complete 
based on the banks information provided to sonic  management of sonic believes all relationship banks have adequately addressed year concerns 
a year information manual and certain other correspondence has been sent to all franchisees explaining the year issue and associated business risks 
the company will continue its efforts to raise awareness and inform franchisees of the risks posed by the year through its regional meeting processes and continued correspondence 
costs 
the company s year plan encompasses the use of both internal and external resources to identify  remediate  test and implement systems for year readiness 
external resources include contract resources which will be used to supplement available internal resources 
the total cost of the year project  excluding non incremental internal personnel costs  is estimated at thousand and is being funded by operating cash flows 
as of august   the company had incurred costs of approximately thousand  of which thousand has been expensed and thousand has been capitalized 
risks and contingency plans 
management of the company believes it has an effective plan in place to address the year issue in a timely manner 
however  due to the forward looking nature and lack of historical experience with year issues  it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen after december  despite the year remediation efforts being made  it is likely that there will be disruptions and unexpected business problems during the early months of the company has made diligent efforts to assess the year readiness of its significant business partners and has developed contingency plans for critical areas where it believes its exposure to year risk is the greatest 
however  despite the company s efforts  it may encounter unanticipated third party failures  more general public infrastructure failures or a failure to successfully conclude its remediation efforts as planned 
if the company s efforts to mitigate year exposures are not successful  in addition to the implications noted above  the company may be required to utilize manual processing of certain otherwise automated processes primarily related to partner compensation and cash management 
any one of these unforeseen events could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in and beyond 
additionally  the inability of franchisees to remit royalty payments on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the amount of potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
impact of inflation though increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations  management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
seasonality the company does not expect seasonality to affect its operations in a materially adverse manner 
the company s results during its second fiscal quarter the months of december  january and february generally are lower than other quarters because of the climate of the locations of a number of company owned and franchised restaurants 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and notes receivable  as well as changes in commodity prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of its senior notes  outstanding line of credit and notes receivable 
the senior notes bear interest at fixed rates which average 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of august  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
as of august   the carrying amount of the senior notes exceeded the estimated fair value by approximately million 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was million as of august  the company has made certain loans to its store operating partners and franchisees totaling million as of august  the interest rates on these notes are generally between ten and eleven percent 
the company believes the fair market value of these notes approximates their carrying amount 
the impact on the company s results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balances under the senior notes  line of credit and notes receivable as of august   would be immaterial 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps  however  the company has not committed to purchase any minimum quantities under these arrangements 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
