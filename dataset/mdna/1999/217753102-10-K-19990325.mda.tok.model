the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of  during the period from inception to december  the company has funded its operations primarily through public equity financings and proceeds from collaboration research and development agreements 
integrilin tm eptifibatide injection is the first product that cor has taken from discovery to commercialization 
integrilin was approved for marketing in the united states by the us food and drug administration fda in may integrilin is indicated for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome or acs encompassing unstable angina and non q wave myocardial infarction  collectively ua nqmi including patients who are to be managed medically and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention pci 
integrilin is also indicated for the treatment of patients undergoing pci 
cor and schering plough ltd 
and schering corporation collectively  schering are worldwide partners for integrilin 
cor and schering co promote the drug in the united states and share any profits or losses 
cor and schering launched integrilin in june in the united states 
see marketing and sales strategy 
total sales of integrilin to wholesalers  as reported to the company by schering  were  from launch in june through december  product sales as reported by schering for the period from launch in june to december  are not necessarily indicative of product sales for any future period 
schering has the right to launch integrilin in the european union eu as an exclusive licensee on a royalty bearing basis for a period of time 
in february  schering announced that the committee for proprietary medicinal products cpmp of the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products issued a positive opinion recommending approval of integrilin for the prevention of myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ua nqmi 
the cpmp opinion serves as the basis for a european commission approval  which is typically issued in approximately four months 
the company believes that the commission approval of the centralized marketing authorization application for integrilin would result in a single marketing authorization with unified labeling that would be valid in all european union member states 
schering submitted the centralized marketing application in february integrilin has received regulatory approval in a number of countries outside the eu and the united states 
cor and schering are conducting or have conducted phase ii clinical trials of integrilin with different thrombolytics in the setting of acute myocardial infarction 
cor and schering also sponsor additional clinical trials of integrilin in a variety of clinical settings 
in addition to its commercial activities  cor continues to pursue a wide array of research and development programs 
the company s next potential product is an oral glycoprotein iib iiia gp iib iiia inhibitor to prevent platelet aggregation 
results to date of phase i and initial phase ii studies for the company s lead compound  cromafiban  show that it has high affinity and specificity for gp iib iiia 
inhibition of platelet aggregation by cromafiban has been shown to be dose and concentration dependent 
plasma concentrations have indicated a sufficiently long elimination half life to allow for once daily dosing with a low peak to trough ratio and low inter patient variability 
no food interactions have been observed 
bleeding was the most prevalent complication encountered during cromafiban therapy in clinical trials conducted to date 
cor is also conducting preclinical research and development in several other cardiovascular programs 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total contract revenues were  in compared to  in and  in copromotion revenue in was  resulting from amounts due to the company from schering related to the sales of integrilin tm eptifibatide injection by schering from launch in june through december  milestone revenues in include  received from schering in connection with the regulatory approval of integrilin for certain indications in the united states and  from schering in connection with the acceptance for review of the centralized marketing authorization application seeking marketing approval for integrilin in the eu 
milestone revenues in were  received from schering in connection with the completion of pursuit  a large phase iii clinical trial for integrilin 
milestone revenues in include  received from schering in connection with the safety of integrilin and  received from schering in connection with clinical studies of integrilin 
development and other contract revenues were  in compared to  in and  in development and other contract revenues in were lower than in  primarily due to the completion of pursuit in the first half of the company expects total contract revenues to continue to fluctuate in the future 
cost of copromotion revenue was  in cost of copromotion revenue includes certain manufacturing related and marketing expenses incurred in connection with the collaboration with schering 
research and development expenses were  in compared to  in and  in the decrease in compared to and the decrease in compared to both resulted from the timing of activities of pursuit  offset in part by increases in headcount and other research  development and clinical activities associated with other potential products 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase over the next several years  although the timing of certain of these expenses may depend on the timing and phase of  and indications pursued in  additional clinical trials of integrilin and other product candidates in development 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in and  in the increase in compared to was primarily due to the addition of marketing and sales personnel for the commercialization of integrilin  as well as increased staffing and administrative expenses associated with general corporate activities 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to pre commercial activities associated with integrilin  as well as increases in staffing and administrative expenses associated with general corporate activities 
the company expects marketing  general and administrative costs to continue to increase significantly over the next several years 
interest income was  in compared to  in and  in the increase in compared to and the decrease in compared to were primarily due to changes in cash and investment balances

the company incurred a net loss of  in and  accordingly  no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded 
at december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately  the company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods 
the company believes  however  that this limitation will not have a material impact on its future operating results 
liquidity and capital resources the company had available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  at december  cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested according to the company s investment policy 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
from inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through public equity financings and proceeds from collaboration research and development agreements 
additional funding has come from private equity financings  grant revenues  interest income and property and equipment financings 
at december   the company had approximately  available under an equipment financing facility 
net cash used for operating activities and additions to capital equipment decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to the timing of activities related to the agreement with schering  including milestone revenues received  partially offset by increased expenses 
the company anticipates that its expenditures for operating activities and additions to capital equipment will increase in future periods 
the timing of these expenditures may vary from period to period depending on the timing and phase of  and indications pursued in  additional clinical trials of integrilin tm eptifibatide injection and clinical trials of product candidates in development 
cash provided by financing activities of  in   in and  in result primarily from the issuance of common stock  including a public equity financing in  and the net effect of property and equipment financings 
the company expects its cash requirements will increase in future years due to costs related to continuation and expansion of research and development  including clinical trials and increased marketing  sales  general and administrative activities 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources and interest earned thereon will enable it to maintain its operations at least through the end of however  the company s capital requirements may change depending on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical and clinical studies and the number and nature of the indications the company pursues in clinical studies 
the company s capital requirements may also change due to the timing of regulatory approvals  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of the company s future products and the status of competitive products 
the company s capital requirements may also change because of other unanticipated circumstances 
in addition  expenditures may be dependent on the establishment and maintenance of collaboration relationships with other companies  the availability of financing and other factors 
the company may need to raise substantial additional funds in the future 
such funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if such funds are unavailable  the company may need to delay or curtail its research and development activities to a significant extent 
the company s business is subject to significant risks including  but not limited to  the successful sales  distribution and manufacture of integrilin  the success of its research and development activities  the length and expense of obtaining regulatory approval and the results of clinical trials 
other significant risks include uncertainty related to the availability of future funding  uncertainty related to third party reimbursement for the company s product and or potential products  and uncertainty related to its collaborative relationships 
in addition  the company s product candidates may be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  uneconomical to market or precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of other parties 
additional expenses  delays and lost opportunities that may arise out of these and other risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the company uses and relies on a wide variety of information technologies  computer systems and scientific equipment containing computer related components 
some of the company s older computer software programs and equipment may use two digit fields rather than four digit fields to define the applicable year ie  in the computer code refers to the year as a result  time sensitive functions of those software programs and equipment may misinterpret dates after january  to refer to the twentieth century rather than to the twenty first century ie  could be interpreted as rather than this condition is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has developed a strategy to address the potential exposures related to the year issue on its operations for the year and beyond 
a review of key financial  informational and operational systems has been completed 
plans for implementation and testing of any necessary modifications to these key computer systems and equipment to ensure that they are year compliant have been or are in the final stages of development to address computer system and equipment problems as required by december  the company believes that with these plans and completed modifications  the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  even if these modifications are made in a timely fashion  they still may not prevent a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
if such a material adverse effect were to occur  the magnitude of it cannot be known at this time 
the company currently has no contingency plans to deal with major year failures  although such plans will be developed over the coming quarters if they are deemed necessary 
in addition to risks associated with the company s own computer systems and equipment  the company has relationships with and is to varying degrees dependent upon  a large number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to the company 
these include corporate partners  suppliers  vendors  financial institutions and governmental entities 
these other organizations may not adequately address the year issue and their failure to address the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has instituted a review of key third parties to assess their readiness to address the year issue 
the total cost of systems assessments and modifications related to the year issue has been and is being funded through operating cash flows and has not been material to date 
the company has been and is expensing these costs as incurred 
the company has identified resources to address the year issue 
the aggregate financial impact to the company of addressing the year issue cannot be known precisely at this time  but it is currently expected to be less than  the actual financial impact may exceed this estimate 
the financial impact is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
financial market risks the company is exposed to interest rate risk on the investments of its excess cash 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company invests in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  the company invests in short term securities and maintains an average maturity of less than years 
due to the nature of its short term investments  the company has concluded that it does not have a material market risk exposure
