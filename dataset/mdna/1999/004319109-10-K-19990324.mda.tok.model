market risk access worldwide is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business or from acquisitions made 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate changes 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of these changes on earnings and cash flow 
the company manages interest rate exposure through the debt to equity ratio required by the loan covenants in its credit agreements and its ability to convert interest rate from the banks base rate to the eurodollar rate see notes and of notes to the company s financial statements 
a increase in interest rates would affect the company s debt obligations and reduce future earnings by approximately  however  a reduction in interest rates would increase the future earnings by approximately the same amount 
year issue as a rapidly growing outsourced marketing service company  the company is dependent on computer systems and applications to conduct its business 
some computer systems and applications include programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than these problems are commonly referred to as the millennium bug or year problem 
the company has developed and is currently executing a comprehensive risk based plan designed to make its computer systems  applications and facilities year ready 
the plan covers four stages including i identification  ii assessment  iii remediation  and iv testing 
the company has completed the process of identifying all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with its internal operations that must be modified  upgraded  or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company is currently in the process of the assessment and remediation stages of modifying  upgrading  and replacing major systems that have been identified as adversely affected  and expects to complete this process before the end of the second quarter of the testing stage is projected to be completed by the third quarter of in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  elevators and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company continues to assess the potential effects of  and cost of remediating  the year problem on its office equipment 
the company has incurred costs to date of  and estimates the total cost of any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of its internal systems to be  while the estimated cost of these efforts is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or any year s results of operations  there can be no assurance to this effect 
the estimated cost will be monitored and will be revised as additional information becomes available 
the company is communicating with its major clients and suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year problems 
there can be no assurance that these clients and suppliers will resolve any or all year problems with their systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company 
any failure of these clients and suppliers to resolve year problems with their systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  since the number of devices that could be effected and the interactions among these devices are numerous  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the company is developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting its internal systems 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by second quarter depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of backup equipment and software  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  related to year compliance are forward looking statements 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review
