item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of informix  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results  business and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations the following table and discussion compares the results of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  percent of net revenues net revenues licenses services total net revenues cost and expenses cost of software distribution cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative write off of goodwill and long term assets write off of acquired research and development restructuring charges merger expenses total expenses operating income loss net income loss our operating results for fiscal improved over the prior year due to revenue growth of and a reduction in operating expenses of 
the growth in consolidated revenues was primarily derived in north america as sales increased by in this region during fiscal  while latin america and europe experienced revenue growth of and  respectively  during the same period 
revenues in asia pacific in fiscal  while consistent with fiscal when translated into us dollars  actually increased on a constant currency basis 
in an effort to keep operating expenses in line with revenues  and as a result of our restructuring initiated in fiscal  we reduced total operating expenses as a percent of net revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the most significant cost cutting efforts were achieved in sales and marketing as we were able to reduce these expenditures  as a percentage of net revenues  from in fiscal to in fiscal in total dollars  sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or 
we believe that research and development is essential to maintaining our competitive position in our primary markets and as a result increased research and development expenditures by in fiscal revenue growth combined with lower operating costs resulted in operating income of million for fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal revenues we derive revenues from licensing software and providing post license technical product support and updates to customers and from consulting and training services 
license revenues 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by us or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
our products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including oems  distributors and value added resellers var s 
license revenues for fiscal increased slightly to million from million in fiscal we believe that this modest increase in license revenues reflected a number of factors which affected us during fiscal  including an overall decrease in revenue growth rates in the rdbms industry worldwide  continued uncertainty in the asia pacific economies and financial markets as well as changes to our european management 
license revenues declined by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal we believe that this decrease was primarily attributable to slowing growth in the market for rdbms products and customer uncertainty about our financial condition at that time 
in addition  we experienced a significant turnover in senior management sales positions during fiscal  which adversely affected sales 
our increased focus on reseller channels in fiscal resulted in a significant build up of licenses that had not been resold or utilized by the resellers 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   revenue from license agreements with resellers is recognized as earned by us when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all of our related obligations have been satisfied 
amounts received from customers and financial institutions in advance of revenue being recognized are recorded as a liability in advances from customers and financial institutions in our consolidated financial statements 
advances in the amount of million and million had not been recognized as earned revenue as of december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we received million in customer advances and recognized revenue from resellers with previously recorded customer advances of million 
included in the million recognized were million of licenses which were resold or utilized by the reseller and million related to contractual reductions in customer advances 
contractual reductions result from settlements between us and resellers in which the customer advance contractually expires or a settlement is structured wherein the rights to resell our products terminate without sell through or deployment of the software 
as of december   we had reached structured settlements with three resellers with remaining rights to resell a total of million of our products 
in accordance with the settlements  the minimum future reduction in customer advances totals million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in order to properly recognize revenue on arrangements where the reseller has duplication rights  we rely on accurate and timely reports from resellers of the quantity of licenses that have been resold or utilized 
in instances where a reseller does not submit a timely report  we accrue royalty revenue through the end of the reporting period provided we have vendor specific historical information 
from time to time  late or inaccurate reports are identified or corrected for a variety of reasons  including resellers updating their reports or as a result of our proactive activities such as audits of the resellers royalty reports 
as a result  revenue from these late or updated reports  which was not previously accrued  is recognized in the period during which the reports are received 
such revenue amounted to approximately million for fiscal we expect that the late or inaccurate reporting of resale or utilization of licenses by resellers and the resulting fluctuations will continue for the foreseeable future 
our license transactions can be relatively large in size and difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
as a result  license transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income loss because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the industry  a disproportionate amount of our license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
we expect that these types of transactions and the resulting fluctuations in revenue will continue 
service revenues 
service revenues are comprised of maintenance  consulting and training revenues 
service revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal service revenues also increased in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal service revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  is attributable primarily to higher initial year maintenance fees and the renewal of maintenance contracts in connection with our installed customer base 
as our products continue to grow in complexity  more support services are expected to be required 
we intend to satisfy this requirement through internal support  third party services and oem support 
consulting and training revenues remained flat at million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal consulting and training revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the growth in the consulting and training practice in fiscal was driven by increased demand for consulting services primarily in north america and in europe 
in addition  some significant large consulting contracts were executed in fiscal and contributed to the significant increase of consulting revenues compared to the prior year 
cost of software distribution change change dollars in millions total cost of software distribution percentage of license revenues cost of software distribution consists primarily of manufacturing and related costs such as media  documentation  product assembly and purchasing costs  freight  customs and third party royalties  and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and any write offs of previously capitalized software 
cost of software distribution decreased to million in fiscal from million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of software distribution as a percentage of license revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of license revenue  was primarily caused by a write down in fiscal of million to net realizable value of certain of our database tool products related to our acquisition of centerview software  inc in the first quarter of fiscal  a decrease in third party software royalties  the write off of certain unused application software in the second quarter of fiscal and a reduction in labor  materials and shipping costs 
amortization of capitalized software remained relatively flat at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in amortization of capitalized software in fiscal over fiscal was due primarily to the release of our object relational universal data option product in the fourth quarter of fiscal the amortization of capitalized software will vary from period to period as new products are released and other products become fully amortized 
cost of services change change dollars in millions cost of services percentage of service revenues cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and training expenses 
cost of services for fiscal decreased by to million as compared to million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of net service revenues to for fiscal compared to for fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases of in average headcount for fiscal over the same period in as well as improved efficiency and better control of outsourced expenses 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal cost of services decreased as a percentage of net service revenues to for fiscal compared to for the same period in during fiscal  gross margins increased relative to both support revenue and consulting training revenue  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of that year 
we believe that the increased margins during fiscal were attributable principally to more efficient delivery of services 
sales and marketing expenses change change dollars in millions sales and marketing expenses percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing programs and related overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased less than to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of a significant reduction in average sales and marketing headcount worldwide 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal in absolute dollars compared to fiscal was a result of continued increased expenses in the early months of fiscal  offset by a significant reduction in overall sales and marketing expenses in the second half of fiscal in connection with our restructuring 
research and development expenses change change dollars in millions incurred product development expenditures expenditures capitalized research and development expenses expenditures capitalized as a percentage of incurred research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project consulting and related overhead costs for product development 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars for fiscal is attributable primarily to increases in salary and benefits and a decrease in the amount of product development expenditures capitalized in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease in capitalized expenditures is attributable to the fact that  during the first half of fiscal  a large portion of expenditures incurred were on products that had reached technological feasibility but had not yet been commercially released 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal is attributable principally to an increase in headcount  which occurred during the early part of fiscal  working on new products and product extensions 
the higher capitalization in absolute dollars of product development expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal also resulted from an increase in the work involved on products that had already reached technological feasibility as they neared their release dates 
general and administrative expenses change change dollars in millions general and administrative expenses percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of finance  legal  information systems  human resources  bad debt expense and related overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal and increased to million from million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in bad debt expense due to our efforts to better manage both the amount and credit risk of our accounts receivable balances  offset by increases in legal and other professional service fees  consulting fees and average headcount 
the increase in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the expansion of our international operations and incremental legal expenses resulting from the stockholders litigation and auditing expenses relating to the restatement of our financial statements 
write off of goodwill and other long term assets during the first quarter of  our japanese subsidiary experienced a significant sales shortfall and operating losses 
accordingly  we evaluated the ongoing value of the subsidiary s long lived assets primarily computer and other equipment and goodwill 
based on this evaluation  we determined that the subsidiary s assets had been impaired and wrote them down by million to their estimated fair values 
fair value was determined by using estimated future discounted cash flows and or resale market quotes as appropriate 
write off of acquired research and development on december   we acquired red brick systems  inc red brick  a provider of scalable decision support solutions for data warehousing  data marts  olap and data mining  in a transaction which has been accounted for as a purchase 
we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to acquire all of the outstanding shares of red brick common stock 
we also reserved an additional million shares of our common stock for issuance in connection with the assumption of red brick s outstanding stock options and warrants 
the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the total purchase price of million included the issuance of stock and the assumption of stock options together million  net of issuance costs  direct acquisition costs of million  accrued merger and integration costs of million and liabilities assumed of million 
of the total purchase price  million was allocated to in process research and development expense that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future uses  million was allocated to cash and short term investments  approximately million was allocated to other tangible assets  million was allocated to capitalized software  million was allocated to the acquired workforce and million was allocated to goodwill 
goodwill  capitalized software and the acquired workforce are intangible assets which will be amortized over their estimated lives  which average five years 
the following two in process research and development projects were acquired in the acquisition of red brick red brick warehouse warehouse a high performance  client server rdbms software product specifically designed for data warehousing  data mart  data mining  and olap applications 
warehouse has been red brick s core product and  as of december  the valuation date  was being sold as version  which was released in january the next version  scheduled for release in mid  is currently under development and is expected to bring a substantially new feature set  with web enablement being the most important 
this feature will open warehouse to environments based on intranet and internet technology  thereby substantially extending the usefulness of the product 
at the time of acquisition  the warehouse project was estimated to be approximately complete and the total cost to complete the project was estimated at million 
red brick formation formation an etml extract  transfer  move  load product which was originally released as version in september the current version as of the valuation date 
formation is considered to be in the early stages of its product life cycle 
new features and functionality are currently under development and will be added in subsequent releases 
version  scheduled for release in may  is expected to add international functionality to the product  thereby allowing formation to be sold via foreign sales channels 
in the fall of  the expected release of version is expected to add more competitive features to the product  including the ability to run on dispersed networks as well as an enhancement of the move capability in etml which has been unaddressed in most competing products 
these new features constitute a significant improvement to formation 
at the time of acquisition  the formation project was estimated to be approximately complete and the total cost to complete the project was estimated at million 
the fair value of the in process technology was based on a discounted cash flow model  similar to the traditional income approach 
the income approach involves five steps the annual after tax cash flows the asset will generate over its remaining useful life are estimated  these cash flows are converted to their present value equivalents using a required rate of return which accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the annual cash flows and for the time value of money  the residual value  if any  of the asset at the end of its remaining useful life is estimated  the estimated residual value is converted to its present value equivalent  and the present value of the estimated annual after tax cash flows is added to the present value of the residual value to obtain an estimate of the asset s fair value 
the discount rate used in discounting the estimated cash flows is based on the risks associated with achieving such estimated cash flows upon successful completion of the acquired projects 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in market conditions and technology 
in developing cash flow estimates  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  characteristics of the potential market for the technology and the anticipated life of the underlying technology 
projected annual revenues for the warehouse and formation projects were assumed to increase from product release through  decline slightly in and decline significantly in which is estimated to be the end of the in process technology s economic life 
cost of software distribution and services  sales and marketing expense  research and development expense and general and administrative expense were estimated as a percentage of revenues throughout the forecast period 
gross profit was assumed to be between and for both the warehouse project and the formation project 
as certain other assets contribute to the cash flow attributable to the two projects  returns to these other assets or capital charges were calculated and deducted from the after tax operating income to isolate the cash flow solely attributable to the two projects 
accordingly  returns were deducted for working capital  fixed assets ie property and equipment and the workforce in place 
informix then discounted the estimated cash flows attributable to warehouse and formation using a discount rate 
the fair value of the in process research and development was allocated as approximately million and million to the warehouse and formation projects  respectively 
the acquisition of red brick was a tax free reorganization under the internal revenue code 
therefore  the charge for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of centerview software  inc centerview  a privately owned company which developed and sold software application development tools 
the aggregate purchase price paid was approximately million  which included cash and direct acquisition costs 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  based on an independent appraisal of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the purchase price was allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired including developed software technology  acquired workforce  in process technology  and goodwill 
the in process technology  which  based on the independent appraisal  was valued at million  had not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and had no alternative future uses in other research and development projects 
consequently  its value was charged to operations in the first quarter of fiscal  the period in which the acquisition was consummated 
the remaining identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over three to five years 
the in process research and development project acquired in the acquisition of centerview consisted of the client server software  data director  that combines the functionality of high end client server tools with the price and openness of visual programming environments 
data director is an integrated development extension for microsoft visual basic that enables companies to build corporate intranet and client server applications in a single environment 
as of the date of acquisition  data director version was considered developed technology while data director versions and were considered in process technology which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have any alternative future uses 
data director version was scheduled for first customer release in july while version was anticipated to reach first customer release in april  with commercial release to occur approximately two to three months after first customer introduction of the product 
the expected aggregate costs to complete both data director versions and were approximately million 
the fair value of the in process technology was based on projected cash flows which were discounted based on the risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows upon successful completion of the acquired projects 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in market conditions and technology 
in developing cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole and for the database application development market  product family revenues  the aggregate size of the database application development market  anticipated product development and product introduction schedules  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of the underlying technology 
projected annual revenues for the data director in process development projects were assumed to increase from product release through  decline slightly in and decline significantly in  which was estimated to be the end of the in process technology s economic life 
gross profit was assumed to be throughout the technology life cycle based on percentages estimated in informix s aggregate business model 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and capital charges to provide a return on other acquired assets were deducted from gross profit to arrive at net operating income 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue and included general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and development costs to maintain the technology once it achieved technological feasibility 
the net cash flows of the in process research and development projects were discounted to their present values using a discount rate of 
this discount rate approximated the overall rate of return for the acquisition of centerview as a whole and reflected the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development projects and the uncertainty of technological advances 
we are currently selling two versions of data director  one for visual basic applications and the other for web applications 
restructuring charges in june and september  we approved plans to restructure our operations to bring expenses in line with forecasted revenues and substantially reduced our worldwide headcount and modified operations to improve efficiency 
accordingly  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for fiscal the significant components of these restructuring changes were severance and benefits  write off of assets  and facility charges 
severance and benefits represented the reduction of approximately employees  primarily sales and marketing personnel  on a worldwide basis 
temporary employees and contractors were also reduced 
write off of assets included the write off or write down in carrying value of equipment as a result of our decision to reduce the number of information superstores throughout the world  as well as the write off of equipment associated with headcount reductions 
the equipment subject to the write offs and write downs consisted primarily of computer servers  workstations  and personal computers that were no longer utilized in our operations 
facility charges included early termination costs associated with the closing of certain domestic and international sales offices 
during fiscal  adjustments of million were recorded to the results of operations 
these adjustments  which appear as a credit to restructuring charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   were due primarily to adjusting the estimated severance and facility components of the fiscal restructuring charge to actual costs incurred 
we have substantially completed actions associated with our restructuring except for subleasing or settling our remaining long term operating leases related to vacated properties 
the terms of these operating leases expire at various dates through accrued restructuring costs totaling million remained as a liability in our consolidated financial statements as of december   of which million related to facility charges 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income interest income for fiscal was million as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal in comparison to fiscal resulted from an increase in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances in fiscal due to increased sales and operating income as well as approximately million in interest income related to income tax refunds received during fiscal the reduction in interest income from fiscal to fiscal was due to a reduction in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances in fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased to million for fiscal from million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense for fiscal consists primarily of interest charges related to payments on capital leases 
interest expense for fiscal and fiscal related to interest charges incurred in connection with financing of customer accounts receivable  in addition to interest charges related to payments on capital leases 
we did not enter into any accounts receivable financing transactions in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net  decreased to a net other expense of million for fiscal from net other income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
other income expense  included million of foreign currency transaction losses and million of foreign currency transaction gains in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
approximately million of the million of foreign currency transaction gains recognized in fiscal resulted primarily from a change in our foreign currency denominated intercompany accounts payable and accounts receivable balances arising from the restatement of our  and financial statements 
other components of other income expense included million and million of net gains on the sale of long term investments in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as well as the downward adjustment of million to the carrying value of certain investments in fiscal income taxes in fiscal  income tax expense resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income 
the expected tax expense of million  computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the income before income taxes  was offset primarily by a million decrease in the valuation allowance and a million net foreign tax benefit 
in fiscal  income tax expense resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the expected tax benefit computed by applying the federal statutory rate to the loss before income taxes was substantially offset by a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets in excess of amounts recoverable through carryback of net operating losses 
accordingly  the net deferred tax asset at december  of million was provided for anticipated irs tax refunds  which were received during fiscal quarterly operating results first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss     preferred stock dividend  value assigned to warrants  net income loss applicable to common stockholders    net income loss per common share basic diluted year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss     preferred stock dividend value assigned to warrants  net income loss applicable to common stockholders     net income loss per common share basic diluted in the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a substantial shortfall in license revenues compared to forecasts  resulting in a substantial loss for the quarter 
the shortfall in revenue was due to slow growth in demand for rdbms products as well as our inability to close a number of sales transactions that management anticipated would close by the end of the quarter  especially in europe 
as a result of the shortfall in license revenues for this quarter  we  in the second and third quarters of fiscal  initiated two internal restructurings of our operations intended to reduce operating expenses and improve our financial condition 
these restructurings included reductions in headcount and leased facilities and the downsizing  elimination or conversion into solutions labs of our planned information superstores 
costs associated with the restructurings totaled approximately million and had a material adverse impact on our results of operations for fiscal see restructuring charges 
additionally  during fiscal  we had a major restatement for all of the periods included in the three years ended december   as well as for the quarter ended march  at that time  our administrative processes were weak which contributed to the existence of significant weaknesses in our internal controls 
following these events  customers were concerned about informix s viability and  accordingly  our management was concerned about whether customers would honor their financial obligations to us 
the restructuring activities and the restatement of financial results impacted the environment in which we operated  and  accordingly  impacted the estimates and assumptions used by management in the preparation of our financial statements 
as of december   we made certain estimates including allowances for uncollectable accounts receivable based on the probability of collections  estimates for product returns associated with ongoing customer uncertainty about our financial condition and contingencies associated with continuing issues related to fiscal these estimates  in the ordinary course of business  change as a result of management actions and environmental changes 
during the last quarter of fiscal and the first two quarters of fiscal  we took a number of actions to help restore customer confidence regarding the ongoing viability of informix 
these actions included i generating a total of million from an offering of series b preferred stock and the exercise of warrants related to outstanding series a preferred stock and increasing the balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  ii visits to key customers by senior management to reinforce our customers confidence in us  iii signing significant new contracts with existing customers and winning new customers in a variety of application areas including data warehousing and web content management  iv demonstrating continued ability to generate a meaningful revenue stream  v decreasing employee turnover and increasing the ability to attract new employees and senior management talent  and vi introducing significant new products and increasing research and development funding 
all of these factors contributed to customers honoring their financial obligations to informix  while reducing the probability of product return and collections problems 
additionally  during the first two quarters of fiscal  the following actions were taken and improvements made in the quality of our accounts receivable balances 
the actions taken included i centralizing european credit and collections for most countries and outsourcing this function to a professional credit and collections firm  ii improving our europe region s accounts receivable aging from a balance of million outstanding greater than days as of december  to a balance of million outstanding greater than days as of june   and iii refining our methodology for estimating general uncollectible accounts receivable over and above specific accounts receivable reserves 
the improvement in both our financial condition and the credit and collections processes which resulted from our actions led to a decrease of risk such that reserves for product return and bad debts were reduced by million and million in the first and second quarters of fiscal  respectively 
as of december   our accrued liabilities included accruals for certain claims against us 
during the first quarter of fiscal  our lawyers determined that there was no merit to a specific claim for which we had recorded a liability of million 
accordingly  we reversed this million accrual during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we reduced an accrued liability related to another specific claim by million and million during the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively  based on a legal opinion and a settlement offer 
we recorded restructuring charges of million and million in the second and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the total restructuring expense decreased by million during the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to adjusting the original estimate of the loss incurred on the sale of land to the actual loss 
we recorded restructuring related adjustments to decrease restructuring expense by million  million  million and million in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively  primarily due to adjusting the estimated severance and facility charges to actual costs incurred 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write down the carrying values of certain of our japanese subsidiary s long lived assets to their fair values 
during the same quarter  we also recorded a charge of million to write down the carrying value of capitalized software development costs for certain products to their net realizable values 
in connection with our acquisition of red brick in december  we recorded a charge to operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million for in process research and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
we believe the actions taken by management improved our operating environment and helped restore customer confidence in our company and its products 
liquidity and capital resources as of or for the year ended december  in millions cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital deficit cash and cash equivalents provided by used in operations cash and cash equivalents used for investment activities cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities operating cash flows 
we generated positive cash flows from operations totaling million for fiscal as compared to cash used in operations of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
this significant increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to our improved profitability in fiscal  offset by significant fluctuations in the effect of restructuring charges and changes in accounts receivable on operating cash flows 
net income for fiscal was million as compared to net losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
we recorded a net credit for restructuring charges of million in fiscal as compared to restructuring expense for fiscal of million 
net accounts receivable increased at december  as compared to december   primarily as a result of an increase of million in net revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal when compared to the same quarter in fiscal investing cash flows 
net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities decreased by approximately million for fiscal compared with fiscal due to our emphasis on controlling costs  including capital expenditures 
the decrease was due in large part to a reduction in capital expenditures to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net of cash proceeds from the disposal of land  property and equipment of million 
this decrease was offset by increased investment in fiscal  totaling million  of excess cash generated from profitable operations 
significant investing activities during the year also included additions to software costs of million 
financing cash flows 
net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities in fiscal and fiscal consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of our common stock and from the issuance of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 
proceeds from the sale of our common stock represent stock options exercised and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
the proceeds totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we raised net proceeds of million through the exercise of warrants issued in conjunction with our series a preferred stock 
in february  the series a preferred stockholders exercised warrants to purchase  additional shares of series a preferred at per share for net proceeds of million 
in november  the series a preferred stockholders exercised their remaining warrants in full to purchase  shares of series a preferred  resulting in million in net proceeds 
these warrants were originally issued in august in connection with the sale of the  shares of series a preferred  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
during fiscal  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  of advances from customers and financial institutions 
we may receive cash  either from the customer  or from a financial institution to whom the customer payment streams due under software license arrangements are sold  prior to the time the license fee is recognized as earned revenue 
if we fail to comply with the contractual terms of the specific license agreement  we could be required to refund to the customer or the financial institution the amount received 
however  we do not believe the refunds of amounts received  if any  would have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other 
during fiscal  we assigned our leasehold interest and our related obligations under an office space lease in santa clara  california to an unrelated third party 
the lease term was for fifteen years and minimum lease payments amount to million over the term 
we remain contingently liable for minimum lease payments under the terms of the assignment 
we have several active software development and service provider contracts with third party technology providers 
these agreements contain financial commitments by us of million  million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
summary 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
disclosures about market rate risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities  municipal bonds  time deposits and certificates of deposits 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily include money market accounts held at various securities brokers and banks 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our investment portfolio at december  average interest rate cost fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate   variable rate   short term investments fixed rate   variable rate long term investments fixed rate   variable rate see definition in note to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies primarily european and asian currencies until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
these foreign exchange forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date which approximate the value and expected settlement date of the underlying transactions 
for contracts that are designated and effective as hedges  discounts or premiums the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are accreted or amortized to other expenses over the contract lives using the straight line method while unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the spot exchange rate are recognized in earnings in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables or payables are recognized  and generally offset 
contract amounts in excess of the carrying value of our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable or payable balances are marked to market  with changes in market value recorded in earnings as foreign exchange gains or losses 
we operate in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific where there are limited forward foreign currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is relatively long  depending on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
we attempt to reduce this exposure by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge up to of the forecasted net income of our foreign subsidiaries of up to one year in the future 
these forward foreign currency exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges and  therefore  are marked to market  accounting for a significant portion of our net foreign currency losses of million in these losses are primarily offset by gains realized in cost of software distribution resulting from these foreign currency movements 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount contract amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate at december  and the forward rate  plus the unamortized premium or discount 
all contracts mature within twelve months 
forward contracts weighted average at december  contract rate contract amount fair value in thousands in thousands forward currency to be sold under contract japanese yen  deutsche mark  korean won   singapore dollar  british pound  australian dollar  netherland guilder  swiss franc  brazilian real  other individually less than million  total  forward currency to be purchased under contract british pound  french franc  swedish krona  danish krone  other individually less than million  total  grand total  not meaningful year compliance general many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than one year  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
we are reviewing and updating the year compliance status of the software and systems used in our internal business processes obtaining appropriate assurances of compliance from the manufacturers of these products and agreements  as necessary  to modify or replace all non compliant products we expect this work to be substantially complete by the fall of in addition  we are considering converting certain of our software and systems to commercial products from third parties that are known to be year compliant 
this conversion will require the dedication of substantial time from our administrative and management information personnel the assistance of consulting personnel from third party software vendors the training of our personnel using such systems based on the information available to date  we believe that we will be able to complete our year compliance review and make necessary modifications prior to the end of we made a significant portion of the software or systems important to our business year compliant by the end of  with the remainder of the mission critical applications scheduled to be year compliant by the end of june to the extent that we are relying on the products of other vendors to resolve year issues  there can be no guarantee that we will not experience delays in implementing such products 
we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our business if key systems  or a significant number of systems  were to fail as a result of year problems or if we were to experience delays in implementing year compliant software products 
state of readiness our year project is divided into four major sections product readiness information systems operations applications software is systems third party suppliers global business processes includes facilities  legal  manufacturing  technical support  sales  product management and development  marketing and finance there are five general phases of our year project applicable to each of the four sections awareness phase 
increasing employee awareness through various forms of communication mission critical inventory phase 
taking an inventory of mission critical items relevant to year including computer hardware  software  telecommunications equipment  embedded controllers within our facilities  and other non computer related equipment  assigning priorities to identified items for assessment and possible renovation  and assessing the status of year compliance of items which we have determined to be material to our business repair or replace phase 
repairing or replacing material items that are not year compliant update testing phase 
testing of updates given by third party suppliers business continuity phase 
designing and implementing contingency and business continuity plans for each internal organization and location during the year rollover period 
material items are those items that we believe have a significant negative impact on customer service  involve a risk to the safety of individuals  may cause damage to property or the environment  or may significantly affect revenue in november  we completed the awareness phase for each of the four sections of the project 
the mission critical inventory phase for each of the four sections was completed by the end of the repair or replace phase for each of the four sections will continue into the first half of as various departments perform tests  or receive compliance information from third party suppliers 
we are performing most of the testing ourselves under the update testing phase  although we have retained third parties to test certain of our key applications 
the level of testing is significantly limited by our technical ability to emulate our complex systems and networks and cost benefit considerations 
we are working on the business continuity phase for each of the four sections 
a working plan of the program should be available during the third quarter of product readiness 
all of our currently supported products are year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance or functionality of our products with respect to four digit year dates or the ability of our products to correctly create  store  process  and output information related to such date data  including leap year calculations 
however  year compliance of our products may be affected by other parts of the system in which they are being used  as discussed below 
our products often depend on data from other parts of the system in which they are being used 
year compliance is not effective unless all of the hardware  operating system  other software  and firmware being used along with our products correctly interpret and or translate date data into a four digit year date and properly exchange date data with our products 
we are testing our products under different scenarios 
throughout the remainder of and beyond  we will continue to improve our testing efforts with each new release of our software products 
from time to time  our year program office updates the recommended version of each product family when a year or dbcentury related product deficiency is found and fixed in a certain interim or maintenance release 
we have made year testing scenarios part of our standard test suite 
our year program office is incorporating the red brick product compliance information and plans into our year program plan 
we expect to complete this incorporation by the end of the first quarter of is systems 
our is systems consist of all computer hardware  systems software and telecommunications 
our current hardware inventory includes pc desktops  pc laptops  unix servers  unix workstations  and nt workgroup servers 
our current software inventory includes windows operating system and ms office products  product development environment tools for unix  and various management systems 
our telecommunications equipment includes both voice and data services  including pbx systems  voicemail  acd  video conferencing  local area networks  wide area networks  and remote access equipment 
testing is ongoing as hardware or system software is renovated or replaced  although  the level of testing is significantly limited by our technical ability to emulate our complex systems and networks and cost benefit considerations 
we began contingency planning in december and expect to be completed with such planning by the third quarter of we expect that all is systems will be compliant by the third quarter of we have already made significant portions of our mission critical applications year compliant 
applications supplied by other vendors are expected to be made compliant  replaced with compliant applications  or retired by early none of our other information technology projects have been delayed due to the implementation of the year project 
contingency planning for this section began in the third quarter of and is expected to be completed by mid third party suppliers 
we are identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers and communicating with them about our plans and progress in addressing the year problem and how their individual compliance can impact our success 
we have begun detailed evaluations of the most critical suppliers 
these evaluations will be followed by the development and implementation of contingency plans where appropriate  which began  in certain departments  in the fourth quarter of  with a scheduled completion date of mid follow up reviews are scheduled through the remainder of global business processes 
we have begun developing plans detailing the tasks and resources required for the global business processes section 
this section includes the hardware  software and associated embedded computer chips that are used in the operation of all of our critical facilities 
it also includes readiness in our key business areas  including finance  technical support  and legal 
all repair and testing of embedded systems  where appropriate  is scheduled to be completed by year end we began contingency planning for this section  where appropriate  in the first quarter of and expect to be completed with such planning by year end costs the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to our financial position 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately million 
the total amount expended on the project through december  was less than million 
the estimated future cost of completing the year project is estimated to be approximately million 
we estimate that this amount will be spent as follows million for capital expenditures to repair or replace software and related hardware approximately million for capital expenditures to repair or replace non is equipment million for non capital expenses for technical support  operations  is operations and applications  and the year program office the year project is expected to significantly reduce our level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of our material third party suppliers 
we believe that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the project as scheduled 
european monetary conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic community entered into a three year transition phase during which a common currency  the euro  was introduced 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals may conduct business in these countries in both the euro and existing national currencies 
on january   the euro will become the sole currency in these countries 
during the transition phase  we will continue to evaluate the impact of conversion to the euro on our business 
in particular  we are reviewing whether our internal software systems can process transactions denominated either in current national currencies or in the euro  including converting currencies using computation methods specified by the european economic community the cost to us if we must modify or replace any of our internal software systems whether we will have to change the terms of any financial instruments in connection with our hedging activities based on current information and our initial evaluation  we do not expect the cost of any necessary corrective action to have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have reviewed the effect of the conversion to the euro on the prices of our products in the affected countries 
as a result  we have made some adjustments to our prices to attempt to eliminate differentials that were identified 
however  we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and other possible effects of the conversion to the euro on our business 
we cannot guarantee that the costs associated with conversion to the euro or price adjustments will not in the future have a material adverse effect on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which establishes guidelines for the accounting for the costs of all computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of sop on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application of sfas is encouraged but should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
we are currently evaluating the requirements and impact of sfas in december  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
this amendment clarified the specification of what was considered vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various elements in a multiple element arrangement 
sop is effective for all transactions entered into by us in fiscal year the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results  financial position or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results we are subject to intense competition and this competition may adversely affect our business we may not be able to compete successfully against current and or future competitors and such inability would materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
moreover  we expect that the technology for rdbms products will continue to change rapidly 
new products are introduced frequently  and existing products are enhanced continually 
competition may also result in changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors which could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including several large vendors that develop and market databases  applications  development tools or decision support products 
our principal competitors include computer associates  ibm  microsoft  ncr teradata  oracle and sybase 
additionally  as we expand our business in the markets of data warehousing and web e commerce  we expect to compete with a different group of companies  including small  highly focused companies offering single products or services that we include as part of an overall solution 
several of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
competition may affect pricing of our products which could adversely affect our business existing and future competition or changes in our product or service pricing structure or product or service offerings could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of our products or services 
if significant price reductions in our products or services were to occur and not be offset by increases in sales volume  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
if such downward pressure on prices were to occur  our operating margins would be adversely affected 
we may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
several of our competitors have announced the development of enhanced versions of their principal database products that are intended to improve the performance or expand the capabilities of their existing products 
new or enhanced products by existing competitors or new competitors could result in greater price pressure on our products 
in addition  the following factors could affect the pricing of rdbms products and related products the industry movement to new operating systems  like windows nt access to rdbms products through low end desktop computers access to data through the internet the bundling of software products for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy by certain of our competitors our own practice of bundling our software products for enterprise licenses or for promotional purposes with our partners in particular  the pricing strategies of competitors in the industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
while we have historically participated in this practice of aggressive price discounting  we are now more closely managing price discounting to encourage smaller  recurring transactions 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors who continue to aggressively discount the price of their products 
our industry changes rapidly due to evolving technology standards and future success will depend on our ability to continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce enhancements to our existing products and new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
we expect that we will have to respond quickly to rapid technological change changing customer needs frequent new product introductions evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete as a result  our position in existing markets or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing products develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances on a timely and cost effective basis meet changing customer requirements match or exceed the product deliveries of its competitors we expect that our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments or be able to attract and retain qualified software development engineers 
any of these events could materially adversely affect our business  quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition 
slower growth in the rdbms market would adversely affect sales of our products if rdbms industry growth rates decline for any reason  the markets for our products will be adversely affected  which would have a negative impact on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
prior to fiscal  the rdbms industry grew significantly  due in part to the continuing development of new technologies and products responsive to customer requirements 
in fiscal and  however  growth rates throughout the industry slowed 
recent instability in the asian pacific and latin american economies and financial markets  which had previously been cited as potentially strong sources of revenue growth for relational database software companies  has introduced additional uncertainty concerning industry growth rates in the future 
if the object relational database management systems ordbms market does not evolve as we anticipate  our business will be adversely affected delays in market acceptance of ordbms products offered by us could adversely effect our results of operations and financial condition 
in recent years  the types and quantities of data required to be stored and managed has grown increasingly complex and includes  in addition to conventional character data  audio  video  text and three dimensional graphics in a high performance scalable environment 
during  we invested substantial resources in developing our ordbms product line 
the market for ordbms products is new and evolving  and its growth depends upon a growing need to store and manage complex data and on broader market acceptance of our products as a solution for this need 
as a result  organizations may not choose to make the transition from conventional rdbms to ordbms 
there are many factors  including some beyond our control  that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our quarterly operating results have varied greatly in the past and may vary greatly in the future depending upon a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this factors that may affect future results section  including many that are beyond our control 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
these factors include changes in demand for our software  including changes in industry growth rates for our products the size  timing and contractual terms of large orders for our software products the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers any downturn in our customers businesses  in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business changes in our pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures  such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors or other factors our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products or enhanced versions of our software changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales seasonal buying patterns which tend to peak in the fourth quarter potential changes in mix of license and service revenue 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been attributable to the licensing of our software products 
changes in the mix of software products and services sold by us  including the mix between higher margin software products and lower margin maintenance  consulting and training  could materially adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
any cancellations or delays in planned customer purchases of our products could materially adversely affect our business and quarterly operating results cancellations or delays of planned purchases 
because we do not know when  or if  our potential customers will place orders and finalize contracts  we cannot accurately predict our revenue and operating results for future quarters 
if there is a downturn in potential customers businesses  the domestic economy in general  or in international economies where we derive substantial revenue  potential customers may defer or cancel planned purchases of our products  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and because a high percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  delays in the recognition of revenues from even a limited number of license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  which could cause net income to fall significantly short of anticipated levels 
effects of historical trend for sales to occur at end of quarter 
our software license revenue in any quarter depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
at the end of each quarter  we typically have either minimal or no backlog of orders for the subsequent quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred  our revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced 
this could materially adversely affect our operating results and could impair our business in future periods 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products could adversely affect our quarterly operating results our sales of software products have been affected by seasonal purchasing trends 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
these seasonal trends materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ending december are typically higher relative to our other quarters  because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements and because of the effects of our sales incentive plans for sales personnel which are measured on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we have historically experienced a substantial decline in revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year relative to the preceding quarter 
generally  we expect our quarter ending september to reflect the effects of summer slowing of international business activity and spending activity generally associated with that time of year  particularly in europe 
any delays in our normally lengthy sales cycles could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results our sales cycle typically takes many months to complete and varies depending on the product  service or solution that we are selling 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large transaction or a number of smaller transactions could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we may have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
our sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through third party distributors 
our future revenue is substantially dependent upon our installed customers renewing maintenance agreements for our products and licensing additional products  our future services and maintenance revenue is dependent on future sales of our software products we depend on our installed customer base for future revenues from services and licenses of additional products 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements  this could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
the maintenance agreements are renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  our current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  our customers may not necessarily purchase additional products or services 
our services revenue and maintenance revenue are also dependent upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in our software license revenue could adversely affect the growth of our services revenue in future quarters 
license revenue in fiscal was million and in fiscal was million  both of which are significantly less than fiscal when license revenue was million 
our executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to our business and such officers and key personnel may not remain with informix in the future the loss of the services of one or more of our senior executive officers or key employees could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior executives and certain other key employees  including certain sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
if we lost the services of one or more of our senior executives or key employees  this could materially adversely affect our business  particularly if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with informix 
of our senior officers and key employees  only mr 
finocchio  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  is bound by an employment agreement  the terms of which are nonetheless at will 
in addition  we do not maintain key man life insurance on our employees and have no plans to do so 
our new executive team may not be able to successfully work together to meet our business objectives  which could adversely affect our business almost all of our executive officers  including our president and chief executive officer  our executive vice president  field operations  and our executive vice president  finance and chief financial officer  have joined us since the beginning of fiscal since joining us  the new management team has devoted substantial efforts to restructuring our sales  marketing and finance organizations after the announcement of the restatement of our financial results for fiscal  and and the first quarter of fiscal as a result of errors and irregularities identified with our revenue recognition practices during these periods 
in addition  in fiscal  we announced that we were restructuring our business to expand our e commerce and data warehousing capabilities 
our management team has not worked together previously and may not be able to successfully implement this strategy 
if our management team is unable to accomplish our business objectives  it could materially adversely affect our business and our future quarterly and annual operating results 
pending litigation could materially adversely affect our business since april   various holders of our common stock have filed over separate lawsuits against us  ernst young llp who served as our former independent auditors  and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in particular  the lawsuits could harm our relationships with existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
the continued defense of the lawsuits could also result in the diversion of management s time and attention away from business operations  which could adversely affect our business 
the lawsuits could also have the effect of discouraging potential acquirors from bidding for us or reducing the consideration they would otherwise be willing to pay in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of these lawsuits  by settlement or otherwise  the size of any such payment could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
most of the lawsuits have been filed as purported class actions by persons who claim that they purchased our common stock during a purported class period 
the complaints allege violations of federal and state securities laws  fraud  and violations of california s unfair business practices statutes 
the complaints  in general  do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek 
there are pending federal and state securities actions which are in the early stages of discovery 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
we have not set aside any financial reserves relating to any of these lawsuits 
for a further description of the nature and status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved see item legal proceedings 
limitations of informix director and officer liability insurance may adversely affect our business our liability insurance for actions taken by officers and directors during the period from august to august  the period during which events related to securities class action lawsuits against us and certain of our current and former executive officers occurred  provide only limited liability protection 
if these policies do not adequately cover our expenses related to those class action lawsuits  it could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
under delaware law  our charter documents  and certain indemnification agreements we entered into with our executive officers and directors  we must indemnify our current and former officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law 
the indemnification covers any expenses and or liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with the investigation  defense  settlement or appeal of legal proceedings 
the obligation to provide indemnification does not apply if the officer or director is found to be liable for fraudulent or criminal conduct 
for the period in which most of the claims were asserted  we had in place three director s and officer s liability insurance policies  each providing million in coverage for a total of million 
however  our insurance carriers assert that not all of the actions implicate coverage under our insurance policies 
in addition  these policies do not provide any separate coverage for us as an entity as opposed to its officers and directors 
moreover  we do not have separate insurance to cover the costs of informix s own defense or to cover any liability for any claims asserted against us during that period 
the pending sec investigation could adversely affect our business in july  the sec issued a formal order of investigation of us and certain unidentified individuals associated with us 
the investigation relates to non specified accounting matters  financial reports  other public disclosures and trading activity in our stock 
while we do not know the current status of the investigation or any possible actions that may be taken against us as a result of the investigation  any action could adversely affect our business 
we may be unable to integrate red brick into our business successfully if we do not successfully integrate red brick into our business  this could materially adversely affect our business and future operating results 
additionally  we may never achieve the anticipated synergies from the acquisition of red brick  including marketing  distribution or other operational benefits 
our acquisition of red brick  which was completed in december  requires that we integrate red brick s business and operations into our own 
we acquired red brick with the intent of expanding our data warehousing capabilities  including data warehousing consulting and research and development expertise 
potential problems with this integration could include impairment of relationships with red brick customers the inability to retain a sufficient number of red brick s key employees  including its existing sales force and professional service personnel difficulties in standardizing sales quotas  territories and incentive compensation plans for sales personnel difficulties in integrating red brick s distribution channels with our existing channels the lack of focus on achieving our core business objectives if our management pays excessive attention to the integration process there are a number of factors associated with international operations that could materially adversely affect our business our international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations problems in collecting accounts receivable longer payment cycles fluctuations in currency exchange rates seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances recessionary environments in foreign economies increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries international sales represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal in particular  instability in the asian pacific and latin american economies and financial markets  which when combined accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  could materially adversely affect our operating results in future quarters 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses for informix despite our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as a consequence  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  as noted previously  the sales cycles for our products is relatively long 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
in addition to the hedging program described above  we have implemented a foreign exchange hedging program consisting principally of the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts  which is intended to hedge the value of intercompany accounts receivable or intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
this program involves the use of forward contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
uncertainties related to the euro conversion could adversely affect our hedging activities 
we may not successfully develop new business areas which could adversely affect our business we have in recent years expanded our technology into a number of new business areas to foster long term growth  including application servers  internet electronic commerce  and data warehousing 
these areas are relatively new to our product development and sales and marketing personnel 
we may not be able to compete effectively or generate significant revenues in these new areas 
data warehousing 
in fiscal we announced that we were entering the data warehousing market 
the acquisition of red brick in december expanded our presence in this market 
although demand for data warehouse software has grown in recent years  the market is still emerging 
our future financial performance in this area will depend to a large extent on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting data warehouses our success in developing partnering arrangements with developers of software tools and applications for the data warehouse market existing customers expanding their use of data warehouses the data warehouse market  however  may not continue to grow and its customers may not expand their use of data warehouses 
a failure of the data warehouse market to grow  or slower growth than we currently anticipate  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
internet computing 
the success of internet computing and  in particular  our current internet computing software products is difficult to predict because internet computing is new to the entire computer industry 
the successful introduction of internet computing to the market will depend in large measure on the commitment by hardware and software vendors to manufacture  promote and distribute internet access appliances the lower cost of ownership of internet computing relative to client server architecture the ease of use and administration relative to client server architecture in addition  sufficient numbers of vendors may not undertake a commitment to the market  the market may not accept internet computing or internet computing may not generate significant revenues for our business 
the widespread acceptance and adoption of the internet by traditional businesses for conducting business and exchanging information is likely only if the internet provides these businesses with greater efficiencies and improvements 
the failure of the internet to continue to develop as a commercial or business medium could materially adversely affect our business 
emerging areas of commerce such as the internet could adversely affect our ability to sell our products the impact of emerging areas such as the internet  on line services and electronic commerce on our business and our ability to sell our products is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
our product offerings may not satisfy new customer demands in these areas 
in addition  standards for network protocols  as well as other industry adopted and de facto standards for the internet  are evolving rapidly 
there can be no assurance that standards chosen by us will position our products to compete effectively for business opportunities as they arise on the internet and other emerging areas 
errors in our products or the failure of our products to conform to customer specifications or expectations could result in our customers demanding refunds from us or asserting claims for damages against us or in decreased sales of our products because our software products are complex  they often contain errors or bugs that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services to identify and correct bugs in our software  we expect that errors in our products will continue to be found in the future 
although many of these errors may prove to be immaterial  certain of these errors could be significant 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
these problems could materially adversely affect our business and future quarterly and annual operating results 
a key determinative factor in our future success will continue to be the ability of our products to operate and perform well with existing and future leading  industry standard application software products intended to be used in connection with rdbms products 
failure to meet in a timely manner existing or future interoperability and performance requirements of certain independent vendors could adversely affect the market for our products 
commercial acceptance of our products and services could also be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and industry periodicals concerning us  our products  business or competitors or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or other factors that could adversely affect consumer perception 
product liability claims asserted against us in the future could adversely affect our business we may be subject to claims for damages related to product errors in the future 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions to the extent local laws treat certain warranty exclusions as unenforceable 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entail the risk of such claims 
in particular  issues relating to year compliance have increased awareness of the potential adverse effects of software defects and malfunctions 
we may be unable to recruit and retain the personnel we need we may be unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  and the failure to do so  particularly in key functional areas such as product development and sales  could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced sales  technical  marketing and management personnel 
since the first quarter of fiscal  we have experienced a significant number of voluntary resignations and have taken selective actions to reduce the number of employees in certain functional areas 
in november  we repriced employee stock options in an effort to retain existing employees and  following further declines in the price of our common stock  effected a second repricing in january the repricing programs may not be effective in retaining existing employees 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  especially developers and sales personnel 
we expect competition for qualified personnel to remain intense  and we may not succeed in attracting or retaining such personnel 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products 
this training will require substantial resources and management attention 
rights of series b preferred stockholders may adversely affect our common stockholders at december    shares of series b preferred remained outstanding 
holders of the series b preferred shares have certain rights that may adversely affect holders of our common stock 
rights to consent to corporate transactions 
our agreements with the purchasers of the series b preferred contain covenants that could impair our ability to engage in various corporate transactions in the future  including financing transactions and certain transactions involving a change in control or acquisition of our assets or equity  or that could otherwise be disadvantageous to us and the holders of our common stock 
in particular  an acquisition may not be affected without the consent of the holders of the outstanding series b preferred or without requiring the acquiring entity to assume the series b preferred or cause the series b preferred to be redeemed 
these provisions are likely to make an acquisition more difficult and expensive and could discourage potential acquirors 
we made certain covenants in connection with the issuance of the series b preferred which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing by  for example  providing the holders of the series b preferred certain rights of first offer and prohibiting us from issuing additional preferred stock without the consent of the series b preferred holders 
conversion rights 
the shares of series b preferred are convertible into shares of our common stock based on the trading prices of the common stock during future periods that are described in the series b preferred financing agreement 
as a result  we are unable to determine the number of shares of our common stock that may ultimately be issued upon conversion 
if the conversion price of the series b preferred is determined during a period when the trading price of our common stock is low  the resulting number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred could result in greater dilution to the holders of our common stock 
we are also obligated to issue upon conversion of the series b preferred additional warrants to acquire shares of our common stock equal to of the total number of shares of common stock into which the series b preferred converts 
the exercise of these warrants will have further dilutive effect to the holders of our common stock 
as of december   series b preferred stockholders had converted an aggregate of  shares of series b preferred into  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
at december    shares of series b preferred remained outstanding and assuming a per share conversion price  were convertible into  shares of our common stock and  assuming such conversion  warrants to purchase an aggregate of  additional shares of our common stock would become issuable upon such conversion 
penalty provision 
the terms of the series b preferred financing agreement also includes certain penalty provisions that are triggered if we fail to satisfy certain obligations 
for instance  we must keep a registration statement effective for the resale of shares of our common stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred shares and upon exercise of the warrants 
we rely heavily on our intellectual property rights which offer only limited protection against potential infringers  if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights  this could adversely affect our business our success will continue to be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our inability to protect our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we currently hold seven united states patents and several pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering our inventions will issue or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis under a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
we also rely on shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  which include a notice informing the end user that  by opening the product packaging or in the case of a click wrap license by clicking on an acceptance icon and downloading the product  the end user agrees to be bound by our license agreement 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  we have licensed the source code of our products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
we have also entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers that generally require release of source code to the customer in the event we enter bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or otherwise ceasing to conduct business 
we may also be unable to protect our technology because our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology policing unauthorized use of our software is difficult the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states shrink wrap and or click wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially adversely affect our business  future operating results and financial condition third parties in the future could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which could adversely affect our business third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
any claim of this type could affect our relationships with existing customers and prevent future customers from licensing our products 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
as a result of these factors  infringement claims could materially adversely affect our business 
potential year problems with our software or our internal operating systems could adversely affect our business third party equipment and software 
we may incur large costs and the disruption of our business if any key systems fail as a result of year problems 
we use third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant 
if this third party equipment or software does not operate properly with regard to the year  we may incur unexpected expenses to remedy any problems 
these costs may materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  if our key systems  or a significant number of our systems  failed as a result of year problems we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our business 
to the extent we are relying on the products of other vendors to resolve year issues  we may experience delays in implementing the products 
the failure to correct a significant year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations which could harm our business 
in addition  we may not have enough available personnel to implement and complete in a timely manner our year project 
customer buying patterns 
purchasing patterns of our customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues 
many companies are spending significant resources to correct their current software systems for year compliance 
customers with limited it budgets who face material year issues may increasingly spend their limited resources remediating these year problems instead of investing in more general it management products such as our products 
we expect this customer focus on remediating year issues to increase as january  approaches 
our products 
if any of our licensees experience year problems as a result of their use of our software products  those licensees could assert claims for damages which  if successful  could materially adversely affect our business  future operating results and financial condition 
in the ordinary course of our business  we test and evaluate our software products 
we believe that our software products are generally year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance of our products with respect to four digit year dates or the ability of our products to correctly create  store  process and output information related to such date data  including leap year calculations 
however  we may learn that certain of our software products do not contain all necessary software routines and codes necessary for the accurate calculation  display  storage and manipulation of such date data 
in addition  in certain cases  we have warranted that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance of our products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability to create  store  process and output information related to such data 
for a more detailed description of our year preparedness assessment  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year compliance 
any acquisition or investment that we may make will be subject to a number of factors which could materially adversely affect our business  any investment or acquisition may dilute existing stockholders in the future we may acquire  or invest in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies that we believe would help us expand or enhance our products and services or help us expand our distribution channels 
if we were to make such an acquisition or investment  the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business and future operating results 
any future acquisition or investment would present risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of or investments in businesses 
the following are examples of such risks difficulty in combining the technology  operations or work force of the acquired business disruption of our on going businesses difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and our common stock 
if the consideration is paid in common stock  this would further dilute existing stockholders 
any amortization of goodwill or other assets resulting from such acquisition transaction could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
costs associated with euro conversion issues may adversely affect our business costs associated with conversion to the euro could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
on january   a new currency  the euro  became the legal currency for eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic community 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals may conduct business in these countries in both the euro and the existing national currencies 
on january   the euro will become the sole currency in these countries 
we have reviewed the effect of the conversion to the euro on the prices of our products in the affected countries 
as a result  we have made some adjustments to our prices to attempt to eliminate differentials that were identified 
we have not completed our review of the impact of conversion to the euro on our business  but it is possible that costs associated with ensuring that our products and internal operating systems are able to effectively work with the euro conversion  or price adjustments resulting from the euro conversion  could be material to our business 
in particular  we are reviewing whether our internal software systems can process transactions denominated either in current national currencies or the euro  including converting currencies using computation methods specified by the european economic community our costs of modifying or replacing any of our internal operating systems whether we will have to change the terms of any financial instruments in connection with our hedging activities our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and the voting rights of the holders of common stock our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series 
of the  shares of preferred stock   shares have been designated series a preferred  none of which is outstanding   shares have been designated series a preferred  none of which shares is outstanding   shares have been designated series b preferred  of which  shares remained outstanding as of december  subject to the prior consent of the holders of the series b preferred  the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others 
certain provisions in our charter documents may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and prevent changes in our management certain provisions of our charter documents are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
these include elimination of the right of stockholders to act without holding a meeting certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings a board of directors divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for shares of our common stock and  consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that grants holders of our common stock preferential rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt 
these rights are denied to any stockholder involved in the takeover attempt and this has the effect of requiring cooperation with our board of directors 
this may also prevent an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
the rights agreement could also discourage potential acquirors from making unsolicited acquisition bids 
delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price for informix common stock and prevent changes in our management we are incorporated in delaware and are subject to the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including those corporations  such as us  whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination would include  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving us and an interested stockholder and the sale of more than of our assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions 
we do not intend to opt out of these antitakeover provisions of delaware law 
our common stock likely will be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  certain of which are beyond our control stock prices and trading volumes for many software companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our common stock would likely decrease significantly 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of market uncertainty about our financial condition or business prospects or the prospects for the rdbms market in general revenues or results of operations that do not match analysts expectations the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors general business conditions in the software industry changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales seasonal trends in technology purchases and other general economic conditions item a
