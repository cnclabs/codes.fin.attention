the increase in operating expenses is reflective of the corresponding increase in production equipment fabrication revenues during the gross profit margin attributable to production equipment fabrication also increased to during  up from during selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million during the increase is attributable to increased personnel and other administrative and selling expenses associated with the dramatic increase in operating activity in each of the company s operating segments as well as increased administrative costs relating to being a public reporting entity

weighted average shares outstanding was affected by the additional shares issued in conjunction with the company s initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources on july   the company completed a million  year lease transaction the equipment lease arranged by chase securities inc the transaction has been structured as a sale and lease back of compression equipment 
the compression equipment was sold to a trust for million and leased back by the company for a year period 
the proceeds of the sale were used to reduce the bank credit agreement 
the compression equipment will continue to be deployed by the company under its normal operating procedures 
additionally  the company has the option to repurchase the equipment from the trust at any time 
the lease provides for a residual value guarantee approximately of the total cost by the company  which is due upon termination of the lease and which may be satisfied by a cash payment or the exercise of a purchase option by the company

the company s cash balance amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  primary sources of cash during were cash provided by internal operations of million and net proceeds of million from the sale of compression equipment the equipment lease 
principal uses of cash during the year ended december  were capital expenditures of million  business combinations and investments in unconsolidated entities of million 
total current assets increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily as a result of increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable at december  increased by million to million 
the increase corresponds with the increase in total revenue realized by the company during in addition  inventories increased by million to million at december  the increase in inventories reflects increases in parts and supplies  work in progress and finished goods as the level of activity in the company s domestic and international rental and maintenance and compressor fabrication segments increased over working capital at december  was also affected by an million increase in total current liabilities at december  to million 
the increase results largely from the increase in vendor accounts payable caused by the expansion of the company s operating activities 
the amounts invested in property  plant and equipment and business combinations during was million which resulted in the addition of approximately  horsepower to the rental fleet

in order to fund the anticipated level of capital expenditures  the company anticipates arranging additional sources of debt and or equity financing during impact of the year many computer systems  software products and other equipment utilize microprocessors in which the year is represented by only two digit entries  as is inferred to be the century 
date sensitive software may interpret a date using as the year rather than the year  which could disrupt operations due to systems failures or software miscalculations 
these date fields need to accept four digit entries to distinguish dates beginning in the year issues related to this situation are commonly referred to as year issues 
primarily to accommodate its growth  the company has installed or plans to install various modifications or upgrade existing computer software and hardware which include  among others things  an accommodation of year issues 
the costs associated with the software modifications are being incurred in the ordinary course of business and are not expected to be material in relation to either future operating results  cash flows or financial condition 
the company expects that all hardware and software upgrades will be completed in mid the company has reviewed its machinery and equipment operation and believes that none of its significant machinery and equipment is dependent on microprocessors which may be materially affected by year issues 
the company has initiated communications with all of its significant customers  suppliers and vendors to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to address year issues where they may otherwise impact the operations of the company 
there is inherent uncertainty related to year issues due to the possibility of failures by third party customers  suppliers and vendors  which cannot be anticipated 
the company cannot guarantee the systems of other companies on which it relies will be converted timely and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  cash flows or financial position 
the company has not developed contingency plans to address any possible operation disruptions resulting from third party failures but will do so by the end of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires that  upon adoption  all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value  and that changes in such fair values be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met 
changes in the values of derivatives that meet these hedging criteria will ultimately offset related earnings effects of the hedged comprehensive income pending recognition in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the effect of adoption will have a material effect on the results of operations  cash flows or financial position
