item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview since our fiscal year ended june   several events have occurred that affect the comparability of our results of operations from period to period 
these events include unusual events in fiscal in late june and through july  general motors experienced a strike 
the strike affected our operations primarily at our industrial filtration management and our industrial container cleaning service lines 
in march  we experienced a fire at our austin  texas facility 
this facility provided parts cleaning within the cleanroom services service line 
the fire caused the facility  and most equipment within the facility  to be unusable 
a portion of the business from this facility was temporarily transferred to our hopewell junction  new york facility and the remainder was temporarily lost to other service providers 
we have obtained a new site for the austin facility and completed construction in august we expect that the new facility will ramp up to pre fire business levels in the second quarter of fiscal acquisitions 
since october  we have acquired businesses that represent an aggregate increase in our revenues of approximately million 
we agreed to pay an aggregate consideration for these businesses of approximately million  which included cash  common stock  preferred stock of one of our subsidiaries and contingent consideration for future performance 
we accounted for each of these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and each are included in our results of operations only from the date of acquisition 
the table below provides information regarding our completed acquisitions 
six of these acquisitions related to our entry in late into a new service line that provides technical cleaning and related services to cleanroom environments 
the six companies have been combined into a single subsidiary of mpw  pentagon technologies group  inc approx

our discussion of results of operations below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes where each of these acquisitions has been described in more detail 
initial public offering 
on december   we completed our initial public offering 
we issued  shares of our common stock in this offering  including the over allotment option  at per share 
the net proceeds to us were million 
during the period in fiscal leading up to our initial public offering and at the time of our initial public offering  numerous events occurred and we recorded certain transactions as described below we terminated the s corporation election for tax purposes of a subsidiary of mpw and paid a distribution of million 
as a result of this termination  we recorded a net non recurring tax benefit of  and a related current deferred tax asset and noncurrent deferred tax liability of million and million  respectively 
we recorded a non cash  non recurring charge of million  net of tax  associated with some of our stock option plans 
we also eliminated the related deferred stock option compensation liability previously recorded because our repurchase obligation for stock options exercised under these stock option plans was eliminated with our initial public offering 
we adjusted the historical lease costs for some facilities leased by us from related parties and recharacterized these leases from capital to operating because of restructured lease agreements 
we purchased the remaining minority stock ownership interests in one of our subsidiaries 
we repaid million of our outstanding liabilities to our principal banks using some of the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
the following adjusted pro forma information eliminates the non recurring events and gives consideration to the remaining events discussed above relating to our initial public offering 
our discussion of results of operations below utilizes this adjusted pro forma information in order to make each of the periods more comparable

general we primarily derive our revenues from services under time and materials  fixed price and unit price contracts 
we recognize revenues from time and materials type contracts based on performance and efforts expended 
we record revenues from non contract activities as we perform services or sell goods 
cost of services includes all direct labor  materials  subcontractor and other costs related to the performance of our services 
cost of services also includes all costs associated with our operating equipment  excluding depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with marketing and sales efforts and costs associated with our information systems 
depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation of operating equipment and amortization of capital leases and intangible assets 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of property and equipment 
we amortize capital leases on a straight line basis over the lease term and goodwill and other intangibles on a straight line basis over periods not exceeding years 
effective july   we changed the estimates of the useful lives of some of our property and equipment to more accurately reflect our actual history of useful lives

revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the acquisitions that were completed since october   which contributed an aggregate of million of revenues 
despite the impact of the general motors strike  the internal rate of growth in revenues in fiscal was 
revenues in the industrial facilities support services segment increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of the acquisitions noted above  which contributed an aggregate of million of revenues

cost of services 
cost of services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenues is the result of improved operating efficiencies in our filtration management and container cleaning service lines offset by the loss of revenues related to the general motors strike and the fire at our austin facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in both fiscal and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the overhead costs assumed in the acquisitions noted above  costs associated with our status as a public company and other investments in our infrastructure to support overall growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is a result of additional goodwill and other intangible assets arising out of the acquisitions noted above and additional capital expenditures related to our growth 
income and operations 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal income from operations decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in income from operations is due to the factors discussed above 
the decrease in operating margin is related to the general motors strike and the fire at our austin facility 
we believe that in the absence of these two events  the operating margin would have approximated that of fiscal income from operations in the industrial facilities support services segment increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of strong internal growth  improved operating efficiencies in our industrial container cleaning service line and the acquisitions noted above 
income from operations decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease in operating margin is due to the lost revenues related to the general motors strike and the fire at our austin facility offset by the improved operating efficiencies in our industrial container cleaning service line 
income from operations in the industrial filtration products and services segment increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal income from operations increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in operating margin is due to improved operating and administrative efficiencies within this segment 
interest expense  net 
immediately following our initial public offering  we had no borrowings under our previous credit facility with our banks 
for this reason  interest expense has been eliminated in the adjusted pro forma information through the first five months of fiscal to give effect as if the repayment of our debt obligations from the proceeds of our initial public offering had occurred as of the beginning of the period 
reported interest expense in fiscal is the result of new borrowings subsequent to our initial public offering  primarily resulting from the acquisitions noted above 
provisions for income taxes 
prior to october   mpw industrial services  inc was an s corporation for income tax purposes and did not record a provision for federal and some state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal and in the adjusted pro forma information for fiscal reflects an effective rate of 
net income and net income per share 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal assuming dilution  net income per share increased to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases are due to the factors discussed above

cost of services 
cost of services increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal cost of services as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenues is the result of a greater percentage of revenues being derived in fiscal from our industrial filtration management customers and from some of our industrial cleaning and facility maintenance customers from which we experienced lower margins as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to the four acquisitions completed in fiscal  costs associated with our status as a public company and other investments in our infrastructure to support overall growth

income from operations in the industrial filtration products and services segment increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal income from operations increased as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase in operating margin is due to improved operating efficiencies within this segment 
interest expense  net 
immediately following our initial public offering  we had no borrowings under our prior credit facility with our banks 
for this reason  interest expense has been eliminated in the adjusted pro forma information in fiscal and through the first five months of fiscal to give effect as if the repayment of our debt obligations from the proceeds of our initial public offering had occurred as of the beginning of each period 
adjusted pro forma interest expense in fiscal is the result of new borrowings subsequent to our initial public offering  primarily resulting from the four acquisitions completed in fiscal provision for income taxes 
prior to october   mpw industrial services  inc was an s corporation for income tax purposes and did not record a provision for federal and some state income taxes

net income and net income per share 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal assuming dilution  net income per share increased to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases are due to the factors discussed above 
weighted average common shares outstanding used in the calculation of net income per share for fiscal and assumes that our initial public offering and repurchase of minority interests had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented 
quarterly results and seasonality our results of operations tend to vary seasonally  with the least amount of revenues generated in the third quarter  higher revenues in the second quarter and the greatest amount of revenues in the first and fourth quarters 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors over which we have no control  including our customers budgetary constraints  the timing and duration of our customers planned maintenance activities and shutdowns  changes in our competitors pricing policies and general economic conditions 
also  some operating and fixed costs remain relatively constant throughout the fiscal year that  when offset by differing levels of revenues  may result in fluctuations in quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of million 
during fiscal  we used million for operating activities and made capital investments of million  net of the insurance reimbursement for capital items destroyed in the fire at our austin facility 
during the period following our initial public offering through june   we borrowed million primarily for the four acquisitions completed in fiscal and for working capital needs 
during fiscal  we completed ten acquisitions that required an aggregate of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the borrowings under our revolving credit facility reached million as of june  subsequent to june   we completed one additional acquisition that required an aggregate of million in cash 
our current borrowings under our revolving credit facility are approximately million 
subsequent to our initial public offering  we initially operated under our previous credit facility with our principal banks  which  as amended  provided us with million of credit availability 
effective november   we entered into our existing credit facility to replace our previous credit facility 
the current credit facility  as amended  provides us with million of revolving credit availability for a three year period  subject to extension by the banks each year on the anniversary of the agreement 
under the terms of our current credit facility  the entire million is available for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
borrowing under our current credit facility is at rates  based on the prime or eurodollar rate  that we believe to be very favorable 
availability of borrowing is subject to the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth  specific levels of interest coverage and maintenance of a specific ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization that we believe will not affect the availability of borrowings under our current credit facility 
we intend to continue our strategy of supplementing our internal growth and expanding our service offerings through acquisitions 
we continue to explore acquisition opportunities and we currently have agreements in principle to purchase other companies that may require the utilization of up to an aggregate of million in cash 
we believe that cash on hand as of june   cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our currently planned capital projects  potential acquisitions and operations for the foreseeable future 
if sufficient acquisition opportunities of significant size develop that would extend our borrowing beyond the capacity of our credit facility  we may be required to obtain additional financing 
year issue many computer systems in use today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify the year 
as a result  such systems will recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause many computer applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
we recognize the need to ensure that year software failures will not adversely impact our operations 
our main information technology it operating and financial system became year compliant effective with a normal software upgrade completed in december we have identified major areas of potential business impact from other it systems and non it devices and initial conversions through normal upgrades and replacements are underway and expected to be completed by october  non it devices include our machinery and equipment used to deliver services 
these are not materially reliant on embedded technology potentially impacted by the year issue 
we expect the cost of achieving year compliance for the remaining it systems and non it devices is to be less than  over the cost of normal software upgrades and replacements 
we are not materially reliant on third party systems eg electronic data interchange to conduct business 
in addition  we have initiated communications with significant vendors  customers and other third parties to confirm their plans to become year ready and assess any possible risk to or effects on our operations 
the responses from these third parties are being evaluated and incorporated into the current detailed assessment scheduled to be completed by september  we intend to develop contingency plans for significant third parties determined to be at high risk of noncompliance or business disruption as well as continue to monitor during the progress of those third parties that could materially affect the operations of mpw 
there can be no assurance that we will correctly anticipate the level  impact or duration of noncompliance by third parties  or that our contingency plan will be sufficient to mitigate the impact 
inflation the effects of inflation on our operations were not significant during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
we have a balance of million on our revolving credit facility at june   which is subject to a variable rate of interest based on the prime or eurodollar rate 
assuming borrowings at june   a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately  per year
