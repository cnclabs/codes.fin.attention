animal health agriculture products decreased compared to  and the specialty business was at the same level as the prior year 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on gross sales for the year resulted in a negative impact on sales of  compared to gross sales for would have been  using exchange rates compared to sales of  the human health segment gross sales of  were  above this segment s increases were in active pharmaceutical ingredients  which were up   pharmaceutical intermediates  up  and chiral technology  up  
imaging chemicals x ray media were down  from active pharmaceutical ingredient sales of  were  above the prior year due to strong demand for our gastro intestinal products used for treating ulcerative colitis  and also due to shipments of a new anti asthma drug and other new products 
active pharmaceutical ingredients include active ingredients used in products for gastro intestinal  cardiovascular  endocrine  central nervous system  respiratory  diuretics  anti infective  anti inflammatory  immunology and various other uses 
pharmaceutical intermediate sales of  were  above due to new products used in migraine medicine and central nervous system applications 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of aminodioxepin aoa  a drug intermediate used in the production of a protease inhibitor for the treatment of aids  due to the demand for the end use drug leveling off primarily from the filling of the distribution pipeline 
chiral technology product sales of  were  above due to the sales from the acquisition of the chiral intermediates business chiragene from celgene corporation in january imaging chemical x ray media sales of  were  below the prior year due to a customer reducing inventories  and another customer deciding to manufacture on a captive basis 
a third customer established a backup supplier as was permitted under a year supply agreement  which further reduced sales 
other product category changes from prior years were not significant 
dollars in thousands  except share data the biotechnology segment gross sales of  are from the company s biowhittaker subsidiary which was acquired in the fourth quarter of  and include their first full year sales as a cambrex subsidiary 
this segment consists principally of cell culture products  including living cell cultures  cell culture media and cell culture media supplements  as well as endotoxin detection products 
sales for from cell culture products were  and sales from endotoxin detection products were  the animal health agriculture segment gross sales of  were  below the level with decreases in agricultural intermediates of  down 
vitamin b was up above and animal health products were at the same level as vitamin b sales of  were above due to price increases put in place in late and volume increases to customers 
animal health sales of  was at the same level as sales of organo arsenical feed additives  the largest product in animal health  remained at levels 
agricultural intermediate sales of  were down  due to reduced demand for crop protection products directly related to the economic conditions in asia 
the specialty business segment gross sales of  increased above sales of performance enhancing chemicals of  were at levels and polymer system sales of  were above performance enhancing chemical sales include over products used in photography  pigments  specialty polymers  fuel or additives  catalysts  and other specialty additives 
key sales increases resulted from increases in thpe  a polycarbonate additive  with growth in export markets  and in castor oil based products and were offset by decreases in photographic products 
polymer system sales of  were above  due to increased demand for a monomer used in high performance plastics offset by decreases in coating products 
export sales from us businesses of  in compared to  in export sales from us businesses were at  compared with  in international sales  comprised of all sites from our operations in europe  totaled  as compared with  in total gross profit of  was  above due mainly to the inclusion of the biotechnology segment for a full year  and the effect of royalty income of  the gross profit included  in royalty income 
the gross margin for all product segments excluding the royalty income was up from in the reduced gross margin in the specialty business segment was due to higher sales of low margin commodity castor oil 
the gross margin for the human health segment excluding the royalty income was  in versus  in due to the general mix of sales 
the royalty income discussed above relates to a technology license agreement signed in late with mylan laboratories for the use of intellectual property related to three pharmaceutical ingredients 
the company has been advised that mylan will no longer enforce its exclusive access to the technology 
the royalty arrangements under the agreements have also concluded 
as previously reported  the company s exclusive license agreement is the subject of various lawsuits 
the company has begun to sell these products on a non exclusive basis in first quarter the company anticipates that it will be able to replace a substantial portion of royalty revenues through sales with additional customers and price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales was in  up from in the increase is mainly due to the inclusion for the full year of the biotechnology segment acquired in the fourth quarter  chiragene acquired in january and the third quarter restructuring charge of  excluding the effect of the biotechnology segment for the first nine months of  the restructuring charge taken in the third quarter  and the chiragene expenses  sg a expenses were  of gross sales versus  of gross sales in the company incurred a restructuring charge of  which includes the non recurring costs resulting from the consolidation of administrative and management functions and resulted in the reduction of employees

compared to gross sales in were  above increases in human health were offset by lower sales in our animal health agriculture and specialty business categories 
biotechnology sales from the acquisition of biowhittaker in the fourth quarter were  the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on gross sales for the year resulted in a reduction in sales of  compared to gross sales for would have been  using exchange rates compared to sales of  the human health segment gross sales of  were  above increases in active pharmaceutical ingredients of  pharmaceutical intermediates of  and personal care of  more than offset lower imaging chemicals x ray media of  dollars in thousands  except share data active pharmaceutical ingredient sales of  were  above due mainly to the introduction of a new generic product in the japanese market used as an anti ulcerative  which resulted in new product sales of  in this increase was also attributable to sales of isosorbide mononitrate  used as a vasodilator in cardiovascular pretreatments  which had strong volume growth in pharmaceutical intermediate sales of  were  above due to the effect of sales of an advanced intermediate of a new protease inhibitor for aids treatment  and the manufacture of aminopyridine  used in a variety of pharmaceutical products 
personal care ingredient sales of  were  above  due to higher sales of several smaller products manufactured and sold to the european market 
the biotechnology segment gross sales of  are from biowhittaker since the date of acquisition 
their products include cell culture and endotoxin detection products 
the animal health agriculture segment gross sales of  were  below animal health sales decreased  agricultural intermediate sales decreased  but vitamin b sales increased vitamin b sales of  increased as compared to with volume increases in europe partially offset by decreased pricing due to competitive pressure 
animal health product sales were  down from  mainly due to a decision to exit a low margin poultry additive 
agricultural intermediate sales of  decreased  from the decrease was due to the unusual amount of a pyridine derivative used in the manufacture of herbicides shipped in under a renegotiated contract 
the shipments in returned to normal levels 
pyridine  which is the largest agriculture product  was at levels 
the specialty business segment gross sales of was  decreased  from performance enhancing chemical sales of  were down compared to and polymer system sales of  were down from performance enhancing chemical sales decreased  
pyridine derivatives returned to pre sales as the result of decreased demand in the asian market 
photographic product sales decreased due to the expected reduction in volume by one half of normal levels from a key customer 
polymer system sales of  decreased  as compared to sales of engineering plastics decreased  from due to a major customer losing to a competitor their largest market of a product used in producing high performance plastics mainly used in the electronics industry 
coatings decreased  from due to reduced sales of low margin castor based products as a result of management s decision to focus on higher margin products  and telecommunications product sales decreased from primarily as a result of a major customer s decision to change their specification of an encapsulant product  but it took some time for customers to reduce existing inventories 
export sales from us businesses were at  compared with  in international sales  comprised of all sales from our operations in europe  totaled  as compared with  in total gross profit in increased to  resulting in a higher gross margin percentage of of gross sales compared with in the gross margin increase was due to an improved product mix of sales to include higher active pharmaceutical ingredients and new pharmaceutical intermediates  production efficiencies  and increased plant throughput  in line with management s continued focus on higher performing  more profitable product lines 
excluding the biowhittaker acquisition  the gross margin would have been selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in  up from in the expense of  was  above primarily due to addition of biowhittaker in the fourth quarter and incremental expenses associated with tax planning strategies 
expenses were reduced by a  recovery of previously incurred environmental costs as a result of a settlement with a prior owner of one of the company s operating facilities 
the company conducts periodic reviews of its environmental and litigation matters  prepares estimates of the range of potential future costs of dollars in thousands  except share data each matter wherever possible  and adjusts the accruals for environmental contingencies as circumstances warrant 
no adjustments were made to this reserve in research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  and represented a increase from a portion of this increase was due to costs associated with the albany molecular contract and the addition of biowhittaker 
as previously announced in november  cambrex recorded a charge of  in the fourth quarter for the value of in process research and development at the time of the acquisition of biowhittaker  inc which was completed on october  this charge  which is consistent with pharmaceutical industry practice  reflects the recognition of the value of the continuing efforts to develop new products in the biotechnology marketplace 
these research and development projects were not commercially viable and had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition 
management intends to continue funding these projects  which will permit biowhittaker to maintain its market leadership position 
the operating profit in was  including the non recurring charge for in process research and development of  versus  in excluding the charge  operating profit would have been  net interest expense of  in reflected a decrease of from the decrease was due to an average interest rate in of compared to in offset by the additional borrowings used to finance the biowhittaker acquisition combined with an increase in the average outstanding debt

the human health segment gross sales of  was  above increased imaging chemicals x ray media of  and chiral technology of  offset pharmaceuticals intermediates which decreased  active pharmaceutical ingredient sales were  the same level as the key products in this segment included gastrointestinal actives sulfasalazine mesalamin  used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis  cardiovasculars diltiazem hcl and sotalil hcl  the endocrine preparation glipizide  and respiratory cromoglycate sodium 
imaging chemical sales x ray media product  which include nipa compounds  of  increased  with the largest increase from one of our us facilities  due to a shift in production by a major customer in from europe to the us chiral technology product sales of  increased  over due to the introduction of various new products 
pharmaceutical intermediate sales of  decreased  due to the effect of the loss a significant customer contract and dollars in thousands  except share data reduced demand for dextromethorphan intermediates used in over the counter cough suppressants  partially offset by the initial sales of an advanced intermediate of a new protease inhibitor for aids treatment 
the animal health agriculture segment gross sales of  was down  from this segment includes vitamin b  animal health products  and agricultural intermediates 
vitamin b sales of  decreased  due to reduced pricing and increased competition 
animal health product sales were  a decrease of from sales of organo arsenical feed additives  the largest product in feed additives  was down from due to escalated grain prices and increased price competition to end users 
agricultural intermediate sales of  increased  from the increase was due to the renegotiation of a contract for a pyridine derivative used in the manufacture of herbicides in the first quarter however  pyridine  which is the largest product in crop protection  was down from  due to a major customer purchasing at levels after two years and at above contract levels 
the specialty business segment was  an increase of  from this segment includes performance enhancing chemical sales of  up  from and polymer system sales of  down  from performance enhancing chemical sales increased  over the key increases were pyridine derivatives shipments to world markets and customers not previously served  and gain in market share of pnba  a pigment used in dyes and uv protection agents

a settlement had been agreed upon that entitles the company to payments in and for the next three years 
accordingly  the company recognized income  net of related costs  of approximately  during total gross profit in increased to  resulting in a higher gross margin percentage of of gross sales compared with in the gross margin increase was due to an improved product mix of sales  production efficiencies  and increased plant throughput  in line with management s continued focus on higher performing  more profitable product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in  down from in the expense of  was  below primarily due to lower legal and environment costs 
such reductions are the result of recoveries from third parties and reserve reversals that exceeded our outlays related to remediation programs in the company conducts periodic reviews of its environmental and litigation matters  prepares estimates of the range of potential future costs of each matter wherever possible  and adjusts the accruals for environmental contingencies as circumstances warrant 
in  this accrual was reduced by  to reflect the company s remaining estimated exposure 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  and represented a increase from a portion of this increase was due to costs associated with the oxford asymmetry contract of  the operating profit in increased to  from  in due to the improved gross margins and the aforementioned reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses 
net interest expense of  in reflected a decrease of  from the decrease was due to strong cash flow and to the decreased outstanding debt as a result of the equity offering in mid the interest rate in was compared to in dollars in thousands  except share data other income in was compared with other expense of  in the difference included foreign currency transaction gains versus currency losses in the provision for income taxes for resulted in an effective rate of versus in the company recorded a  reversal of tax reserves as a result of a settlement with the internal revenue service related to audits for the years through during january  the company implemented tax strategies which  based upon projected domestic and international taxable income  should have a favorable impact on the effective tax rate for and beyond 
however  actual results could differ in the event of changes in tax regulations or deviations in projections 
the company s net income increased to  compared with a net income of  in primarily due to increased margins and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses and interest 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the increase in cash flow is primarily due to increased revenues  as well as increased current liabilities and income taxes payable 
cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures of  the acquisition of the chiragene facility and the acquisition of boehringer ingelheim bioproduct partnership bibp

plant upgrades included an office relocation and expansion at nordic which allowed several locations to be combined and the purchase of additional land adjacent to profarmaco 
on september   the company entered into a new five year credit agreement the agreement with a bank group headed by the chase manhattan bank as administrative agent and the first national bank of chicago as documentation agent 
the bank group has a total of domestic banks and international banks 
the agreement provides the company with a  borrowing facility 
the new agreement replaces the previously existing revolving credit agreement with nbd bank  na under this agreement  the company has pledged of the common stock of the company s foreign subsidiaries as collateral 
the agreement permits the company to choose between various interest rate options 
under the agreement  the interest rate options available to the company are a us prime rate or b libor plus the applicable margin ranging from 
to 
or c competitive bid at a libor rate borrowing or a fixed rate borrowing to be determined by auction 
the applicable margin is adjusted based upon the funded indebtedness to cash flow ratio of the company 
additionally  the company pays a commitment fee of between 
to 
on the entire portion of the agreement 
on september   the company utilized  of the agreement in order to repay the then outstanding balance under the previously existing revolving credit agreement 
on september   the company borrowed  to finance the acquisition of the outstanding common stock of biowhittaker 
of this amount   was utilized on september  to acquire the of biowhittaker shares which had been tendered at that date 
the company subsequently utilized the remaining portion to finance the acquisition of the remaining of biowhittaker on october  the undrawn borrowing availability under the agreement as of december  and was  and  respectively 
there is  outstanding as of december  management is dollars in thousands  except share data of the opinion that these amounts  together with cash flows from operations  are adequate for meeting the company s operating  financing and capital requirements 
effective may   the company s board of directors approved a two for one split of the company s common stock  par value  in the form of one additional share of common stock for each share held 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  deutsche mark and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts and has used put and call options contracts in the past to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the net notional amount of these contracts is  which the company estimates to be approximately of the foreign currency exposure during the period covered resulting in an unrealized currency loss of at december  given the unlikely scenario that the collections match the forecast  and that all the collections move against their local currencies  no more than  of pre tax profits for a twelve month period would be at risk 
this is based on a non hedged risk of  this residual risk allows for an over forecasting margin of error and prevents over hedging of actual operating risk 
as of december   the combined non local currency forecasted net collections amounted to  offsetting this exposure are the expected  us dollar intercompany payments from the combined european sites 
the remaining  forecasted exposure was partially hedged  with major banks through interest rate swaps to reduce the non hedged risk to  interest rate management the company s debt outstanding  and the interest paid to support the debt  has been relatively flat over the past year 
each of the interest rate options contained in the revolving credit agreement includes floating rates 
this arrangement has the advantage of making lower interest rates available in a declining market  however it also exposes the company to any upward swings in interest rates 
for example  based on the company s current level of debt outstanding  an interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and thus decrease the company s after tax profitability by the company has employed a plan to control interest rate risk 
the plan allows the company to pay a premium now in order to obtain a fixed interest rate at predetermined cost in the future 
in effect  the premium  or swap  stabilizes interest costs by converting unpredictable variable interest rates to fixed rates 
the swap market is currently offering fixed rates for the next two to five years at a small premium  between 
and  over the current libor rate 
as of december   the company has seven interest rate swaps in place that total  at an average rate of  with maturities through the year the company s strategy is to cover approximately of outstanding bank debt with interest rate protection 
dollars in thousands  except share data impact of the euro the advent of the euro may have a slight impact on the transactions of the company s italian subsidiary  profarmaco 
the euro has mitigated any exposure on the transactions among the company s subsidiaries in germany and france 
the activities of nordic and seal sands will not be impacted since the england and sweden are not part of the european monetary union at present 
overall  the euro should not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company is a party to several environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the company had accruals  included in current accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities  of  and  at december  and  respectively  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and the company s current and former operating sites for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company s accrual represents of what it believes are the reasonably possible environmental cleanup related costs of a non capital nature 
the estimate of reasonably possible costs is less certain than the probable estimate on which the accrual is based 
during the past three year period  cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters were  and for  and  respectively 
there were no provisions for environmental contingencies during the past three year period 
the company reduced reserves of approximately and  in and  respectively  as a result of revised estimates 
after reviewing information currently available  management believes any amounts paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from the estimates could have a material adverse effect on financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
litigation the company and its subsidiary profarmaco srl profarmaco were named as defendants in a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission ftc on december   in the united states district court for the district of columbia 
the complaint alleges that exclusive license agreements which profarmaco entered into with mylan laboratories  inc mylan covering the drug master files for and therefore the right to buy and use two active pharmaceutical ingredients apis  lorazepam and clorazepate  were part of an effort on mylan s part to restrict competition in the supply of lorazepam and clorazepate and to increase the price charged for these products when mylan sold them as generic pharmaceuticals 
the complaint further alleges that these agreements violate the federal trade commission act  and that mylan  cambrex  profarmaco  and gyma laboratories of america  inc  profarmaco s distributor in the united states  engaged in an unlawful restraint of trade and conspired to monopolize and attempted to monopolize the markets for the generic pharmaceuticals incorporating the apis 
the ftc seeks a permanent injunction and other relief  including disgorgement of the profits generated through the licensing arrangements  which the ftc alleges to be in excess of  for all defendants 
in accordance with the license agreement  the company received royalties of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a lawsuit making similar allegations against the company and profarmaco  and seeking injunctive relief and treble damages  has been filed by the attorneys general of states and the district of columbia in the united states district court for the district of columbia on behalf of those states and persons in those states who were purchasers of the generic pharmaceuticals 
the company and profarmaco have also been named in purported class action complaints brought by private plaintiffs in various state courts on behalf of purchasers of dollars in thousands  except share data lorazepam and clorazepate in generic form  making allegations essentially similar to those raised in the ftc s complaint and seeking various forms of relief including treble damages 
the company believes that its licensing arrangements with mylan are in accordance with regulatory requirements and will vigorously defend the ftc s actions and various other lawsuits and class actions 
however  the company and mylan have terminated the exclusive licenses to the drug master files 
the future royalty arrangements under the agreements have concluded as of december  in entering these licensing arrangements  the company elected not to raise the price of its products and had no control or influence over the pricing of the final generic product forms by mylan 
on may   the company s nepera subsidiary  a manufacturer and seller of niacinamide vitamin b  received a federal grand jury subpoena for the production of documents relating to the pricing and possible customer allocation with regard to that product 
the company understands that the subpoena was issued as part of the federal government s ongoing antitrust investigation into various business practices in the vitamin industry generally 
the company and nepera have been cooperating fully with the government s investigation 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the ftc action and various other lawsuits and class actions  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings should not have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
these matters if resolved in an unfavorable manner could have a material adverse affect on the operating results or cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period

dollars in thousands  except share data year update the ability of computers  software or any equipment utilizing micro processors to properly recognize and process data information at the turn of the century is commonly referred to as a year yk compliance issue 
to minimize the risk of unplanned interruptions  the company is using a multi step approach in conducting its year project 
these steps are inventory  assessment  remediation  testing for compliance  and contingency planning 
the company approaches its yk compliance issue by categorizing its dependencies into two sections internal systems information technology it systems and non it systems  and external systems of suppliers and customers 
generally  internal systems identified as non yk compliant are being replaced or modified 
many of the internal non compliant systems were targeted for replacement for reasons other than yk issues as the benefits of newer technology had already created an economic business case for action 
replacement solution costs will be capitalized as permitted by applicable accounting standards whereas the cost of modification solutions will generally be expensed as repairs 
external systems are being monitored with the cooperation of our suppliers and customers 
internal systems a it systems these systems include internal applications software such as finance  manufacturing purchasing  product costing  production reporting  maintenance  and planning and scheduling  logistics distribution planning and customer order entry  human resources  and communications 
all internal it systems have been inventoried  assessed  and remediated where necessary for yk compliance and are now being tested 
the company anticipates its internal it will be yk compliant by the end of b non it systems these systems are used for process monitoring and control  laboratory measurement and analysis  waste treatment control  and in other plant operations 
these systems include embedded chip technology such as programmable logic controllers and related hardware software  and personal computers and related software 
all internal non it systems have been inventoried and assessed for yk compliance and those which require modification are being remediated 
this remediation  or where necessary replacement  will be completed by mid testing will be completed on all systems by the end of the third quarter external systems external systems include systems of customers and suppliers 
the company is in the process of understanding the extent to which it is vulnerable to the yk issues of its customers and suppliers 
the company has identified and contacted third parties whose systems would have a significant negative impact on operations if not yk compliant  and is in the process of assessing the systems of these third parties 
the company expects to complete its assessment and to have developed requisite action plans with respect to these findings by mid the company will also develop contingency plans during the third and fourth quarters of for all critical systems and key suppliers in the event an internal or external system  that is believed to be compliant  fails 
the dates on which the company plans to complete any necessary yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
the company believes its most reasonably likely worst case scenario in the event of the failure to correct a material yk compliance problem  internal or external  could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
while management is not aware of such problems  such failures  if they occur  could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the company believes that dollars in thousands  except share data with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the yk project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced 
the estimated total cost of implementing yk solutions  which includes the cost of the replacement systems discussed above  is approximately  the approximate amount expended through december was  with an additional spending of approximately  occurring in with regard to the  expended through  approximately has been expensed and  capitalized in accordance with applicable accounting standards
