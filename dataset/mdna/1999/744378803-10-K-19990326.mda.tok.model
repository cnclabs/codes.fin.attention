the company has investments in various domestic and foreign debt securities which mature between the year and these investments had a market value of over  at december  substantially all of these investments are denominated in us dollars at fixed rates of interest 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate to decreases and increases in market value of those debt instruments

in addition  these instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the instruments  and other general market conditions 
interest rates on lines of credit are variable  based upon prime or libor rates 
outstanding borrowings at december  were not significant

one of the company s us based operations enters into foreign currency exchange contracts with banks in order to fix its trade payables denominated in foreign currency
