the company s principal business is to design  develop  market and distribute stuffed toys  novelty items  and sculpted toy pillows based on licensed characters and trademarks 
the company also designs  develops  markets and distributes electronic toys and non licensed stuffed toys 
the company sells these products to customers in the amusement and retail markets 
the company s toy operations accounted for of net sales for fiscal approximately  coin operated amusement game machines operated by the company s vending division provide the remaining of net sales 
net sales derived from vending operations as a percentage of net sales have declined in recent periods as the company has emphasized its toy operations  and the company anticipates that such trend will continue 
based on the current weakness in the domestic traditional retail toy market  the company does not expect the growth in the retail division s sales to continue at rates as rapid as it has experienced in the past years 
the company has divested and acquired several entities in its history 
in each case  management evaluates the strategic role of each entity relative to its overall long term business plan 
management also estimates future return versus the current market value of such entities to determine if divesting or acquiring a business makes economic sense at any given time 
in march  the company sold restaurants universal  its european subsidiary to an unrelated third party  for approximately million 
the outstanding balance of the non performing note receivable in the amount of  due from the purchaser of the restaurants was fully reserved for in the fourth quarter of fiscal by the company due to the purchaser s failure to remit the required payments on the note and the filing by the company of a lawsuit against the purchaser to enforce collection 
in june  the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets  business operations and facilities of ace 
the purchase price  paid principally with cash and debt  was approximately million and was accounted for using the purchase method 
in november  the company  through play by play europe  acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of tlc based in doncaster  england for  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
in march  the company through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired certain assets and liabilities of caribe marketing and sales co  inc caribe for the purchase price of million consisting of cash   shares of the company s common stock  and the assumption of a sellers note 
the company believes that caribe provides the company with a new base for its latin american operations and enhances the company s marketing and distribution capabilities within the market 
net toy sales to amusement customers accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal the company sells both licensed and non licensed products to its amusement customers for use principally as redemption prizes 
net toy sales to retail customers accounted for of the company s net sales for fiscal since the beginning of fiscal  the company has expanded its product offering of licensed stuffed toys through the addition of several licensed characters and trademarks 
prior to fiscal  substantially all of the company s sales to retail customers involved licensed products 
sales to amusement customers generally provide a higher gross margin than do sales to retail customers 
among the amusement sales  licensed products typically provide a higher gross margin than do non licensed products 
retailers typically buy in higher volumes  therefore they demand lower margins 
however  retail sales of television promoted products generally result in higher gross margins than non promoted items  but also require higher associated advertising costs  which are reported as a component of selling  general and administrative costs 
the company spent approximately million on media advertising for certain retail products during fiscal the company began its international toy operations with the opening of its distribution facility in spain in august since that time and with the acquisition of tlc in the uk  the company has experienced significant sales growth in its international operations  particularly in western europe 
the company anticipates continued international sales growth in both the amusement and retail markets  particularly with respect to licensed products 
non licensed products are comparable in both the united states and europe  licensed products might be sold worldwide or only in some markets  depending on local tastes and licensing restrictions 
the company s european toy sales have historically resulted in higher gross margins than domestic toy sales  however  the company believes this trend will change as the large retailers continue to quickly gain market share 
most of the company s international toy sales are made in european countries by play by play europe  sa located in valencia  spain and by play by play uk ltd 
located in doncaster  england 
to date  the cost of most direct shipment sales from third party manufacturers to international customers has been borne by play by play europe and have been denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the shipment date until receipt of payment 
substantially all other sales by such subsidiaries are transacted in spanish pesetas or british pounds  their functional currencies  and therefore any gain or loss on currency translation is reported as a component of shareholders equity on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company faces similar risk on inventory purchases from third party manufacturers by the company s european subsidiaries 
these transactions are also denominated in united states dollars so foreign currency risk exists from the time that the subsidiaries are notified of the shipment until payment is made 
some of the company s license agreements require royalty payments in canadian dollars 
likewise  some of play by play europe s license agreements require payments in united states dollars 
as a result  the company experiences currency risk to the extent that exchange rates fluctuate from the date the royalty liability or minimum guarantee is incurred until the date the royalty is actually paid to the licensor 
additionally  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk for intercompany receivable and payable transactions through the settlement date 
historically  no attempt has been made to minimize  by means of hedging or derivatives  the risk of potential currency fluctuations  since the currency risk has not been significant to the company on a consolidated basis 
the company experienced significant growth in net sales and net income during and due in part to the ace and tlc acquisitions  which occurred in june and november  respectively  of accordingly  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful and results of operations from prior periods may not be indicative of future results

the company is required to pay the remaining advances or royalties due under the license agreements irrespective of the provisions recorded by the company  and may result in the payment of significant royalty amounts for which no product sales have occurred 
the company satisfies its capital requirements and seasonal working capital needs with cash flow primarily from borrowings and secondarily from operations 
the company s primary capital needs have consisted of funding for acquisitions  purchases of inventory  customer receivables  letters of credit  licenses and international expansion 
effective july   the company amended its million credit facility which expired on july   the amendment effectively extended the maturity date until october  and waived all existing defaults 
in connection with the amendment  the senior lender exercised certain blockage rights preventing the company from making any principal or interest payments to subordinated debtors  including the company s convertible subordinated notes 
as of july   borrowings outstanding under the million credit facility included a balance of approximately million outstanding on the revolving line of credit and million on the related term loan  as well as an aggregate of million in outstanding irrevocable letters of credit in support of inventory purchases 
on october   the company entered into a new million credit facility which replaced the company s million credit facility 
the new credit facility has an initial three year term but may be extended an additional year 
the new credit facility includes a million revolving line of credit commitment  subject to availability under a borrowing base calculated by reference to the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  and a million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit 
the new credit facility also includes two term loans totaling million 
interest on borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit and the term loans is payable monthly at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  i the lender s prime rate plus percent or ii the lender s adjusted euro dollar rate plus 
the new credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of the company s domestic assets  and of the issued and outstanding stock of its foreign subsidiaries 
based on the level of the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventory at october   the company had million of additional borrowing capacity available under the new credit facility  all of which could be used to support borrowings under the revolving line of credit or additional letters of credit 
the new credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants and conditions among which are a prohibition on the payment of dividends  limitations on further indebtedness  restrictions on dispositions and acquisitions of assets  limitations on advances to third parties and foreign subsidiaries and compliance with certain financial covenants 
in addition  the new credit facility prohibits the company s chief executive officer from reducing his ownership in the company below specified levels 
see footnote restructuring and refinancing of notes payable and long term debt the company had entered into a convertible loan agreement convertible loan agreement dated july   pursuant to which the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes 
in march  the company defaulted under certain financial covenants of the convertible loan agreement  and in july the company defaulted in the payment of interest due on the convertible subordinated notes as required by the senior lenders 
on october   the company and the holders of the convertible subordinated notes entered into a first amendment to the convertible loan agreement the first amendment which waived existing defaults under the convertible loan agreement  provided consent to the new credit facility  and modified the financial covenants in the convertible loan agreement to conform to the financial covenants in the new credit facility 
in addition  the first amendment increased the interest rate from to per annum  changed the convertible debentures final maturity date from june  to december   and adjusted the conversion price from per share of common stock to the lesser of i per share and ii the greater of per share or the average closing price of the company s common stock for the days following october  in connection with the first amendment  the company granted the holders of the convertible subordinated debentures a first lien on its interest in its los angeles warehouse and a second lien on substantially all its other assets 
the first amendment also includes limitations on the issuance of stock options to employees  and entitles the holders to two advisory board positions 
the first amendment also provide for permanent board seats  as well as limitation on the total number of board seats and a possible reset of the conversion price if the outstanding debentures have not been converted or paid in full by final maturity 
principal payments on the company s outstanding convertible debentures commence in june  and the convertible debentures mature on december  the company currently expects that  by itself  cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet these debt service obligations under the convertible debentures 
accordingly  unless earlier converted to the company s common stock  the company will need to refinance in order to satisfy its repayment obligations thereunder 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to refinance the convertible debentures or  if such refinancing is obtained  that the terms will be as favorable to the company as these contained in the convertible debentures 
the company has borrowed substantially all of its available capacity under its new credit facility 
thus  any future losses or other capital needs could require the company to seek additional financing from public or private issuances of debt and or equity or from asset sales 
the company may not be able to complete any such financing or asset sale at all or  if so  on terms favorable to the company 
any equity financing could result in dilution to existing shareholders 
see risk factors leverage and future debt service and capital needs as of july   play by play europe had an aggregate of approximately million outstanding in irrevocable letters of credit in support of inventory purchases 
the company s current policy is to permanently reinvest all earnings from foreign subsidiaries in those operations 
this policy restricts the amount of cash available for distribution by these subsidiaries  however  the company may obtain cash from the subsidiaries for repayment of intercompany obligations incurred in the normal course of business 
in the event the company changes its policy  a tax liability will be incurred for previous undistributed earnings  and any distributions would be subject to withholding and current income taxes

the cash flow from operations for fiscal was primarily affected by the net loss 
the cash flow from operations for fiscal was primarily affected by changes in accounts receivable as a result of the increase in sales experienced by the company  as well as inventory which increased in part due to the increase in sales as well as to support the expansion in the european market

during fiscal  the company repaid million of net borrowings on the revolving line of credit under the credit facility and repaid million principal on the term loan 
the company believes that its current available cash  net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through july   however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional borrowings to meet its working capital needs  or that if obtained  it will be on terms at least as favorable as those existing credit facilities 
euro 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union introduced the euro  which became the common currency among the participating member countries 
the participating members sovereign currency converted to the euro at the exchange rates in effect on the introduction date 
spain is one of the participating members  which is the country in which play by play europe is located 
play by play europe intends to keep its books in spain s sovereign currency  the peseta  through the substantial portion of the three year introductory period  at the end of which all companies in participating member countries must adopt the euro 
as play by play europe s accounting system is currently capable of performing the euro conversion  the company does not anticipate that the costs related to the conversion will be significant 
in addition  as play by play europe operates primarily in spain and in other non european union countries  the introduction of the euro will not have a material effect on play by play europe s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows for the forseeable future 
dividend policy 
the company has never paid any cash dividends 
for the foreseeable future  the company expects to retain earnings to finance the expansion and development of its business 
any future payment of cash dividends will be within the discretion of the company s board of directors  and will depend on  among other factors  the earnings  capital requirements  operating and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors  and compliance with various financing covenants such as those contained in the agreements relative to the credit facilities to which the company is or may become a party 
year similar to many business entities  the company may be impacted by the inability of computer application software programs to distinguish between the year and due to a commonly used programming convention 
until such programs are modified or replaced prior to  calculations and interpretations based on date based arithmetic or logical operations performed by such programs may be incorrect 
management s plan addressing the impact on the company of the year issue focuses on application systems  process control systems embedded chips  technology infrastructure  and third party business partners and suppliers with which the company has significant relationships 
the plan is comprised of five phases developing an inventory of hardware  software and embedded chips  assessing the degree to which each area is currently in compliance with year requirements  performing renovations and repairs as needed to attain compliance  testing to ensure compliance  and developing a contingency plan if repair and renovation efforts are either unsuccessful or untimely 
management has completed steps   and of this plan 
steps and were in process at the balance sheet date  and subsequent to that date  have been substantially completed 
the company feels that all phases will be completed by the end of calendar costs incurred to date have primarily consisted of labor from the redeployment of existing information technology  legal and operational resources as well as computer hardware and software costs 
the company has budgeted approximately million for these year compliance efforts  and management feels that actual final costs will not materially deviate from this 
however  the company s year program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various aspects of the program are subject to change 
the company is currently replacing its financial and core business system software with a new oracle enterprise resource planning system designed to enhance management information  financial reporting  inventory management  order entry  purchasing and has the added benefit of addressing the year issues 
the new enterprise system has necessitated enhancement of the company s existing computer networks and desktop applications 
the company does not presently anticipate a material business interruption as a result of the year due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s current and planned activities with respect to the year problem are expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material customers and suppliers 
the company believes that  with the implementation of the new enterprise systems and completion of the planned activities as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be minimal 
management believes that its customers and suppliers would also receive advance notice of any material year compliance problems  allowing them to implement alternate plans  if necessary 
seasonality both the retail and amusement toy industries are inherently seasonal 
generally  in the past  the company s sales to the amusement industry have been highest during the third and fourth fiscal quarters  and collections for those sales have been highest during the succeeding two fiscal quarters 
the company s sales to the retail toy industry have been highest during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  and collections from those sales have been highest during the succeeding two fiscal quarters 
the company s working capital needs and borrowings to fund those needs have been highest during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
as a result of the company s increased sales to amusement customers and to retail customers  the company anticipates that its borrowings to fund working capital needs may become more significant in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company utilizes borrowings under its credit facility to finance purchases of inventory and accounts receivable  primarily during peak selling periods 
during fiscal  the highest level of aggregate borrowings under the credit facility was million in may the following sets forth the company s net sales by fiscal quarter for fiscal  and fiscal year fiscal quarter in thousands first    second    third    fourth    inflation the company does not believe that inflation in the united states or europe in recent years has had a significant effect on its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  august   for the company 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives which meet the definition of a hedge transaction are recorded each period in the either earnings or other comprehensive income 
the company believes that the impact of the pronouncement will be minimal  as historically  the company has not entered into any derivative or hedging transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates ie prime rate or libor  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states us dollar and functional currencies of its subsidiaries ie british pound spanish peseta 
in addition  the company is exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or are likely to experience an economic downturn  such as china and latin america 
the company purchases substantially all of its inventory from companies in china  therefore  the company is subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
company believes if such as event were to occur  it would be able to find alternate sources of inventory at competitive prices  however  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful 
historically and as of july   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize its market risk 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit and term loan under the old credit facility was variable based on libor or the bank s alternate base rate 
the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit and term loans under the new credit facility entered into on october  is variable based on the lender s prime rate or adjusted eurodollar rate  and therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at july   approximately million was outstanding under the old credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of 
foreign currency risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries in valencia  spain and doncaster  england 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in spanish pesetas or british pounds  respectively  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the spanish pesetas us dollars exchange rate and british pounds us dollars exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the spanish peseta or the british pound 
purchases of inventory by the company s european subsidiaries from its suppliers in the far east are subject to currency risk to the extent that there are fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the spanish peseta or the british pound 
certain of the european subsidiaries license agreements call for payment of royalties in a currency different from their functional currency  and these arrangements subject the company to currency risk to the extent that exchange rates fluctuate from the date that royalty liabilities are incurred until the date royalties are actually paid to the licensor
