these companies  as well as industry experts  have identified the following factors as contributors to this slowdown in the buying market 
significant financial commitments devoted to year readiness  which have led to limited discretionary financial resources available for the purchase of software products such as the company s 

weakness in the overall global economy  which has affected certain customers businesses and their buying tendencies 

public announcements by large enterprise resource planning erp software vendors regarding plans for introduction of new products within the company s target markets which have led to confusion and indecision by prospective buyers 
the company believes these factors  as well as possible others  have to some degree contributed to the company s reduced revenues in fiscal  particularly in the area of software license fees 
years ended april  and revenues the company s total revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended april  from the prior year of million in the fiscal year ended april  this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in implementation and training services as well as an overall rise in maintenance revenues

international revenues represented approximately and of total revenues in the years ended april  and  respectively 
software licenses 
the company s license fee revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended april  to million compared to million in the prior year

maintenance revenues  which consist of product support activities and on going product enhancements provided to customers who license the company s products and purchase maintenance agreements  increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  respectively

maintenance revenues constituted and of total revenues in fiscal year ended april  and fiscal year ended april   respectively 
gross margin total gross margin in fiscal was compared to a year ago 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease of license fee margin from in fiscal compared to in fiscal as a result of lower license fee sales and higher capitalized software amortization expense during fiscal in addition  the services gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year due mainly to the switch from higher margin services work related to the year remediation work performed in fiscal year to lower margin services work being performed in fiscal maintenance gross margin decreased to for fiscal when compared to in the same period a year ago 
this reduction was due to slower than anticipated growth in maintenance revenue during fiscal combined with additional support efforts related to newer products introduced during the year the cost of revenues for license fees are expected to increase during the year ending april  from fiscal year due to an expected increase in amortization expense from certain capitalized computer software projects that are expected to become generally available during the year 
the company will monitor the market acceptance of these newly released products

income taxes 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal year was of pretax income compared to in fiscal year this increase was due to the fact that the company experienced a net loss in the quarter ended july  and did not record a deferred tax asset for the net operating loss carryforward 
the effective tax rate was therefore lowered in subsequent quarters of fiscal as the company was profitable 
operating pattern the company experiences an irregular pattern of quarterly operating results  caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software license contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities provided cash of approximately million in the year ended april   compared to approximately million in the same period of the prior year 
the activities of that portfolio are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the cash provided by operations during the year ended april   was primarily attributable to a non cash charge for asset impairment and purchased r d of million  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  proceeds from the sale of trading securities of million  proceeds from the maturities of trading securities of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses of million

cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended april  and  respectively 
the majority of the cash was used for purchases of held to maturities investments  purchase of majority interest in subsidiaries  computer software development costs and property and equipment  offset by sales of held to maturity securities 
cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was approximately million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal year the decrease from the prior year was due primarily to an increase in use of cash for the repurchase of the company s common stock in fiscal year in the amount of million  and the cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year was due primarily from the issuance of common stock by logility  inc  a subsidiary of the company 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable were and days as of april  and april   respectively 
this decrease was due to improved collection efforts by the company 
the company s current ratio was to and cash and investments totaled of total assets at april  compared to a current ratio of to and cash and investments totaling of total assets at april  the company expects existing cash and investments  combined with cash generated from operations  to be sufficient to meet its operational needs in fiscal the company may seek additional sources of capital to meet its growth objectives in the future 
to the extent that such amounts are insufficient to finance the company s capital requirements  the company will be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing 
the company does not currently have a bank line of credit 
no assurance can be given that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
if available  such financing may result in further dilution to the company s shareholders and higher interest expense 
on december   american software  inc s board of directors approved a resolution authorizing the company to repurchase up to million shares of the company s class a common stock 
on march   american software  inc s board of directors approved a resolution authorizing the company to repurchase an additional  shares for a total of up to million shares of the company s class a common stock 
this repurchase will be through open market purchases at prevailing market prices 
the timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions  the market price of the company s common stock and management s assessment of the company s liquidity and cash flow needs 
since these resolutions  the company has repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately million as of april  year readiness disclosure products based on management s assessment  the company believes that the current versions of its software products are year compliant 
however  the company believes some of its customers may be running earlier versions of the company s products that are not year compliant  and the company has been encouraging such customers to migrate to current product versions 
the company offers its customers the alternatives of implementing a modification to non compliant legacy versions of its software or migrating to a later version of the software which is year compliant 
moreover  the company s products are generally integrated into other systems involving complex software products developed by other vendors 
year problems inherent in a customer s other software programs might significantly limit that customer s ability to utilize the company s products 
software products as complex as those offered by the company might contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when new versions are released  including products believed to be year compliant 
while the company believes that it has assessed  corrected and tested its products to address the year issue  there can be no assurances that the company s software products contain or will contain all necessary date code changes or that errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commercial release  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
in addition  the company might experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the continued successful development and release of products that are year compliant or that meet the year requirements of customers 
if the company is unable or is delayed in its efforts to make the necessary date code changes  there could be a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in its own  as well as in others products  and issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although the company has not been a party to any litigation involving its products or services related to year compliance issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings  or otherwise address claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company believes that year issues have affected and may continue to affect the purchasing decisions of customers and potential customers of the company s products 
many businesses are expending significant resources on projects to make their current hardware and software systems year compliant 
such expenditures may result in reduced funding for projects to purchase software products such as those offered by the company 
potential customers may also choose to defer purchasing year compliant products until they believe it is absolutely necessary  thus resulting in potentially stalled market sales within the industry 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
internal systems the company is working to identify and remediate all internal systems which may impact the operations of the company 
the cost of converting the company s internal systems is not expected to be material since the company is utilizing internal resources to meet its year readiness needs 
the company has completed of its system evaluation and of its remediation 
the company estimates the completion of its remediation and testing by august  the company utilizes third party vendor equipment  telecommunication products and software products that may or may not be year compliant 
the company has been communicating with such third party vendors about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem  and the company has requested assurances that such equipment  product and services will be year compliant 
the company has received such assurances from most of the third party vendors and is waiting to receive such assurances from the remaining vendors 
in the event that such additional assurances are not timely received  the company will switch to another vendor or take such other action as the company shall deem appropriate 
although the company is currently taking steps to address the impact of the year compliance issue surrounding such third party products  failure of any critical technology components to be year compliant may have an adverse impact on business operations or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
the company s evaluation of year issues includes the development of contingency plans for business functions that are susceptible to a substantive risk of disruption resulting from a year related event 
because the company has not yet identified any business function that is materially at risk of the year related disruption  it has not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year events for any business function 
the company is prepared for the possibility  however  that certain business functions may be hereafter identified as at risk and will develop contingency plans for such business functions when and if such determinations are made 
forward looking statements contained in this year compliance discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosure under the heading of forward looking statements  below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency 
in the year ended april   the company generated of its revenues outside the united states 
international sales usually are made by the company s foreign subsidiaries and are denominated typically in us dollars or british pounds sterling 
however  the expense incurred by foreign subsidiaries is denominated in the local currencies 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in fiscal was not material 
interest rates 
the company manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio of available for sale instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  money market instruments  bank time deposits  and taxable and tax advantaged variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and national  state  and local government agencies  in accordance with an investment policy approved by the company s board of directors 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair value of securities at april  was approximately million 
interest income on the company s investments is carried in other income expense 
the company also holds cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states and foreign countries 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term time deposits of the local bank 
such operating cash balances held at banks outside the united states are denominated in the local currency 
many of the company s investments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
when interest rates fall  the company s income from investments in variable rate securities declines 
when interest rates rise  the fair market value of the company s investments in fixed rate securities 
in addition  the company s equity securities are subject to stock market volatility 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate risk by holding fixed rate securities to maturity  but should its liquidity needs force it to sell fixed rate securities prior to maturity  the company may experience a loss of principal 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement will be effective for the company beginning june  the new statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes accounting treatment for three types of hedges hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments  hedges of the variable cash flows of forecasted transactions  and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations 
the company has not invested in derivative instruments nor participated in hedging activities and therefore does not anticipate there will be a material impact on the results of operations or financial position from statement no 
in december  the aicpa issued sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
this sop amends sop no 
to  among other matters  require recognition of revenue using the residual method in circumstances outlined in the sop 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized as follows the total fair value of undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of sop no 
and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
sop no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after march  the company does not believe that the adoption of sop no 
will have a material effect on its revenue recognition 
forward looking statements it should be noted that the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements  which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made herein 
the timing of releases of the company s software products can be affected by client needs  marketplace demands and technological advances 
development plans frequently change  and it is difficult to predict with accuracy the release dates for products in development 
in addition  other factors  including changes in general economic conditions  the growth rate of the market for the company s products and services  the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services  the effect of competitive products and pricing  and the irregular pattern of revenues  as well as a number of other risk factors which could affect the future performance of the company
