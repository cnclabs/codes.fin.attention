net revenues increased to approximately million for the year ended july   an increase of million or from the prior year 
revenues substantially increased in the knitted fabric line  yarn processing line and wink davis

yarn processing revenues totaled million  the line began operations in the current fiscal year 
wink davis  which had twelve months operations in the current year as compared to only eleven in the prior year  had increased revenues of million 
these increases were offset by decreased revenues of hosiery equipment 
hosiery revenues decreased by approximately million  primarily due to lower demand for open toe equipment 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased unfavorably to of revenues for the current fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the increase is due to generally lower margins on hosiery and yarn processing equipment 
hosiery margins decreased due to lower demand for the open toe equipment being sold by the company in fiscal many customers delayed major purchases of new equipment in anticipation of new closed toe technology 
this technology was actually introduced early in fiscal gross margins on yarn processing equipment were also generally lower than the company s historical product lines 
these yarn processing sales were on backorder at the time speizman assumed operations 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by  or to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is primarily due to additional sales expenses of yarn processing equipment  which began operations in august and  to a lesser extent  sales expenses of tmc

general and administrative

one significant reason for the increase is inclusion of a full year s operations for the company s subsidiaries 
tmc had twelve months operations in fiscal as compared to only four months of fiscal similarly  speizman yarn commenced operations beginning on august  in the current fiscal year 
other increases were due to higher salary expenses and bad debts offset partially by no bonuses for fiscal interest expense

seasonality and other factors there are certain seasonal factors that may affect the company s business 
traditionally  manufacturing businesses in italy close for the month of august  and the company s domestic hosiery customers close for one week in july 
consequently  no shipments or deliveries  as the case may be  of machines distributed by the company that are manufactured in italy are made during these periods which fall in the company s first quarter 
in addition  manufacturing businesses in italy generally close for two weeks in december  during the company s second quarter 
fluctuations of customer orders or other factors may result in quarterly variations in net revenues from year to year 
effects of inflation and changing prices management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
disclosure about foreign currency risk generally  the company s purchases of foreign manufactured machinery for resale are denominated in italian lira 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements between the italian lira and the us dollar from the time of placing the company s purchase order until final payment for the purchase is made 
the contracts have maturity dates that do not generally exceed months 
substantially all of the increase or decrease of the lira denominated purchase price is offset by the gains and losses of the foreign exchange contract 
the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the results of operations in the period in which the hedged transaction is consummated 
a substantial portion of the company s textile machine and spare part purchases are denominated and payable in italian lira 
currency fluctuations of the lira could result in substantial price level changes and therefore impede or promote import export sales and substantially impact profits 
however  to reduce exposure to adverse foreign currency fluctuations during the period from customer orders to payment for goods sold  the company enters into forward exchange contracts 
the company is not able to assess the quantitative effect that such currency fluctuations could have upon the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a significant adverse effect on future operations 
at july   the company had contracts maturing through june to purchase approximately billion lira for approximately million  which approximates the spot rate on that date 
year compliance many computer systems and other electronic equipment with embedded microprocessors were designed to recognize only the last two digits of the year 
with the arrival of the year yk  these systems and microprocessors may encounter operating problems due to their inability to distinguish years after from years preceding as a result  the company has been identifying  rectifying or replacing computer systems or other electronic component that are not yk compliant 
examples of equipment the company has been analyzing include its primary accounting system  other information systems and various support equipment  the products distributed by the company and other products and services procured by the company 
the company has reviewed its primary information system 
in the fall of the company upgraded this system by increasing two digit date fields to four digits 
costs incurred in this project were not significant 
presently  all subsidiaries wink davis  tmc and speizman yarn and speizman industries use this system for all primary accounting functions 
all known issues in the primary accounting system relating to yk have been resolved 
in the spring of wink davis was converted to this information system from their previous system which was not yk compliant 
at the time of the purchase of wink davis on august   management planned to integrate wink davis information system into the existing system used by speizman industries 
this integration project  which was not accelerated due to the yk issue  cost approximately  these costs were expensed in fiscal the company does use various other information systems and electronic support equipment such as telephone and voice mail systems  computer programs and computer equipment 
the company is currently in the process of making these non critical systems yk compliant and the company anticipates that this will be done by the end of november these systems will be upgraded through a combination of modifications done by company staff and various software patches from major vendors of telecommunications equipment 
costs incurred in these projects are not expected to be significant 
a substantial portion of the equipment distributed by the company has computerized controls and features 
however  to the company s knowledge  no operating features are dependent on time or date functions 
additionally  the company has received similar assurances from its major suppliers 
the company is reliant on material vendors  suppliers and customers to ensure that the company for a number of critical operations 
we are unable to control the actions of others with respect to their year compliance 
however  our material suppliers and service providers are large companies within their industries and have much at stake in ensuring their own compliance 
we have questioned significant third parties regarding compliance and to date have not been advised of any major non compliance issues 
non compliance by any of these companies could have a materially adverse impact on the company 
we will continue this process and in the fall of the company will develop appropriate contingency plans 
the estimates and conclusions in this description of the yk issue contain forward looking statements and are based on management s estimates of future events 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no

sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not anticipate sop having a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
