we will not necessarily update the information in this form k if any forward looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate 
details about risks affecting various aspects of our business are discussed throughout this form k 
investors should read all of these risks carefully 
overview in the management discussion and analysis section of this k we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page general business net sales in fiscal increased to million  an increase of from million of sales last year  which represents a record sales year for odwalla 
in fiscal  we had growth in all of our geographic market areas  expanded our presence in markets we entered in fiscal  and entered the atlanta market 
our net loss for the year was million or 
per share compared to a loss of million or per share last year 
the most significant reason for the fiscal loss is the result of the december california citrus freeze  which is discussed below 
our sales strength has come predominantly from continued penetration in existing markets  sales of new products and expansion into new markets 
we believe that continued recognition of the odwalla brand and consumer attraction to our products  new product introductions  better store shelves placement  increased placement of branded in store coolers  and increased delivery system support has contributed to our sales growth 
we experience quarterly fluctuations  sometimes significant  and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue in future quarters 
some factors behind the fluctuations include changes in the price or availability of raw materials  particularly fruit products  due to seasonality  weather and other factors  new product introductions  costs of expansion into new markets  which can continue for many quarters beyond the market entry date  sales promotions  buying patterns of consumers  competitor product introductions  overall economic trends influencing consumers 
in addition  weather patterns impacting consumers  including unseasonably cool or rainy weather  can result in fewer sales to consumers and ultimately lower sales to trade partners and higher return credits issued if we haven t been able to forecast and adjust for the change in consumer buying patterns 
while the dsd system offers many benefits to us  it is also an expensive and fairly fixed cost distribution system 
we have invested significantly in our production facility and management team  the benefit of this investment will result from higher volume of product through the facility 
conversely  lower volume than expected will result in higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 
finally  we may choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to competition in some markets  which usually has a negative short term effect on our results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net sales  certain statements of operations data for fiscal years  and these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
year ended august  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses sales and distribution marketing general and administrative recall and related costs income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net 

income tax benefit net income loss net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal our sales increase  which occurred in all geographic regions  resulted primarily from a growth in existing markets and accounts and new products and b sales volume from new markets 
net sales are also impacted by our expanded use of third party distributors  which grew at about the same rate as our own dsd business 
because we sell product to distributors at a wholesale price lower than the price to retail trade partners  our increased use of distributors will not produce the same net sales growth that would occur if the same number of products were sold to retail trade partners 
total sales in our newest markets  which include the midwest  mid atlantic and atlanta markets  were about of total sales and represent a significant increase from fiscal as we had just begun selling in some of these newer markets at that time 
our food bar business  which was introduced at the very end of fiscal  was also an important factor in fiscal as food bar sales represented just less than of our net sales in fiscal the sales increase in fiscal  which occurred in all geographic regions  resulted primarily from a new and returning products and b sales volume from new markets 
net sales in fiscal were also impacted by our expanded use of third party distributors 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of net sales in fiscal compared to million or of net sales in fiscal cost of sales was million or of net sales in fiscal gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal after increasing from in fiscal in late december  the san joaquin valley in central california experienced a citrus freeze that seriously damaged the navel orange crop 
other parts of california were also affected  but to a significantly lesser extent 
the freeze also impacted the california valencia orange crop and other citrus  which extended the impact throughout calendar year the immediate effect of the freeze was to increase the price of the fresh citrus we purchase  which continues currently 
we also experienced poorer citrus yields and some delay in fruit maturity 
the freeze also caused us to be more reliant on citrus sources farther from our production facility than in prior years  which caused an increase in freight cost 
gross margin decreased primarily due to a unfavorable pricing and yield for ingredients  primarily citrus  and b increases in labor  due to poorer yields  and co packing costs 
the continued use of third party distributors also negatively affected gross margins 
however  we believe that fiscal would have been profitable except for the impact of the citrus freeze 
as a result of the citrus freeze  we remain more dependent upon alternative and more expensive sources of fresh supply than in prior years 
we continue to use our extensive network of grower contacts to continually try to maintain our supply of fresh ingredients 
the effect on orange and other ingredient costs to odwalla beyond fiscal is not yet fully determined  but we expect to experience higher orange costs until the new crop is available in december or january the cost and quality of the new crop is not yet determined and could differ from current prices 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a favorable sourcing  pricing and yield for fruit and other ingredients  and b an increase in operating efficiency due to increased volume 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased significantly following the recall see recall and related costs on page due to reduced production volume  especially from october  through the second quarter of fiscal  although this increase from historical levels continued through fiscal sales and distribution 
sales and distribution expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from in fiscal sales and distribution expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales and in dollars in fiscal when compared to the and million in fiscal expenses will continue to be affected as we seek to find the proper mix between third party distributors and our own dsd system in a given market 
the perishable nature of most of our products and our stringent service standards can make it difficult to find appropriate distributors in some markets 
during fiscal  we experienced a full year of costs in our newest markets 
expansion into markets serviced by our dsd system  including the washington  dc area  requires an investment for some initial period 
we also began an investment in our national sales structure and in our dsd sales and operational structure 
we expect that this investment will result in efficiencies later in fiscal we expect to continue to have expansion costs as we enter new geographic markets 
the fiscal expense decrease as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal  resulted from increased sales volume supported by a more fixed cost operations structure  which was offset by national and regional labor costs and an increase in our expansion efforts compared to fiscal marketing 
marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal is the result of increased product tastings  both in retail locations and sponsorships of community events  consultants and product research and development 
in august  karen lucas joined odwalla as vice president  marketing 
we expect that marketing expenses will increase during fiscal  in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of net sales 
the marketing expenditures decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal primarily due to reduced executive payroll and operating expenses offset by an increase in advertising 
we had increased marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal to reinforce the existing consumer base and attract new consumers to the brand and products following the recall  expand outside communications  develop and launch new and newly formulated products and incur professional services related to consumer research 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal and million or of net sales in fiscal in fiscal  the increase resulted primarily from increased payroll in human resources  financial analysis and information technology personnel  increased recruiting and search firm costs  and consulting fees 
in fiscal  reductions in administrative payroll and consulting fees were the primary reasons for the decrease from fiscal recall and related costs 
on october   odwalla was notified by the state of washington environmental health services of an epidemiological link between several cases of e 
coli o h and odwalla s apple juice products 
we immediately implemented a recall of all odwalla products containing apple juice 
we experienced a significant decline in sales immediately following the recall and we weren t able to immediately and significantly modify certain on going production  distribution and other costs 
odwalla also incurred significant direct costs as a result of the recall  including advertising and public relations costs  legal and professional fees  cost of the product recalled including the labor and freight involved in the recall process  destruction of unsold product in inventory and packaging supplies  costs of leased sales and distribution equipment in excess of current volume requirements  costs of reformulating products and costs associated with the flash pasteurization process 
total recall and related costs in fiscal were million  including a million charge to establish a reserve for future professional fees related to the recall 
under our arrangement with our insurance company  we pay a portion of the legal fees related to third party claims resulting from the recall and related claims 
the reserve for professional fees is an estimate  and there can be no assurance that the actual reserved liability established will be adequate 
we reviewed this charge during fiscal and  except for the settlement noted below  believed that the reserve established was adequate 
in fiscal  we reviewed available information  including recently filed claims  and added  to this reserve 
we will continue to assess this liability and will make appropriate adjustments if circumstances change 
approximately million of this reserve for professional fees remained at august  recall and related costs of million in fiscal represent the present value of the settlement with the us government in connection with the grand jury investigation begun in fiscal see item  legal proceedings on page for additional information 
interest and other expense income 
odwalla had net interest expense in fiscal of  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal and net interest income of  in fiscal gross interest income of   and  in fiscal  and resulted primarily from the remainder of the proceeds of the may public offering and  in  the proceeds of the january series a preferred stock offering 
gross interest expense of   and  in fiscal  and resulted primarily from interest on the line of credit established in may  capital lease interest and other debt 
income tax benefit 
the   and million income tax benefit for fiscal  and results from the tax benefit associated with operating losses 
the effective tax rate in and after offsetting the impact of the non deductible settlement with the us government discussed previously for and the effective tax rate in varies from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to the effect of establishing a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of such assets 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance as additional information regarding the impact of the recall on the company s future profitability is available 
liquidity and capital resources at august   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at august  the increase resulted primarily from financing activities 
at august   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at the end of fiscal net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million 
this consisted of the net loss plus depreciation  amortization and an increase in accounts payable  offset by increases in prepaid expenses  inventory and accounts receivable and decreases in other accrued expenses 
increases in accounts payable and accounts receivable are generally due to increased expense and sales volume compared to the same time period in fiscal the inventory increase represents acquisition of frozen raw materials during the summer of prepaid expenses increased primarily due to the timing of insurance payments  advances for future costs and refundable deposits and similar items 
accrued expenses  which includes the reserve for recall related professional fees  decreased primarily as we paid for previously accrued costs 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted principally of transferring funds to short term investments and capital expenditures for production equipment at the dinuba plant and  to a lesser extent  computer equipment and coolers 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million 
this consisted principally of proceeds from the sale of series a preferred stock and from common stock option exercises offset by payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations 
we had purchase commitments for the future delivery of raw materials as of august   approximately million of which are under contracts and are expected to be completed by august we ve used  and expect to continue to use  both operating and capital lease financing to obtain refrigeration coolers used in selling our products  computer and communication equipment  and production assets  primarily equipment 
we are currently discussing additional lease lines with several companies  although we don t have any commitments from a leasing company and there can be no assurance that we will obtain the requested commitment 
if we don t obtain adequate lease or other financing  our ability to obtain needed equipment may negatively impact our operations 
at august   we owed  for capital lease obligations  primarily related to leasing of production equipment and delivery vehicles 
on january   we signed an agreement with catterton simon partners iii  lp catterton simon  a delaware limited partnership  to sell  shares of odwalla series a preferred stock series a stock at per share 
the series a stock receives an annual dividend which is payable in either cash or additional series a stock  at our election 
the dividend is payable semi annually 
all series a stock is convertible on a one for one basis into odwalla common stock a upon a request by catterton simon at any time after july   and b automatically upon the earlier of i an acquisition of odwalla by another company  either for cash or publicly traded stock  at a price in excess of per share  ii the average trading price of odwalla common stock exceeding per share for consecutive trading days  or iii january  holders of series a stock are entitled to preferential payment  in the event of any liquidation of odwalla  in an amount equal to the greater of per share  plus any accrued but unpaid dividends  or the amount due each holder of common stock 
the minimum liquidation preference is million at august  catterton simon also received a warrant to purchase  shares of odwalla common stock at per share 
the warrant expires in seven years 
this transaction was funded and closed in february we also paid fees and issued a warrant to our financial advisor in connection with this transaction 
the warrant is for  shares of common stock at an exercise price approximating per share and expires in five years 
total costs of the transaction approximate  including the financial advisor fees other than the warrant described above  reimbursement of certain costs of catterton simon and other transaction costs 
on june   our board of directors declared a stock dividend of  series a preferred stock shares for the series a shareholder 
the dividend was paid june  in may  we entered into a loan and security agreement security agreement with a lender which provided a revolving line of credit up to million 
our borrowings were limited to of eligible accounts receivable receivable line plus up to  for new capital equipment equipment line 
eligible accounts receivable were defined in the security agreement and generally represented all trade accounts receivable less balances that were delinquent 
we paid monthly interest on borrowings at prime plus  which was at august  during  we borrowed only under the receivable line 
if we borrowed under the equipment line  we would pay interest only for the first three months and then pay monthly interest and principal payments using a month amortization schedule 
the security agreement contained certain restrictions  including the ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends  purchase or otherwise acquire company stock  or encumber or sell company assets 
the interest rate changed to prime plus if our adjusted net worth  as defined  was less than million 
we were required to pay interest on million whether or not we borrowed that amount and  accordingly  we had borrowed approximately million under the receivable line at august  all of our assets were pledged as collateral under the security agreement 
in september  we entered into a revolving credit agreement credit agreement with a new lender and paid the balance then outstanding under  and terminated  the security agreement 
the credit agreement provides a revolving credit facility up to million 
the first million of borrowings do not require separate borrowing base reporting 
borrowings over million and up to million are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
the credit agreement defines eligible accounts receivable which generally represents all trade accounts receivable less delinquent balances 
interest is payable monthly at either the prime interest rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus 
the interest rate to be incurred is selected by odwalla at the inception of each loan and may be changed during the period in which the borrowed amount is outstanding in accordance with provisions included in the credit agreement 
the initial term of the credit agreement is for three years 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral under the credit agreement 
we are also required to meet certain covenants  including maintenance of certain financial  leverage  and debt service coverage ratios  and certain tangible net worth 
the credit agreement also contains certain business restrictions  including the ability to borrow additional funds  limitations on capital expenditures in excess of certain amounts  restrictions on the payment of cash dividends  sale or purchase of company stock  ability to encumber or sell company assets  and limitations on other business transactions without prior approval from the lender 
the increased costs associated with recovering from the impact of the recall  our plans to invest in certain new market areas  and general corporate needs may cause us to seek additional financing that may be dilutive to current investors or result in a higher debt to equity ratio than would otherwise be the case 
any financing we obtain may not be on terms favorable to us  even if it is available 
odwalla maintains insurance coverage for product recall  product adulteration  lost income and other first party business risks 
the claim we submitted to our insurance carriers for product recall costs and for business losses incurred due to the recall was denied for substantially all of the amounts claimed 
on may   odwalla filed a lawsuit in united states district court for the eastern district of california in fresno  california  against new hampshire insurance company to seek recovery on our business interruption insurance claim 
the case does not have a trial date set 
the amount and timing of proceeds  if any  from the claims and any future insurance claims cannot be presently determined 
based upon information currently available  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our current and anticipated borrowing capability will be adequate to meet our obligations as they become due in the next twelve months 
year many existing computer systems use only the last two digits to identify a year 
consequently  as the year approaches  many systems do not yet recognize the difference in a year that begins with instead of this  as well as other date related processing issues  may cause systems to fail or malfunction unless corrected 
we began taking steps to identify and address our internal year issues in our internal team  which has executive sponsorship  consists of both internal and external personnel 
we have reviewed certain systems  including information systems  handheld computer systems  production systems and non information systems including phones 
we have modified certain systems and have scheduled modifications on other systems 
we have substantially completed our efforts to address the readiness of key third parties with which we have relationships  including suppliers and distributors 
we expect to have this process completed by the end of november while we may obtain assurances from third parties regarding their year readiness  we do not have any plans to otherwise assess their readiness and do not expect to perform such an assessment 
while year costs incurred to date have not been material  we may incur additional costs as we complete our readiness 
we don t believe that the additional costs will be material  but we have not completed our assessment and can t offer assurance regarding the additional costs 
we believe we are dedicating adequate resources toward attaining year readiness  but there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to address all year issues 
as with all companies  we also rely on other more widely used entities including government agencies  public utilities and other external forces common to business and industry 
consequently  if such entities were to experience year failures  this could disrupt our ability to conduct ongoing operations 
we have not developed a contingency plan in the event we experience potential failures 
we intend to assess the need for contingency plans  but can t offer any assurance that we will successfully develop such plans for areas that might result in significant exposure 
the above discussion regarding costs  risks and estimated completion dates for the year is based on our best estimates given information that is currently available  and is subject to change 
as we continue to study this issue  we may discover that actual results will differ materially from the estimates noted above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
due to this  we did not have significant overall currency exposure at august  foreign currency rate risk 
as almost all of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we have experienced only insignificant foreign exchange gains and losses to date  and we do not expect to incur significant gains and losses 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
