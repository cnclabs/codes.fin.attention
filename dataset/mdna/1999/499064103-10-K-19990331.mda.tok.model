as a result of the preceding changes  the company s net income as a percentage of operating revenue was in  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
the company s primary source of capital has been funds provided by operations  term borrowings to finance equipment purchases  the company s line of credit  and the company s initial and secondary public offerings in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  office equipment and leasehold improvements totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

under the company s line of credit  the company is obligated to comply with certain financial covenants 
the rate of interest on borrowings against the line of credit will vary depending upon the interest rate election made by the company  based on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus  or the prime rate 
at december   and march   the company had  in borrowings under its revolving line of credit 
the line of credit expires in may management believes the company will be able to renew or renegotiate its line of credit on terms at least as favorable as the current terms of the line of credit 
the company borrowed million during under a long term promissory note with its lender 
the note is unsecured and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
as of december    was currently owed under the note  with monthly payments of  payable through october management believes that the cash flow from operating activities and the availability of borrowings will be sufficient to meet the company s capital needs through the next months 
the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require the company to incur additional debt or seek additional equity capital in the future 
the availability of this capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of the company s common stock and other factors over which the company has no control  as well as the company s financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality to date  the company s revenue has not shown any significant seasonal pattern 
because the company operates primarily in arizona  california and the western united states  winter weather generally has not adversely affected the company s business 
expansion of the company s operations in the midwest  on the east coast  and in the texas and louisiana regions  could expose the company to greater operating variances due to seasonal weather in these regions 
inflation many of the company s operating expenses  including fuel costs and fuel taxes  are sensitive to the effects of inflation and changing prices  which could result in higher operating costs and lower income from operations 
the effects of inflation on the company s business during  and generally was not significant 
during  the company experienced historically low fuel prices  as a result of conditions in the petroleum industry 
the conditions that created these historic low price conditions may not persist 
year capabilities 
the year issue arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the company has implemented or is in the process of reviewing  testing  and implementing various modifications to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly in the year and beyond 
for this purpose  the term computer equipment and software includes systems commonly referred to as information technology systems it systems  such as data processing  dispatch  accounting  telephone  and other miscellaneous systems as well as systems that are not commonly referred to as it systems  such as fax machines  heating and air conditioning systems  and other miscellaneous systems 
the company has been and will be in contact with its significant vendors  service providers  and customers  particularly those with whom electronic data information edi transactions are exchanged  to determine and resolve any year issues 
the company currently anticipates that all necessary year modifications will be completed in the next six months  and that such efforts will be completed prior to any anticipated impact on its computer equipment and software 
all internal and external costs associated with the company s year compliance activities are expensed as incurred 
the company believes that the costs of addressing the year issue will not have a material impact on its financial position 
since all major computerized systems and applications will have been reviewed and tested as part of the year project  the company feels that it has reasonably addressed all material risks that may effect its operations 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified and corrected  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially effect the company s relationships with vendors  customers  and others 
also  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities with whom the company deals will not have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is in the process of evaluating and developing a contingency plan to provide for the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios regarding year compliance 
the contingency plan is expected to be completed in recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  gains and losses in a full set for general purpose financial statements 
sfas requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements 
reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
this statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  factors that may affect future results a number of factors over which the company has little or no control may affect the company s future results 
fuel prices  insurance costs  liability claims  interest rates  the availability of qualified drivers  fluctuations in the resale value of revenue equipment  and customers business cycles and shipping demands are economic factors over which the company has little or no control 
significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates or increases in insurance costs or liability claims  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates  would reduce the company s profitability 
although the company s independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment  fuel and other operating costs  significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from the company or other contractual opportunities 
difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers  including independent contractors  or a downturn in customers business cycles or shipping demands also could have a material adverse effect on the growth and profitability of the company 
if a shortage of drivers should occur in the future or if the company were unable to continue to attract and contract with independent contractors  the company could be required to adjust its driver compensation package  which could adversely affect the company s profitability if not offset by a corresponding increase in rates 
the company s growth has been made possible through the addition of new revenue equipment 
difficulty in financing or obtaining new revenue equipment for example  delivery delays from manufacturers or the unavailability of independent contractors could restrict future growth 
if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could be forced to retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses for maintenance and repairs 
the company has experienced significant and rapid growth in revenue and profits since the inception of its business in there can be no assurance that the company s business will continue to grow in a similar fashion in the future or that the company can effectively adapt its management  administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of the company s business or by changes in economic conditions 
currently  a significant portion of the company s business is concentrated in the arizona and california markets and a general economic decline or a natural disaster in either of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the growth and profitability of the company 
if the company is successful in deriving a more significant portion of its revenues from markets in the texas and louisiana regions and the midwest and on the east coast in the near future  its growth and profitability could be materially adversely affected by general economic declines or natural disasters in those markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and business operations and marketing and customers 
the company has established operations near houston  texas to provide dedicated services to one of its larger customers and to commence regional service in the texas and louisiana regions and initiated operations in indianapolis  indiana  in order to access markets in the midwest and on the east coast 
these operations will require the commitment of additional revenue equipment and personnel  as well as management resources  for future development 
these initiatives represent the first established operations of the company in markets outside of its primary regional operations in the western united states 
should the growth in the company s operations near houston  texas or in indianapolis  indiana slow or stagnate  the results of company operations could be adversely affected 
the company may encounter operating conditions in these new markets that differ substantially from those previously experienced in its western united states markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s regional operating strategy  as employed in the western united states  can be duplicated successfully or that it will not take longer than expected or require a more substantial financial commitment than anticipated in order for the company to generate positive operating results in these new markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under financial accounting reporting release number issued by the securities and exchange commission in january  the company is required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
the company has elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company has not had occasion to use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and does not use them for either speculation or trading 
because the company s operations are confined to the united states  the company is not subject to foreign currency risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  to the extent it borrows against its line of credit or incurs additional debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment 
the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by carrying as little debt as possible 
the company has not entered into interest rate swaps or other strategies designed to protect it against interest rate risk 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  based on the level of debt carried by the company as of december  management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by the company in the near future 
the company has not issued corporate debt instruments 
the company is subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel and tires 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
the company has installed fuel islands at its phoenix  arizona and indianapolis facilities which enable it to purchase fuel at rack prices  saving pumping charges 
where possible  the company seeks to participate in tire testing programs to reduce the cost of tires 
it is the company s policy to pass on price increases in fuel  tires  or other commodities through rate increases or surcharges  to the extent the existing market will permit such costs to be passed through to the customer 
if the company were unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases  such increases could adversely affect the company s results of operations
