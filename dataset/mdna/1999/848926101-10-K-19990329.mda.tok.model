item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the company considers the us adhesive backed materials industry to be over billion  consisting of the approximately billion total tape market and the approximately billion adhesive backed label stock market includes adhesive backed label stock revenues plus estimated revenues added by printing  cutting and other converting and finishing operations 
the company is one of the leading manufacturers and marketers of adhesive backed materials  primarily for the industrial tape and pressure sensitive label stock markets 
central products branded and private label carton sealing tape products are used primarily for commercial packaging applications  including the packaging of goods for shipment by manufacturing  retail and distribution companies  and are sold through its national sales force to over  paper and office products distributors nationwide 
spinnaker electrical manufactures and markets pressure sensitive industrial electrical tapes used for insulation in the production of motors  coils and transformers 
spinnaker electrical sells domestically through its own sales organization and into eastern europe through a relationship with the world s largest distributor of electrical products 
spinnaker coating offers a full line of more than  variations of label stock and sells its products in roll or sheet form to over  printers  paper merchants and industrial users  who convert the label stock into labels used for a broad range of end use applications  including bar coding  mailing and shipping  packaging for pharmaceutical  food and other consumer products  office identification and business forms  postage stamp stock  decorative labels and other specialty industrial uses 
the company also manufactures and markets industrial process equipment and air pollution control scrubbers through entoleter 
since june  the company has experienced rapid growth  which has been accomplished through the company s acquisition of its industrial tape and adhesive backed label stock manufacturing operations and the company s subsequent internal growth 
the internal growth is a result of the company s implementation of its core competencies to the operations  including refocused sales and marketing strategy and additional capital investment at all subsidiaries 
over the last three years  the company has averaged approximately million per year in capital expenditures to improve manufacturing efficiencies  which has lowered manufacturing costs and improved production efficiencies  while simultaneously increasing production capacity 
the investments included an expansion in coating capacity for label stock production  which lowered manufacturing costs  and enhancements in its film line and coating lines  which increased tape production capacity and efficiency enabling the company to transition from a seven day to a five day work week at its brighton manufacturing facility 
with the acquisition of spinnaker coating in  the company entered the adhesive backed materials industry 
the central products acquisition in provided the company with a leading position in the carton sealing tape market of the adhesive backed materials industry 
as a result of the foregoing acquisitions  the company became a manufacturer of the broadest line of adhesive backed label stock and carton sealing tape products in the adhesive backed materials industry 
the coating maine acquisition and the electrical tape acquisition further strengthen the company s position in the adhesive backed materials market 
the company believes the combination of coating maine with spinnaker coating s adhesive backed label stock business makes the company the fifth largest producer of label stock and the second largest manufacturer of edp label stock 
the electrical tape acquisition strengthens the company s industrial tape product offering and coating technology 
the company believes the acquisition of the electrical tape business positions the company as the third largest manufacturer and marketer of high temperature industrial tape 
subsequent to each of the foregoing acquisitions  the company implemented cost reduction measures  including more effective management  rationalization of raw materials and component purchasing  improved materials flow and improved management information systems 
the company believes such measures contributed to improved operating profits at the company s carton sealing tape and label stock manufacturing operations in  and softened the impact of heightened market competition and asian imports during the company has historically operated at a high level of capacity utilization and has increased capacity of the acquired plant facilities through operating efficiency improvements 
for example  early in central products completed the transition from a seven day to a five day workweek at its brighton  colorado facility 
the capital investments over the past twelve to eighteen months have improved manufacturing efficiencies to a point that enables the company to meet current production requirements with fewer man hours  thereby saving approximately to million on an annual basis through the elimination of approximately fifty manufacturing personnel 
another example is the silicone coating production line at spinnaker coating 
in order to meet production capacity requirements under the postage stamp stock agreements awarded to spinnaker coating in and  spinnaker coating invested approximately million to add a production line for silicone coating 
during  before the addition of the new production line  spinnaker coating outsourced a portion of its silicone coated liner requirement 
the company incurred higher costs of sales approximately million for the year ended december   as a result of such outsourcing 
the installation of the additional production line was completed by the end of the fourth quarter of and became fully operational in january  which enabled the company to meet its future silicone liner production requirements and eliminated the costs that were associated with outsourcing 
the cost of the company s principal raw materials  polypropylene resin and paper  have generally remained stable or declined over the past several years 
historically  any raw material cost increases have resulted in the company instituting higher prices  consistent with the increases instituted by its competitors  for its industrial tape and adhesive backed label stock products 
the increases in raw material costs for the company s products have not materially impacted the company s gross profit because the company has generally been able to pass along its raw material cost increases without negatively impacting sales of its products 
in  the company s principal raw material costs generally declined as a result of scale economies associated with the combined operations of spinnaker coating  coating maine and central products 
the agreements under which the company s industrial tape products and its other adhesive backed label stock products are sold generally do not contain adjustment mechanisms for fluctuations in the cost of raw materials 
however  the company has generally passed along raw material price changes for products sold under such agreements  as well as for products sold to other customers 
the exception to the foregoing is the company s supply agreement relating to pressure sensitive label stock used by the postal service  which provides for pre determined annual price increases 
the postal service agreement gives the company protection against limited price increases to the extent that increases in costs of raw materials are no more than the increases provided by such agreement 
in order to protect against raw material price increases that exceed the annual price increases under the postal service agreement  the company has entered into supply agreements with its raw material suppliers that have ceilings on future price increases 
the future impact of a change in raw material costs on the company s profitability is based in part on pricing by the company s competitors 
although historically the company has generally been able to pass through raw material cost fluctuations  the company cannot be assured that future raw material cost increases can be passed through to its customers or that such cost increases will not negatively impact the company s gross profit 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales were million  compared to million in the increase in net sales for is attributed to approximately million in sales from the recent acquisitions of coating maine and spinnaker electrical  in addition to increased unit sales of water activated carton sealing tape and certain label stocks from levels 
these increases partially offset lower unit sales of pressure sensitive carton sealing tape products and pressure sensitive postage paper stock 
sales of industrial tape products have been impacted by the significant slow down in asian growth consumption which resulted in an increase of imports from asia and europe into the us  increasing domestic competition 
these factors resulted in lower sales volumes of certain pressure sensitive tapes and affected product mix 
unit sales of pressure sensitive postage paper stock  which were impacted by the timing of orders by the bep earlier in the year  increased significantly during the last half of the year to near levels 
gross margins 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales in was approximately compared to approximately in the gross margins were lower due to changes in sales mix  competitive pricing in adhesive backed materials industry  the timing and new pricing of postage paper stock business  and a charge associated with a new hot melt tape product developed during the latter half of the year 
the impact of asian imports and increased global capacity for certain tape products  lowered average selling prices of certain product categories 
these factors lead to product substitution and changes in product mix 
the timing of postage paper stock business contributed to marginally lower units and a new five year million contract for the supply of postage paper stock resulted in lower average selling prices in the remaining variance is attributed to inventory charges totaling approximately million  primarily associated with a new hot melt tape product developed in the latter half of in response to certain market demands 
while the product tested well  it was found not to consistently perform and was discontinued 
the company has offset a portion of the margin pressures by continuing to improve manufacturing efficiencies  lowering average unit manufacturing costs  personnel reductions  and introducing new cost efficient products that meet market demands 
the company attributes the improved manufacturing to efficiencies gained through reductions of manufacturing personnel  material process and handling modifications and recent capital investments which have enabled the company to increase output and reduce manufacturing downtime 
these efforts have continued into  as in early january the company completed a transition of its brighton  colorado manufacturing facility from a seven day to a five day work week  resulting in reduced headcount and manufacturing overhead 
the annual savings from this action are estimated to be approximately million 
income from operations 
income from operations was approximately million  which net of charges impacting comparability  resulted in million for compared to million in the operating results reflect lower gross margins on increased net sales and lower selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales  offset by approximately million of increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of coating maine and spinnaker electrical 
these acquisitions increased net sales approximately million  however the company s sg a expenses excluding depreciation and amortization declined from approximately of net sales in to in the company has continued to rationalize administrative overhead and leverage the knowledge within and between the subsidiaries  which has enabled it to reduce selling and administrative costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for totaled approximately million  of which approximately million relates to amortization of deferred financing costs and payment in kind pik interest expense 
in  interest expense totaled approximately million  of which approximately  related to deferred financing costs 
the increase is primarily attributed to the financing associated with the company s acquisition of coating maine and spinnaker electrical  and the increase in the spinnaker credit facility from million to million 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes is at an effective rate of 
the company s tax rate is impacted by permanent tax differences  primarily non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the central products acquisition amortized over years and the write off of certain unrealizable deferred tax assets 
the company has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these carry forwards begin to expire in the year net income 
the company recorded a net loss of million or per share  which net of charges impacting comparability  resulted in a net loss of million or per share for  compared to a net loss of million or per share in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
the company s net sales were million compared to million in net sales of carton sealing tapes were impacted by the company s decision to terminate a relationship with an existing customer of the company s reinforced and box tape products  which reduced year to year net sales  by approximately million 
unit sales of carton sealing products  excluding the terminated agreement  increased from levels  which more than offset lower average selling prices resulting from changes in product mix and increased market competition 
unit sales of pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock were impacted by the delayed release of certain orders by the bep until late december  and inventory level adjustments by key consumer and converter product customers  while lower average selling prices of pressure sensitive adhesive backed label stock were a result of market competition to maintain certain unit sales volumes 
the decrease in net sales for also reflects a decline of million in sales of industrial equipment and higher freight costs 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the improvement in gross margins is attributable to lower average unit manufacturing costs of adhesive backed material products and improved manufacturing variances 
the installation of a new silicone coater at the company s adhesive backed label stock manufacturing facility  which became operational in january  enabled the company to significantly increase internal silicone coating capacity and eliminate the need to outsource a portion of its silicone coater requirements  resulting in savings during in  the company incurred approximately million of outsourcing costs attributable to silicone coating capacity constraints 
the company s tape production operations steadily improved throughout in comparison to  and showed significant improvement with respect to manufacturing variances experienced as recently as the first quarter of the company attributes these improvements in manufacturing variances to efficiencies gained through reductions of manufacturing personnel  material process and handling modifications and capital investments made over the past twelve to fifteen months which have enabled the company to increase output and reduce manufacturing downtime 
the company is continuing to focus its management efforts and capital investments on improving manufacturing efficiencies and increasing capacity 
income from operations 
income from operations was approximately million or of net sales in compared to million or of net sales in the improved operating results are attributable to capital investments in manufacturing and mis processes  and lower administrative expenses  which offset year to year increases in depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately million 
interest expense 
interest expense for totaled million  of which approximately thousand relates to amortization of deferred financing costs 
in  interest expense totaled million  of which approximately thousand related to amortization of deferred financing costs 
the increase in cash interest is attributable to higher average outstanding debt obligations and related interest rates for the fiscal year 
income taxes 
the income tax benefit for federal and state income taxes is at an effective rate of 
the company s tax rate is impacted by permanent tax differences  primarily non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the central products acquisition amortized over years 
cash income taxes are currently limited to state income taxes  as the company has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
net income 
the company recorded a net loss of million or per share for  versus a net loss of million or per share in in  the company recorded an extraordinary charge of approximately million net of income taxes  or a loss per share 
the charge was attributed to the extinguishment of the company s previously existing credit facilities and the write off of related deferred financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the principal sources of liquidity for the company and its subsidiaries other than spinnaker electrical have historically been cash flow from operations  proceeds from the issuance of the company s senior notes and availability under the company s million revolving credit facility spinnaker credit facility 
the company s cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in the increase was largely attributed to improved cash management and the exclusion of substantially all trade payables in the coating maine acquisition 
these factors were the basis for the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities from prior year 
the company s ability to fund its april  senior note interest payment of approximately million is dependent upon its availability under the spinnaker credit facility 
the company anticipates having sufficient availability under the spinnaker credit facility based on current operations 
the spinnaker credit facility is available to fund acquisitions and support periodic fluctuations in working capital 
credit availability under the spinnaker credit facility is subject to certain variables  such as inventory and receivables eligible to be included in the borrowing base 
the spinnaker credit facility will expire october the company is charged an unused credit fee every month of per annum 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at variable rates related to the prime interest rate or libor 
at december   the interest rate in effect was 
the funding for the coating maine acquisition was the company s initial borrowing under the spinnaker credit facility with the exception of periodic working capital borrowings by entoleter 
as of march   aggregate availability under the spinnaker credit facility was approximately million  of which approximately million was outstanding 
the other principal sources of liquidity for the company during was the issuance of the company s promissory note warren note to warren in the original principal amount of million in connection with the coating maine acquisition and the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of class a common stock  no par value  upon the exercise of the remaining class a warrants held by boyle fleming at a total price of million 
the warren note bears interest at the rate of  and includes a payment in kind pik feature that allows the company to pay the first year s interest payment by issuing an additional subordinated note under similar terms as the warren note 
the company may also issue such a pik note if at a future interest payment date a default or event of default exists  or would be caused by the payment of such interest in cash  under the spinnaker credit facility 
payments of principal and interest are subject to restrictions contained in  and in any event are junior and subordinate in right of payment to  the payment of indebtedness outstanding under the spinnaker credit facility and the company s senior notes due senior notes 
the warren note matures on january   however  it can be prepaid earlier if certain conditions or events occur 
prepayments of principal of and of the original principal amount are due on march  and march   respectively  subject to there being sufficient unused availability and no existing default or event of default under the spinnaker credit facility 
the company does not anticipate having sufficient unused availability under the terms of the spinnaker credit facility to allow a prepayment on march  the principal source of liquidity for spinnaker electrical is cash flow from operations and availability under its million revolving credit agreement electrical credit facility 
the electrical credit facility is separate and independent of the of the spinnaker credit facility  and is secured by the inventory and receivables of spinnaker electrical 
the electrical credit facility is subject to certain variables  such as inventory and receivables eligible to be included in the borrowing base 
as of march   aggregate availability was approximately million  of which approximately million was outstanding 
the other sources of liquidity for spinnaker electrical during were million in term debt and a million subordinated note issued by spinnaker electrical to tesa 
in addition  in connection with this acquisition  the company issued  shares of its common stock to tesa 
capital resources 
the company budgeted capital expenditures of approximately to million during  however  at december  the company had commitments for a minor portion of such capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient cash flow from operations and availability under the spinnaker credit facility to fund its commitments for such capital expenditures at december   as well as the additional capital expenditures budgeted for other the company announced on november  that it had retained schroder co  inc to seek strategic alternatives  including a possible sale  merger  or other business combination of the company 
the company continues to examine its strategic alternatives  however there can be no assurance that a sale  merger or other combination will be accomplished on terms satisfactory to the company s shareholders 
in february  spinnaker coating terminated approximately indirect manufacturing personnel  which is estimated to eliminate approximately million of costs on an annual basis 
the first quarter restructuring charge for severance and termination benefits is approximately million 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
when the year begins  this issue may cause some hardware and software to interpret as the year and either stop processing date related computations or process them incorrectly 
all computer hardware and software  building facilities and equipment utilized by the company require assessment to determine that they will continue to operate accurately when they encounter a year date before and after january  for this purpose  the term computer hardware and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as information technology it systems  including accounting  data processing  telephone pbx systems  computerized manufacturing equipment and other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain imbedded technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its it and non it systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company s year initiatives are being performed primarily by internal staff  and in certain operations  are supplemented by outside consultants 
no independent verification consultants have been hired by the company 
the company s external agent assurance initiative is approximately complete 
within each business segment  there is a concentration of critical suppliers 
identifying  querying and processing responses from critical groups has been the main thrust of the company s assurance initiative 
however  responses received from mailings to substantially all vendors  suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with the company are being processed and additional inquiries are being made as necessary 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely manner could materially impact the company 
the company s assessment initiative is approximately complete 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company believes that certain of the computer equipment and software it currently uses will require replacement or modification 
the company expects the assessment phase to be complete in june of beginning in  with the replacement of manufacturing and accounting systems at certain subsidiaries  the company obtains replacements in the ordinary course of improving manufacturing and reporting performance that are year compliant 
certain phases of major capital improvements related to accounting and manufacturing systems will be completed by september the company s testing and remediation initiatives are approximately complete and are expected to be complete in september of the remaining relates primarily to the completion of system conversions 
no capital projects have been deferred or delayed due to year efforts 
most year issues have been or will be eliminated by the normal upgrading process of computer systems and manufacturing equipment 
therefore  the incremental cost of addressing year issues has been and will continue to be funded from operating cash flows 
beginning with the major system conversion projects in  the company has spent million on it system replacements and upgrades to improve manufacturing and reporting performance to date 
the total incremental cost of addressing year issues on it and non it systems is estimated to be less than  future spending on system conversion projects is estimated to be approximately million  of which  approximately  will be directly related to addressing year compliance 
the estimated costs and projected dates of completion for the company s year program are based on management s estimates and were developed using numerous assumptions of future events  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing systems and converting to new systems  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company as a whole 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year process  resulting in part from the incertitude surrounding the state of readiness of third party suppliers and vendors  the company is unable to determine a reasonable worst case scenario at this time 
however  the company is currently assessing the impact of a worst case scenario in conjunction with the development of contingency plans  which are expected to be complete by june of if such modifications and conversions are not completed timely or are ineffective  the year issue may materially and adversely impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
