due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts or anticipated by the company based upon product development and introduction schedules could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock

these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company is aware of the year issue and has commenced a program to identify  remediate  test and develop plans to address the year issue 
its corporate networks and computing hardware operate on unix and microsoft windows nt operating systems 
the company relies on its fully integrated computer associates manman system mis system for all accounting  manufacturing  and procurement functions 
the company makes use of edi and other forms of electronic data exchange with two of its customers and one financial institution

as of february  the company had completed several year projects  including upgrades of its windows nt operating system and tape backup software  upgrade of its unix workstations  evaluation of the company s mis system  evaluation of the company s email and servers  evaluation of network routing  interconnect  and firewall hardware and software compliance  evaluation of the company s telephone  security  and voicemail equipment and evaluation of the company s products 
the company s review of the year issue with respect to its internal systems preliminarily indicates no material problems 
as of february  the following year projects are in process completion of the new email system and the conversion of email from the old system  upgrade of the unix operating system for the hp hardware which supports the company s mis system expected completion is april 
upgrade of the mis system software expected completion is april  development of a list of critical vendors and identification of any material vendor problems expected completion is april and evaluation of the company s edi partners expected completion is may

as of february  the company s aggregate expenditures excluding employee costs in connection with year compliance has been less than  and the company estimates the total cost of its year projects will be approximately  the company currently does not anticipate that the cost of year compliance will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
however  satisfactorily addressing the year issue is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
further  the company does not currently have any contingency plans if its planning activities fail 
should the company s internal systems or the internal systems of one or more significant vendors  manufacturers or suppliers fail to achieve year compliance  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s year compliance project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year issue and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of third parties it deals with 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced
