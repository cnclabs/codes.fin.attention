the company is not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with these lines of credit 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants related to these lines of credit at september  the company finances its expansion and renovation program primarily with cash provided from operations and from borrowings under its credit facilities

the company s principal sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flow from operations  borrowings under its lines of credit and long term financing

however  there can be no assurance that any such source of financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  it is possible that  in the future  the company s results of operations and financial condition will be different from that described in this report based on a number of intangible factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
factors that may affect results include changes in business and economic conditions generally in ingles operating area  increased competition  changing regional and national economic conditions  adverse climatic conditions affecting food production and delivery and changing demographics

the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators 
the majority of the company s properties are self insured for casualty losses and business interruption  however liability coverage is maintained 
the company believes that its mix between insurance and self insurance is prudent  is in accordance with general industry practice and is in the best interest of the company

as part of the year project  the company has identified relationships with third parties  including vendors  suppliers  and service providers  whom the company believes are critical to its business operations 
although the company considered several factors in identifying these critical relationships  the company concentrated its communication efforts with suppliers and vendors from whom the company makes annual purchases in excess of thousand 
the company has communicated with these third parties through letters and interviews in an effort to determine the extent to which they have addressed their year compliance issues 
the company has received responses from its critical suppliers  the majority of which have indicated they anticipate being year compliant 
the company cannot assure that there will not be an adverse impact on the company if third parties have not appropriately addressed their year issues 
possible consequences in such event include  but are not limited to  loss of communications with stores  loss of electric power  the inability of vendors to supply timely delivery of inventory and an inability to process customer transactions or otherwise engage in similar normal business activities 
although the company does not believe the actual impact of any system failures related to the century change will be material  the company has developed various contingency plans with its critical suppliers and certain other vendors in order to assure the timely delivery of inventory and continuance of normal business activities following the year change 
the company has also developed contingency plans to respond to unexpected system failures in the stores 
the above assessment is based on management s best estimates and may be updated from time to time as additional information becomes available
