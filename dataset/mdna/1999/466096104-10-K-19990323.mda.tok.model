item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general for fiscal  j 
alexander s corporation incurred a loss before income taxes of  this compares to a loss in of  before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the results include a gain of  related to the divestiture of the company s wendy s operations in as further discussed below 
an additional gain of  was recorded on the divestiture in the loss before the wendy s gains  income taxes and cumulative effect adjustment decreased by  in compared to  as higher restaurant operating income and reduced pre opening expenses more than offset increased net interest expense and a slight increase in general and administrative expenses during the company s net loss of  for includes no income tax benefit  and all of the company s deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and various tax credit carryforwards  are fully reserved at january  the company s loss of  before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle compares to income before income taxes of  in the results included a gain from the divestiture of the wendy s division of  income before wendy s gains  income taxes and the cumulative effect adjustment decreased by  in compared to  as a nominal increase in in restaurant operating income from j 
alexander s restaurants combined with decreases in general and administrative expenses and in net interest expense were not adequate to offset the loss of restaurant operating income resulting from the wendy s divestiture 
the company s net loss of  for included an increase of  in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and an  charge to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in the company s accounting principle for pre opening costs to expense them as incurred 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its franchised wendy s old fashioned hamburgers restaurant operations to wendy s international  inc for million in cash plus the assumption of capitalized lease obligations and long term debt totaling approximately million 
the sale to wendy s international  inc included wendy s restaurants and the company s remaining six wendy s restaurants were sold or closed 
management reached the decision to sell the wendy s operations because it believed that focusing all of the company s capital and resources exclusively on its casual dining business offered the greatest potential for long term return for its shareholders 
however  as a result of the divestiture  sales and income from restaurant operations were significantly reduced in and and the divestiture is expected to continue to have a negative impact on earnings until the lost revenue and operating income from the wendy s operations can be replaced by the successful development and operation of j 
alexander s restaurants 
during the company s wendy s restaurants generated restaurant operating income of  on sales of  through november of that year

alexander s restaurants increased in both and compared to the prior years  primarily as a result of new restaurant openings 
also fiscal contained weeks of operations compared to weeks for both and average weekly sales per restaurant increased to  in from  in  while s average sales represented a decrease of from  in restaurant costs and expenses remained constant at of sales in and as all expense categories for the same store restaurant group improved and offset higher costs associated with the two new restaurants opened in restaurant costs and expenses as a percentage of sales increased in as compared to in largely due to the effects of new restaurant openings 
cost of sales  which includes food and alcoholic beverage costs  decreased as a percentage of sales from to due primarily to management s emphasis on cost controls in this area 
also  this expense category is less sensitive to the effect of lower sales volumes than the other categories which have large fixed components 
same store sales and restaurant operating income  which include comparable results for all restaurants open for more than twelve months  increased in both and as compared to the prior years 
same store sales for averaged  per week on a base of restaurants  a increase over  for the increase in same store sales during is attributed to menu price increases of approximately which were implemented in each of march  may and july of as well as an increase of approximately in guest counts 
operating margins as a percentage of sales for this group of restaurants improved to in from in due to the favorable effect of higher sales volumes  particularly as relates to labor costs and other operating expenses  which include certain components which are relatively fixed 
same store sales for on a base of thirteen restaurants increased by to an average of  per week from  in for this same group of restaurants  restaurant operating income as a percentage of sales increased to from 
j 
alexander s overall financial performance has been significantly affected by the number of new restaurants opened during the last four years during which time the number of restaurants increased from five to in order to maximize the quality of guest service and successfully complete the extensive training and support of j 
alexander s staff  there is typically little or no advertising or promotion of new j 
alexander s restaurant openings 
management believes that this quiet opening approach enhances guest experiences and contributes significantly to increases in sales over a long period of time 
however  because this approach often results in slow sales growth until a new restaurant s reputation grows and because of the expenses associated with the company s emphasis on training and quality of operations during the opening months of operation  the financial performance of newer restaurants typically trails that of more mature restaurants and the company expects newly opened restaurants to experience operating losses in their initial months of operation 
in addition  some of the company s newer restaurants have not experienced the increases in sales expected by management  thus compounding the effect of these new restaurants on financial performance 
to illustrate the effects of new restaurants on results of operations  losses incurred at the restaurant level in the year of opening totaled approximately  for the two restaurants opened in   for the four restaurants opened in and  for the five restaurants opened in results in the company s restaurants generally improve significantly after their first full year of operation 
because the breakeven point for a j 
alexander s restaurant is relatively high due to the high fixed costs necessary to deliver and sustain the high levels of food quality  service and ambiance which are critical components of the j 
alexander s concept  management continues to believe that the primary issue faced by the company in returning it to consistent profitability is the improvement of sales in several of its restaurants  particularly its newer restaurants 
management intends to accomplish this through a series of initiatives which began in when guest service support was increased in some of the company s newer restaurants in order to ensure the highest quality of operations 
additionally menu prices were reduced in some of the restaurants which were not posting satisfactory guest count increases 
while these strategies increased the company s losses for  guest counts increased significantly in these restaurants 
other actions which improved results and should continue to have a favorable impact during include the implementation of operational systems designed to provide quicker service and increase table turns and the implementation during the fourth quarter of of an extensive profit improvement plan which included certain menu and procedural changes and which took advantage of significant purchasing opportunities 
this plan resulted in significant food cost savings without sacrificing product quality  while also improving the quality and efficiency of operations 
management believes that all or virtually all of the company s restaurants have the potential over time to reach satisfactory sales levels 
beginning in  the company lowered its new restaurant development plans to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants while maintaining operational excellence 
the lower expansion rate will also reduce start up related expenses 
the company opened two restaurants in and currently plans to open one restaurant in and two in management remains optimistic about the long term prospects for j 
alexander s 
it believes that actions taken to date as well as continued emphasis on increasing sales and profits will have a positive impact on financial performance for and that the company will be profitable in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include supervisory costs as well as management training costs and all other costs above the restaurant level for j 
alexander s and  before  wendy s operations  increased slightly in fiscal compared to for the year  favorable experience under the company s workers compensation program for the current and prior policy years and the company s self insured group medical insurance program largely offset increases in management training costs and relocation costs for restaurant management personnel 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in due to higher sales levels achieved 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in compared to due to the disposition of the wendy s operations 
as expected  however  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in  because these expenses did not decrease in proportion to the reduction in revenues resulting from the wendy s divestiture 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase as a percentage of sales in compared to as management does not anticipate favorable insurance experiences in similar to those noted above 
pre opening expense in the company changed its accounting policy to expense all pre opening costs as incurred rather than deferring and amortizing them over a period of twelve months from each restaurant s opening 
a charge of  was recorded as of the beginning of to reflect the cumulative effect of this change 
in the company changed its amortization period for pre opening costs from twenty four months to twelve months 
due to only two restaurants being opened in  pre opening expenses  which are approximately  per restaurant  were  less in than in interest income and expense interest expense increased by  in compared to due to the use of the company s line of credit to fund a portion of the cost of developing new restaurants and due to lower amounts of capitalized interest resulting from the company s lower new restaurant development rate 
interest expense decreased by  in compared to due to the elimination of long term obligations associated with the company s wendy s restaurant operations and a reduction in average balances outstanding under the company s line of credit as a result of the use of a portion of the proceeds from the wendy s divestiture to retire the outstanding balance of the line of credit at that time and to fund a portion of the company s capital needs for there was no interest income in due to the use in of the remaining proceeds from the company s wendy s divestiture to fund a portion of the cost of developing new j 
alexander s restaurants 
interest income increased by  in compared to due to increased investment balances resulting from the wendy s divestiture 
income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at january  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at january  relate primarily to  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 
the recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets must be reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not likely to be generated in such amounts 
no allowance was deemed necessary during and earnings for the year were taxed at an effective rate of 
due to the loss incurred in and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of operating costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized and in the fourth quarter of increased the beginning of the year valuation allowance for these assets by  at december   the company s valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was  during  management was again unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized 
at january   the company has recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  approximately  of future taxable income would be needed to realize the company s tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards at january  these carryforwards expire in the years through approximately  of taxable income would be needed to realize the carryforwards which expire in and  to use those which expire in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for capital has historically been and is expected to continue to be capital expenditures for the development of new restaurants 
this need has been reduced  however  as a result of the company s lower new restaurant development rate beginning in capital expenditures totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
also included in these amounts were capital expenditures for the wendy s division of  for which included facilities upgrades and miscellaneous equipment replacements 
the company s capital expenditures for new restaurants significantly exceeded the cash flow generated from operations for the last three years  with the difference being funded primarily by proceeds from the sale of the company s wendy s operations in and use of the company s bank line of credit 
for  the company plans to construct and open one restaurant on leased land in west bloomfield  michigan at a cost of approximately million 
management estimates that total capital expenditures for the company for will be million to million  the variance depending primarily on the amount expended for restaurants to be opened in while a working capital deficit of  existed as of january   the company does not believe that this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company because it expects cash flow from operations to be adequate to meet current obligations  including a scheduled sinking fund payment of  in on its convertible subordinated debentures 
certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  thus virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
the company maintains a bank line of credit of million which is expected to be used as needed for funding of capital expenditures through its expiration date of july  and which will also provide liquidity for meeting working capital or other needs 
at january   borrowings outstanding under this line of credit were  the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants which require the company to achieve specified levels of senior debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and to maintain certain other financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at january  and  based on a current assessment of its business  believes it will continue to comply with those covenants through july  the credit agreement also contains certain limitations on capital expenditures and restaurant development by the company generally limiting the company to the development of two new restaurants per year and restricts the company s ability to incur additional debt outside the bank line of credit 
the interest rate on borrowings under the line of credit is currently based on libor plus a spread of two to three percent  depending on the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the line of credit includes an option to convert outstanding borrowings to a term loan prior to july  in march the company developed a plan for raising additional equity capital to further strengthen its financial position and  as part of this plan  completed a private sale of  shares of common stock for approximately million 
in addition  the company is filing a registration statement for a proposed rights offering pursuant to which shareholders of the company on the record date for distribution of the rights will be given the opportunity to purchase up to  shares of common stock at a price of per share  which is the same price per share as stock sold in the private sale 
if the maximum number of shares are sold pursuant to the rights offering  the company will receive net proceeds of approximately million 
proceeds from the above transactions have been or will be used to repay borrowings outstanding under the company s line of credit 
amounts repaid can be reborrowed in accordance with the terms of the line of credit agreement 
the company believes that raising additional equity capital and repaying a portion of its outstanding debt will benefit the company by reducing its debt to equity ratio and reducing interest expense and that it will provide greater flexibility to the company in providing for future financing needs 
impact of accounting changes there are no pending accounting pronouncements that  when adopted  are expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations or its financial condition 
impact of the year issue introduction 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software has historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date field 
the company s state of readiness 
the company s key financial  informational and operational systems have been assessed and detailed plans have been developed to address system modifications required by september  these systems include information technology systems it 
the company has assessed its major it vendors and technology providers and is in the process of testing its systems to determine year compliance 
in addition  the company is in the process of assessing its non it systems that utilize embedded technology such as microcontrollers and reviewing them for year compliance 
to operate its business  the company relies upon government agencies  utility companies  providers of telecommunication services  suppliers  and other third party service providers material relationships  over which it can assert little control 
the company s ability to conduct its core business is dependent upon the ability of these material relationships to fix their year issues to the extent they affect the company 
if the telecommunications carriers  public utilities and other material relationships do not appropriately rectify their year issues  the company s ability to conduct its core business may be materially impacted  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company has begun an assessment of all material relationships to determine risk and assist in the development of contingency plans 
this effort is to be completed by june  costs to address the company s year issues 
the company expenses costs associated with year system changes as the costs are incurred except for system change costs that the company would otherwise capitalize 
to date  the company has incurred costs of approximately  in connection with its year compliance plan year plan and estimates it will spend an additional  to  to complete its year plan 
the financial impact of these expenses has not been material  and the company does not expect future remediation costs to be material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  the company is unable to estimate the costs that it may incur as a result of year problems suffered by the parties with which it deals  such as material relationships  and there can be no assurance that the company will successfully address the year problems present in its own systems 
risks presented by year problems 
the company has begun the testing phase of its year plan 
however  until testing is substantially in process the company cannot fully assess the risks of its year issue 
as a result of the testing process  the company may identify areas of its business that are at risk of year disruption 
the absence of any such determination at this point represents only the current status of the implementation of the company s year plan  and should not be construed to mean that there is no area of the company s business which is at risk of a year related disruption 
as noted above  many of the company s business critical material relationships may not appropriately address their year issues  the result of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s contingency plans 
the company s year plan calls for the development of contingency plans for areas of the business that are determined to be susceptible to substantial risk of a disruption resulting from a year related event 
because the company s testing phase is not substantially in process  and accordingly it has not fully assessed its risk from potential year failures  the company has not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year events for any specific area of business 
the company does  however  maintain contingency plans  outside of the scope of the year issue  designed to address various other business interruptions 
the company is prepared for the possibility that the testing process may hereafter identify certain areas of business at risk 
consistent with its year plan  the company will develop specific year contingency plans  to the extent practicable  for such areas of business as and if such determinations are made 
impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company is continually seeking ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
risks associated with forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all references are to fiscal years unless otherwise noted 
the forward looking statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to certain matters involve risks and uncertainties  including anticipated financial performance  business prospects  anticipated capital expenditures and other similar matters  which reflect management s best judgment based on factors currently known 
actual results and experience could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to those discussed in this form k 
forward looking information provided by the company pursuant to the safe harbor established under the private securities litigation reform act of should be evaluated in the context of these factors 
in addition  the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
see notes e and f to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors 
such commitments generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef and seafood vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies  would not be material
