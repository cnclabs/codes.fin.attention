year issue the year statement which follows is a year readiness disclosure  pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act  public law no 
please note that for purposes of any action brought under the securities laws  as that term is defined in section a of the securities exchange act of usc c a  the year information and readiness disclosure act does not apply to any statements contained in any documents or materials filed with the securities and exchange commission  or with federal banking regulators  pursuant to section i of the securities exchange act of usc l  or disclosures or writing that when made accompanied the solicitation of an offer or sale of securities 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software and embedded system failures 
specifically  computational errors and system failures are a known risk with respect to dates after december  the company has established a central yk compliance office that reports directly to the chief information officer 
each of the company s operating units have also designated information technology it personnel to address the issues that the unit faces and to report to the central yk compliance office 
the company has implemented a system which allows it to track all it and non it systems and facility functions for compliance with industry yk standards 
this tracking system allows the company to monitor and track each functional point as a single item grouped by how critical the item is in the company s ability to perform its daily functions 
based on the output from this data and an analysis of the system reports  the company believes that all functional points which are critical to the company s functions have been identified and assessed 
further  the company has developed a remediation plan for each item in this critical list 
part of the company s remediation strategy is in concert with its efforts to acquire or develop new and innovative systems for its internal operations 
it issues the company is moving all of its it systems into a state of readiness for the year the company believes that it is making satisfactory progress to ensure that it will be ready with all critical it systems by the end of june the functional points that are defined as critical it issues include internal and external computer systems for revenue generating applications 
the company has developed a strategy for its mission critical internal systems designed to have every functional point year compliant by the end of june these internal systems represent approximately of the overall effort in the it applications area 
the remaining of the overall effort in the it area is in the interface and integration of external client and vendor application systems 
the company has implemented a three step process of contacting significant vendors and clients to request information about the status of their yk compliance efforts 
in addition to communicating with significant vendors  the company is testing certain critical vendor application systems for yk compliance 
the company has started an initiative that will identify mitigation and contingency plans at both the business and technical it levels 
this initiative is scheduled to be completed by july  in addition to communicating with significant clients  the company s strategy to deal with non compliant external client customer data is a windowing technique that will enable such data to be used by the company s systems 
non it issues facilities non it issues  with few exceptions  have been classified into a non critical category 
the few exceptions include dial tone for the company s telephony and power from the company s energy providers 
the company has included these functional points in the critical category for purposes of scheduling 
based on communications with providers of these services  the company believes that these services will not be interrupted by year failures 
the company s contingency plan for the loss of power includes generator systems in the company s major facilities 
the company s contingency plan for loss of dial tone includes the distribution of network services across several providers 
this will allow the company to minimally maintain its service levels in the event of a failure 
the company believes that it is making satisfactory progress to ensure that all facility related issues that are material to operations will be compliant by the end of june phases the company is employing a four phase  nine process step project methodology that covers each aspect of yk compliance 
the four phases are phase assessment phase remediation phase verification and testing phase implementation each process step is necessary within the framework and provides clear management checkpoints for gauging the progress of activity during execution of the project plan 
the following table outlines the phases and process steps phase phase phase phase verification process steps assessment remediation testing implementation recognition awareness x x x x inventory x evaluation x determination x remediation x re engineering x multi level testing x x x x implementation x post implementation x the company has clearly defined each of the process steps in the project methodology 
the recognition awareness step included communication of the yk issues and their importance throughout the company 
the inventory step included the identification and cataloging of each item that must be verified for compliance with yk processing 
the evaluation step involves the evaluation and categorization of the critical nature of each item based on established criteria 
the determination step includes making informed management decisions regarding the strategy to be taken for each individual item 
the remediation step involves repair of all components of a process that could improperly process dates 
the re engineering step consists of rewriting and or replacing whole units of software code 
the multi level testing step involves the development of detailed testing criteria and the implementation of those testing plans 
the implementation step involves the coordination of the release of applications systems into the live systems environment 
the post implementation step will include the on going monitoring of applications systems that have been repaired and placed into the live systems environment 
the company has completed the recognition awareness and inventory process steps and nearly completed the evaluation process steps for all items 
the company estimates that approximately of all items are completed 
completed items are either compliant  will be retired prior to  or are low priority items that do not affect business and will be addressed at a later time work around processes will be implemented 
in addition  the company estimates that another of all items that the company believes it needs to complete to be yk compliant are in process steps within phase remediation  and a small number of items are in phases and costs of yk compliance the company currently estimates that the costs to become yk compliant will approximate million 
the company currently anticipates that approximately of these costs will be for hardware and software and the remainder will be primarily internal personnel costs 
the company estimates that it has incurred less than million of these costs through december  the estimated hardware and software costs are included in the company s definition of yk costs in cases where such expenditures have been accelerated in order to address yk issues 
these are the company s current cost estimates and they may change  perhaps materially 
risks there are many risks associated with the year issue  including without limitation the possibility that the company will be unable to receive client phone calls or that the company will be unable to initiate phone calls on behalf of its clients 
such possibilities could have a material adverse effect on the company depending on the nature of the cause and the speed with which it could be corrected or an alternative implemented 
if the company s service providers are unable to provide network switching capability  the company will be unable to perform its revenue producing activities 
if the company s client customer data does not have year compliant dates  additional processing will be required before revenue producing activities using these data can be performed 
if internal systems or vendor application systems fail  the company will be unable to perform revenue producing activities until such time as the problem can be isolated and repaired 
the company believes that its critical internal systems and procedures will be ready and tested before the year the company believes that its reasonably likely worst case scenarios will revolve around external factors including vendors and clients 
although the company expects to focus approximately of its efforts in the it area on this external exposure  the company has far less control over these issues 
it is reasonably likely that not all of the company s clients will have all of their internal systems year compliant before january  as additional verification of readiness  the company has contracted for an external follow up review of all work that has been done to date 
this work  which has already begun  will include an independent third party review of all phases in every region of the company 
this project is being undertaken to verify readiness as well as identify areas of additional need 
the costs of the project and the dates on which the company plans to complete the yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  the company s ability to implement compliance in certain critical areas and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
the severity of problems to be confronted by the company for partial or complete non compliance will depend on a variety of factors such as the nature of the resulting problem and the speed with which it could be corrected or an alternative implemented which are currently unknown 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of vendors and clients  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience quarterly variations in its results of operations principally due to the timing of clients teleservicing campaigns and the commencement and terms of new contracts  revenue mix  and the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support new business 
the company experiences periodic fluctuations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion into a new region and the implementation of clients teleservicing activities 
in addition  the company s business tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe and  to a lesser degree  in the first quarter due to the changeover of client marketing strategies which often occurs at the beginning of the year 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on the company s operations in the future

the standard is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company anticipates adopting this accounting pronouncement in the third quarter of  however  management believes that it will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
