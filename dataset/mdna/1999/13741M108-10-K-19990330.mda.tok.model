item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general candlewood owns  operates  manages  develops and franchises hotels serving mid market extended stay business travelers 
our overall results of operations and financial position are significantly influenced by our development activity 
the following table sets forth our hotel development for the past three years number of hotels december  open hotels company operated franchised total under construction company owned franchised total under contract company owned the following is a summary of hotel openings by quarter for first second third fourth as of quarter quarter quarter quarter as of company operated at the end of  we had a total of company operated hotels and nine franchised hotels located in different states 
we expect to complete the construction of the facilities under construction at december  at various times during the contracts into which we enter for the purchase of potential hotel sites provide for numerous investigations and other due diligence  including environmental studies and title reports  prior to the closing of the sale 
we have the right to terminate each contract if we are not satisfied with the results of the investigations and due diligence 
we are unable to assure that we will acquire properties or complete the development and construction of hotels or that any such development or construction will be completed on time or within budget 
in addition  if we abandon a contract  we may write off certain costs which would otherwise be capitalized 
in two separate sale leaseback transactions  we have sold and leased back certain of our hotels from hpt  a real estate investment trust 
the provisions of the transactions allow us to operate  as lessee  over a defined lease term  hotels that we developed or will develop 
the transactions were closed in stages  beginning in and ending in early a total of hotels were sold and leased back during for a cumulative sales price of approximately million 
in  we sold and leased back five hotels 
the remaining three hotels were sold and leased back in january the results from operations for both years  and  reflect the transactions 
as a result of the sale leaseback transactions  we have recorded rent expense on the hotels leased back from hpt 
as the hotels are leased and not owned  the financial statements do not reflect any depreciation and amortization or interest expense for these hotels after the date of sale 
the proceeds from the sale of the hotels is recorded net of the deferred gain on sale 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the gain must be deferred and not recognized into earnings until certain operating performance levels are achieved 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth our operating property portfolio as of december  and in thousands number of hotels number of rooms december december increase increase company owned   leased   total    franchised  total system    our results of operations were negatively impacted by our early adoption of statement of position sop during the fourth quarter of sop requires opening and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
our opening costs capitalized  net of accumulated amortization  at december   totaled million 
our results are dependent upon our revenue per available room revpar which is a factor of occupancy and room rate 
accordingly  we intend to remain focused on  occupancy levels at each of our hotels until such time the occupancy levels reach stabilization 
due to our rapid expansion  the overall occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the pre stabilization period for newly opened facilities 
this negative impact on occupancy is expected to diminish as the ratio of new property openings during a period to total properties in operation at the end of the period decreases 
once our hotels occupancy levels have stabilized  we intend to review the nightly pricing rates of our hotels 
we believe that this practice is a prevailing standard in the lodging industry 
on august   we completed the private placement of million of our series b preferred stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
the net proceeds to us were approximately million  after deducting commissions and expenses of million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  hotel operations hotel operations revenue the following is a summary of and hotel operations revenues in thousands fiscal year number fiscal fiscal percentage opened of hotels revenues revenues increase change   n a total    hotel operations revenue  which includes room revenue and other revenue eg guest telephone  vending  pay per view movie rental  totaled million for  compared to million for the increase in revenue reflects the increase in the number of hotels in operation during and the full year impact of the hotels opened in the following table sets forth our operating statistics for and for the year ended december  change occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room average occupancy rate  which is determined by dividing the number of guest rooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of guest rooms available for the period  was for  compared to for the increase in occupancy was largely due to the increased number of hotels that had completed or were near completion of their ramp up phase at december  the average daily room rate in was  compared to for average daily room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period 
the increase in average daily rate was largely due to our entry into higher priced markets 
we believe that the average daily room rates vary due primarily to i stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  ii higher rates for our one bedroom suites  and iii higher rates in certain hotel locations 
revenue per available room  calculated as the average occupancy rate multiplied by the average daily rate  was for  compared to for future occupancy and room rates may be impacted by a number of factors  including the number and geographic location of new hotels  as well as the season in which such hotels open  competition  market acceptance of our hotels and general economic conditions 
we cannot predict whether current occupancy and room rates can be maintained 
we consider a property to have completed its initial ramp up phase somewhere between six and twelve months following hotel opening 
the initial ramp up phase is dependent on the supply demand characteristics of individual markets and is most evident in the occupancy of the hotel 
the following table compares the and performance of the hotels open at december  for the year ended december  change occupancy average daily rate revenue per available room hotel operating expenses hotel operating expenses for totaled million  compared to million for hotel operating expenses consist of all expenses directly applicable to the operation of the hotels 
the largest portion of hotel operating expenses was made up of salaries  wages and fringe benefits 
the balance of hotel operating expenses was comprised of normal operating items  such as utilities  property taxes  insurance  supplies  promotional materials  maintenance items and similar expenses 
the increase in hotel operating expenses is largely due to the increased number of hotels in operation during in addition  the variable nature of many of the expenses factors into the overall increase in hotel operating expenses 
for example  labor  utilities  and cleaning supply costs increase as occupancy at the hotels increases 
rent expense on leased hotels we incurred rent expense in of million for the hotels leased as of december  we recorded  of rent expense in for the five hotels leased as of december  the increase in rent expense reflects the sale and leaseback of additional hotels in  as well as the full year lease costs of the hotels sold in hotel depreciation and amortization hotel depreciation and amortization expense eg building  furniture  fixtures  equipment and capitalized opening costs for  totaled million  compared to  for the increase was a direct result of the increase in the number of company owned hotels open and operating during an additional factor in the growth in hotel depreciation was the age of the hotels in the portfolio at december  many of our hotels opened in the fourth quarter of and as a result  only a partial year s depreciation was recorded in as for  depreciation and amortization expense does not reflect any expense for the properties sold in the sale leaseback transactions 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we do not depreciate assets held for sale 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from three to forty years 
corporate operations other income other income for  totaled  compared to  for other income consists primarily of franchise fees and royalty fees from franchise hotels  management fees received from a managed hotel cambridge suites  located in wichita  kansas and equity income from a joint venture hotel in rockford  illinois 
at december   we had nine franchised hotels in operation  compared to three hotels at december  the growth in other income in  compared to reflects an increase in royalty  franchise fee and management fee income  partially offset by our equity in the net loss of the rockford  illinois joint venture hotel 
in addition  we sold additional hotels as part of the sale leaseback transaction during the total sales price for these hotels was million 
a deferred gain of million was recorded on the sales 
in  we recognized  of the gain on hotels sold in and there was no gain recognized during corporate operating expenses corporate operating expenses for totaled million  compared to million for and included all expenses not directly related to the development or operations of specific hotels 
the largest portion of corporate operating expenses consisted of salaries  wages and fringe benefits 
the balance of other corporate operating expenses was comprised of normal operating costs  such as office space lease  travel  utilities  advertising  professional fees and similar expenses 
the increase over the prior period is principally attributable to the salaries  wages  fringe benefits and travel for additional employees required to support our increase in hotels in operation  under construction and properties on which we performed due diligence 
abandoned site costs we recorded million of abandoned site costs in  compared to  in abandoned site costs represent costs related to certain development sites under purchase options that we have decided not to develop 
many of these sites were under purchase option contracts 
corporate depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization applicable to corporate operations for totaled  compared to  for and related to the furniture  equipment and intangible assets at the corporate office 
the increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the increase in furniture  fixtures and equipment required as the corporate office support staff expanded to meet our growth needs 
depreciation expense is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  ranging from three to twenty years 
amortization expense for intangible assets eg operating rights  trademarks is computed using the straight line method over the life of the corresponding asset 
interest income and expense we earned million of interest income in this income resulted primarily from short term investment of excess funds received in the series a and b preferred stock private placements 
for  we earned million of interest income related to the temporary investment of excess funds that stemmed from the initial public offering of our common stock  the series a preferred stock offering  and the sale leaseback transaction 
we had interest expense  net of capitalized interest  of  for  compared to  for the increase in interest expense was the result of our slowdown in development activity in the fourth quarter of we began construction of fewer projects in the fourth quarter thereby limiting the amount of interest that could be capitalized

we recorded  of abandoned site costs in there were no abandoned site costs in corporate depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization applicable to corporate operations for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  in the increase in depreciation and amortization reflected the increased needs of the corporate office staff as it expanded to accommodate our growth 
interest income and expense we earned million of interest income in  compared to  in this income resulted primarily from short term investment of excess funds  including proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock  our offering of series a preferred stock  and the sale leaseback transaction 
we had interest expense  net of capitalized interest  of  in  compared to  in the increase in interest expense reflects the increased level of activity in liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and million at december  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million of net cash used in operating activities in for  we recorded a net loss of million  which includes a million write off of opening costs related to abandoned sites 
one of the primary uses of cash in was related to the million of deposits relating to the sale leaseback of certain of the company s hotels 
sources of cash in included a reduction of million in the amount of hotels held for sale  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and million of non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
the primary use of cash in related to the million of hotels held for sale at the end of the year pursuant to the sale leaseback transaction 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million in our expenditures for property and equipment in connection with the completed hotels  the construction of new hotels  acquisition costs for properties under contract  and the costs of hotels sold accounted for the majority of the cash used 
in  we expended approximately million on construction  compared to million in in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared to million in for  the cash provided by financing activities included the million in proceeds from the series b preferred stock issuance and proceeds from mortgages and notes payable 
in  the cash provided by financing activities was related to proceeds from mortgages and notes payable and the closing of the series a preferred stock placement 
at december   we had hotels under construction with a total estimated cost of approximately million 
our total equity requirement for these properties is million  all of which had been funded as of december  at december   we had secured financing on nine hotels in the amount of million and were processing loans with a third party lender with respect to the three remaining properties which  if approved  would provide an estimated million of additional financing 
as of march   one of the loans in the amount of million had been secured 
in addition to hotels under construction  we had properties under contract at december   with an estimated total project cost of million 
as of december   we had incurred costs of approximately million on these projects 
these costs include deposits and fees for surveys  legal services  environmental studies  and architectural drawings 
we believe that a combination of our cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  borrowed funds from third party lenders if approved on an individual basis and construction loan guarantees from doubletree will be sufficient to provide capital for development of projects currently under construction and operations through substantial capital resources in addition to those discussed above will be necessary for us to continue to develop the properties under contract 
in addition  from time to time we will consider strategic acquisitions as a means of growth  which would similarly require additional capital 
we are actively pursuing a number of financing alternatives  including credit facilities  the issuance of debt and joint ventures 
we are unable to assure that we will be able to obtain financing on a timely basis  on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  losses of deposits or other committed capital  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
dividend payments on the series a and series b preferred stock are paid quarterly and in preference to the common stock 
these payments are approximately million per quarter 
after payment of dividends on the series a and series b preferred stock  we intend to retain any future earnings for reinvestment in the development and expansion of our business 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
we have established a plan to resolve the year issue 
the plan consists of four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
a 
assessment we have completed our assessment of all systems  both information technology and non information technology  that could be significantly affected by the year issue 
the results of the assessment of our systems are as follows our core financial systems all hardware and software were replaced in as part of the successful implementation of a new accounting system 
the new system has been certified to be fully compliant with the year issue by an independent agency 
other corporate office systems  including the local area network  phone systems  e mail  imaging systems  word processing  spreadsheets  and scheduling software have all been evaluated and tested and found to be in compliance 
hotel property management system our initial assessment found our property management system not year compliant 
national guest systems has written an upgrade to the is software to make it year compliant 
this upgrade was installed in the hotels in january of national guest systems has represented to us that the software is now fully compliant 
we will perform further testing on this software in phase two of our plan 
other hotel systems purchased from third party vendors these systems include the elevators  voice mail  energy management and hvac system  phone switches  room key systems  fire and security systems  and any other equipment or systems that have an embedded chip that records the date 
we have requested and obtained written verification from all of our major vendors that their product is year compliant 
furthermore  the plans given to our contractors specify that all systems are year compliant 
b 
remediation as previously mentioned  our assessment indicated that only one of our systems was not year compliant 
this is our property management software purchased from national guest systems 
national guest systems has since modified the software  adding a four digit year instead of the two digit previously used 
this modification has been installed in our hotels and is currently in use 
national guest systems has represented to us that the software is now fully year compliant 
no other issues have been detected in any of our systems 
c 
testing the testing phase of our plan involves actually using the software with dates into the next year and testing the results 
we have begun this testing on personal computers in our corporate office and will expand our tests to the field systems  including the property management system  during the second quarter of as of december   this process was complete 
we anticipate completion by september  we anticipate that this will allow sufficient time to remedy any problems that we identify 
d 
implementation the final phase of our plan is scheduled to be complete by september  all systems will be modified  tested and in place by that date 
to date the only costs we have incurred as a result of the year issue have been the internal costs of labor to perform the assessment and testing of our systems 
we do not anticipate incurring any other costs as a result of the year issue 
we estimate that the total amount of internal labor incurred by us to assess  remedy and test the systems will be less than we have contingency plans for certain critical applications and are working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  data back up and retrieval  manual workarounds and adjustments to staffing strategies 
failure to address the year issue by third party vendors that we rely upon could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
examples of third party vendors include utility providers  elevators  phone service providers  banks and data processing providers 
disruptions in the operation of airlines and central reservation systems  as well as a general disruption in the national or regional economy would also have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
we are unable to estimate the likelihood or impact of these events 
impact of new accounting standards in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued a statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the sop requires that entities expense costs of start up activities as they are incurred 
except for certain entities  this sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the initial application of the sop is to be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
opening costs capitalized  net of accumulated amortization  at december   totaled million 
we elected to early adopt the sop in the fourth quarter of  at which time a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million was recorded 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a portion of our outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on libor 
if interest rates change by 
percent  the market value of our mortgages and notes payable would change by approximately  additionally  we have market risk on our short term investments  which are considered cash equivalents  due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase by 
percent  the market value of our short term investments  based on the outstanding balance at december   would change by approximately  special note regarding forward looking statements investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this document as well as some of our statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements of our officials during presentations about the company are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature  which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions  which include words such as believes  anticipates  estimates  expects or similar expressions 
in addition  any statements concerning future financial performance  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible future actions  which may be provided by our management  are also forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions about our company  economic and market factors and the industry in which we do business  among other things 
these statements are not guaranties of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements 
actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward looking statements due to a number of factors 
the principal important risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward looking statements  include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in national or local economic conditions  competition from other lodging properties  changes in real property tax rates  changes in the availability  cost and terms of financing  the impact of present or future environmental legislation  the ongoing need for capital improvements  changes in operating expenses  adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies  civil unrest  acts of god  including earthquakes and other natural disasters which may result in uninsured losses  acts of war  and adverse changes in zoning laws 
certain of these factors are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including without limitation under the captions certain business considerations  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and business and properties
