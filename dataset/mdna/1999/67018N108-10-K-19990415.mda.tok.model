subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by cautionary statements in this form k and in other reports we filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
overview we are engaged as a manufacturer and supplier of high performance information storage solutions  including external raid redundant array of independent discs subsystems  network attached storage  data storage enclosures  storage management software solutions and adaptiveraid technology 
we design  manufacture and sell high performance fault tolerant data storage solutions supporting a variety of operating system environments for a wide range of customer requirements 
our company has grown through several acquisitions see note to consolidated financial statements  the first of which occurred in june when we acquired the raid business from seagate peripherals  inc in december  we acquired substantially all the net assets of parity systems  inc the parity acquisition 
in april  we acquired borg adaptive technologies  inc borg 
allocations have been made to reflect the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired resulting in asset bases which differ from those of the previous owners 
in addition  certain operating policies and accounting procedures are different from those of the previous owners 
accordingly  comparative financial data of the acquired businesses for periods prior to the acquisitions are not presented in this section since they would be neither comparable nor informative 
prior to the first acquisition in june  our only assets were securities issued by imnet systems  inc imnet see note to consolidated financial statements  which we had acquired in october in exchange for substantially all of the company s operating assets 
during the time in which we owned the imnet securities  our only activities consisted of monitoring our investment in imnet and evaluating potential business opportunities 
as a result of declining sales during  we undertook an initiative to eliminate positions no longer needed and to increase operating efficiencies 
this strategy resulted in significant workforce reductions  a realignment of certain operating expenses and the elimination of certain less profitable products 
as a result  in july we announced that we would focus on our core storage technology and executed an orderly transition to phase out all non storage related businesses  including our memory division 
effective october   we sold to an unrelated party our integrated systems division which installed and supported enterprise resource planning manufacturing software for a net sales price of  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of sales 
year ended two months december  ended year ended december  october  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development depreciation and amortization income loss from operations interest expense income net income loss before income taxes a a percentage of income before income taxes excludes gains from non recurring transactions such as the gain reported from the sale of imnet systems  inc stock of  and the extraordinary gain from debt extinguishment of  comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  the company reported a net loss applicable to common stock of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million from the year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million during the preceding year  a decrease of million or 
factors contributing to this sales decline included i delays in customer deliveries and in some cases  missed sales orders in early  caused by our inability to meet customer production schedules brought about by our cash flow difficulties at that time  ii lost sales opportunities while reorganizing and training our sales force under new executive sales management  and iii entering with a significantly lower balance of sales orders than were in place as of the beginning of another significant factor was a million decrease in non storage related product sales  including memory products and enterprise resource planning manufacturing software software  as a result of our decision to phase out our non storage related businesses 
the following table sets forth sales by product type in thousands storage   memory  software   our company s sales growth in is dependent on our ability to develop and market new products  expand the applications of existing products into targeted market sectors and expand our sales distribution channels through the addition of new distributors  value added resellers and manufacturers sales representatives 
cost of sales gross profit gross profit decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the previous year 
our gross profit is dependent  in part  on product mix which fluctuates from time to time 
the decline in gross profit is primarily due to a decreased sales level of products with overall higher margins and certain cash flow difficulties which limited our ability to purchase products in the most cost efficient manner 
excluding additions to inventory reserves  the overall gross profit for would have been as compared to for we expect our gross profits to improve during partially due to the elimination of certain products with lower gross profits 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of sales and million of sales for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the 
million decrease is principally attributable to overall reduced spending levels resulting from planned cost reductions  primarily advertising and travel  which were implemented as a result of the lower sales levels 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales increased during principally attributable to the level of certain fixed costs we incurred while sales levels declined 
we do not expect selling  general and administrative expenses to significantly increase in the near future  except to the extent that sales commissions and other marketing costs may increase due to increases in sales revenue 
research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  and remained relatively unchanged from the preceding year 
certain of these expenses decreased as a result of the continued integration of previously acquired engineering activities 
this decrease was offset by increased engineering staffing and related overhead of 
million resulting from the borg acquisition in april  and increased project costs in connection with the development of new products 
we believe that considerable investments in research and development will be required to remain competitive and expect that these expenses will increase in future periods 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are substantially incurred in advance of related sales  or in certain situations  may not ultimately generate sales 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased 
million for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily due to additions to test equipment and computer software 
interest expense interest expense in increased 
million over as a result of a significant increase in net average borrowings and the amortization of loan costs in connection with certain indebtedness see note to consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividends in march  the securities and exchange commission staff the staff announced its position on accounting for preferred stock which is convertible into common stock at a discount from the market rate at the date of issuance 
the staff indicated that a preferred stock dividend attributable to such a beneficial conversion privilege should be recorded for the difference between the conversion price and the quoted market price of common stock at the date of issuance 
accordingly  during we recorded  as an embedded dividend attributable to the beneficial conversion privilege  including  on our series b convertible preferred stock and  on our series a convertible preferred stock see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for the year ended december   all classes of our convertible preferred stock required cumulative dividends at and aggregated  absent significant conversions to common stock  such dividends are expected to increase as a result of a full twelve months dividends in on certain classes that were issued in september and october comparison of fiscal years ended december  and october  we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the year ended october  for the two month transition period ended december   we reported a net loss of  results of operations for fiscal included a gain of  resulting from the disposition of of our investment in imnet see note to consolidated financial statements and an extraordinary gain of  on extinguishment of debt see note to consolidated financial statements 
sales sales increased to million for fiscal from million for the year ended october  from january  until our initial acquisition of the raid business in june  there were no sales reported by our company 
accordingly  the year ended october  included sales for the initial five months of operation of the raid business and does not include sales generated from the parity acquisition effective december  sales for the two month transition period amounted to million and included only one month of sales resulting from our company s parity acquisition 
sales levels were adversely affected during by delays in completing the integration of our new product cre raid subsystem 
we were dependent upon the development of a third party controller product that was delivered to us more than six months late which resulted in reduced sales volume and pricing for our cre subsystem 
we also suffered disruptions in manufacturing associated with the transfer and integration of production from california to florida after the parity acquisition 
cost of sales gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended october  gross profit for the two month transition period ended december  was at 
our gross profit is dependent  in part  on product mix which will fluctuate from time to time 
reduced gross profit for is primarily the result of an approximate million write down of inventory resulting from our revaluation of certain inventory acquired in the parity acquisition  potential obsolete inventory  transitional issues associated with the implementation of a new materials requirement planning system  lower sales volume and sales prices for our storage subsystems and overall lower margins from the sale of our memory products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased to million of sales from million of sales for the year ended in october  this increase was primarily the result of twelve months of operations in as compared to only five months included in fiscal  the latter period excluding the parity acquisition effective december  the most significant increase in expenses resulted from compensation and related benefits of additional employees brought about by the parity acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  amounted to million  representing of sales as compared to the year ended october  when expenses were 
million or of sales 
the increase in research and development expenses was principally the result of twelve months of operations in as compared to only five months included in fiscal  costs associated with redesigning  standardizing and obtaining agency certification for new product development and expenses associated with preparation for our anticipated future growth 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to 
million for the year ended december  from 
million for the year ended october   principally due to only five months of expense included in liquidity and capital resources consolidated statements of cash flows operating activities net cash used by operating activities amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the most significant use of cash for both fiscal years was our loss from operations before changes in assets and liabilities of million in and million in in addition  net cash was used by a million decrease in our accounts payable and other liabilities in and a million increase in our inventories in investing activities net cash used by investing activities for the years ended december  and amounted to 
million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from additional investments in property and equipment 
cash used by investing activities for acquisitions for the year ended december   the two month transition period ended december  and the year ended october  amounted to 
million  million and 
million  respectively 
in addition  during the year ended october   we received approximately million cash from the sale of our imnet systems  inc stock see note to consolidated financial statements 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for amounted to approximately million  and primarily consisted of net borrowings of million including million subsequently converted into convertible preferred stock  million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock net of million we used to redeem a prior issuance of convertible preferred stock and million from the exercise of stock warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities for amounted to million  consisting of million in borrowings  less million used as restricted cash under borrowings 
for the two month transition period ended december   net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million principally from the repayment of borrowings in connection with our parity acquisition 
asset based credit facilities in may  we obtained an asset based revolving bank credit facility the revolver  under which we could borrow up to million 
subsequently  we were not consistently in compliance with certain financial covenants of the revolver  however  under amendments to the revolver in december and in february  the bank waived compliance and the maximum borrowings were reduced to  through june  with gradual reductions to million thereafter until maturity on july  the revolver was collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including approximately million reflected as restricted cash at december on august   we repaid the revolver with a replacement asset based revolving credit facility the new revolver which provides for borrowings based on the lesser of million or of the company s eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
the new revolver bears interest  payable monthly  based on prime plus at december   is guaranteed by our company and matures on august  we pay a facility fee equal to per annum on the total facility of million 
advances under the new revolver are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including 
million reflected as restricted cash at december  the loan agreement provides for certain financial covenants including current ratio and net worth requirements  limitations on operating losses and restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  capital expenditures and the payment of dividends  other than preferred stock dividends 
at december   we were not in compliance with the financial covenant concerning our operating losses for  however  effective february   the lender agreed to forbear declaring a default 
financing activities with private investors in late  we determined that amounts available under the revolver would not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and  therefore  additional debt and or equity financing would be necessary 
subsequently  through december   we obtained net cash proceeds of million million in and million in from private investors  consisting of million of convertible preferred stock net of million used to redeem a prior issuance of convertible preferred stock see note to consolidated financial statements  million which was initially in the form of debt and subsequently converted to convertible preferred stock  million of net borrowings  principally subordinated loans the subordinated loans see note to consolidated financial statements  which mature on september   and million received from the exercise of stock warrants 
of these amounts  as of december   h 
irwin levy  chairman of the board of directors and a principal stockholder  and a privately owned corporation controlled by mr 
levy collectively  mr 
levy held million of convertible preferred stock  million of subordinated loans net of million sold by mr 
levy as participation interests and  of short term loans which were repaid in february in addition  in december we received approximately  when mr 
levy exercised warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
through december   mr 
levy also advanced an additional million  which we repaid by december  pursuant to a promissory note  dated march   mr 
levy has agreed to loan us up to an additional million through september  from march  through march   we have borrowed an additional  under that note 
in addition  in february and march  we borrowed million from three unrelated private investors  of which million matures in september and  in june we also received approximately million from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in april  we issued  shares of newly issued common stock to an unrelated private investor for million 
we believe that amounts expected to be available under lending arrangements with financial instiutions  from the proceeds received from issuance of common stock and from mr 
levy will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs during  as presently contemplated 
there can be no assurance  however  that we may not require additional capital beyond our current forecasted needs nor that any such additional required funds would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  at such time or times as required by us 
recent development in march  we entered into an agreement to purchase of the outstanding common stock of andataco  inc andataco from its principal stockholder  david sykes 
that agreement also contemplates we would purchase from mr 
sykes a note in the principal amount of  issued to him by andataco 
following the purchase of mr 
sykes shares  he would continue to serve as president of andataco  pursuant to a proposed three year employment agreement 
the purchase is contingent on our raising the capital necessary to fund the acquisition 
if the transaction is completed  it would be our intention to acquire the remaining andataco shares as soon as possible following an independent professional determination of the fair value of such shares 
we are currently negotiating with unrelated private investors to obtain approximately million in a private placement of convertible preferred stock the private placement 
proceeds from the private placement would be used to finance the proposed andataco acquisition  if consummated  and to provide additional working capital for our company 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in obtaining the funds necessary to finance the proposed acquisition nor that the acquisition will be completed 
effect of inflation during recent years  inflation has not had an impact on our operations and we do not expect that it will have a material impact in recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure them at fair value 
sfas is effective for periods beginning after june  historically  we have not entered into derivative contracts 
accordingly  the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures 
year issue as many computer systems  software programs and other equipment with embedded chips or processors collectively  information systems use only two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  they may be unable to process accurately certain data  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk issue 
the yk issue concerns not only information systems used solely within a company but also concerns third parties  such as customers  vendors and creditors  using information systems that may interact with or affect a company s operations 
the company s state of readiness we have implemented a yk readiness program with the objective of having all of our significant information systems functioning properly with respect to yk before january  the first component of our readiness program was to identify our internal information systems that are susceptible to system failures or processing errors as a result of the yk issue 
this effort is substantially complete and no material issues requiring remediation or replacement have been identified 
the review of our financial systems has been completed and no issues have been identified 
as to the second component of the yk readiness program  we intend to identify our significant customers  vendors and creditors that are believed  at this time  to be critical to business operations subsequent to january  we expect to reasonably ascertain their respective stages of yk readiness through the use of questionnaires  interviews and other available means 
we will take appropriate action based on those responses  but there can be no assurance that the information systems provided by or utilized by other companies which affect their operations will be timely converted in such a way as to allow them to continue normal business operations or furnish products  services or data to us without disruption 
risks if needed remediations and conversions to the information systems are not made on a timely basis by our materially significant customers or vendors  we could be affected by business disruption  operational problems  financial loss  legal liability to third parties and similar risks  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  liquidity or financial condition 
factors which could cause material differences in results  many of which are outside our control  include  but are not limited to  the accuracy of representations by manufacturers of our information systems that their products are yk complaint  the ability of our customers and vendors to identify and resolve their own yk issues and our ability to respond to unforeseen yk complications 
yk costs our total cost of these yk compliance activities has not been and is not anticipated to be material to our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the costs and time necessary to complete the yk modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from the estimates 
our yk readiness program is an ongoing process and the estimates of costs and completion dates for various components of the yk readiness program described above are subject to change
