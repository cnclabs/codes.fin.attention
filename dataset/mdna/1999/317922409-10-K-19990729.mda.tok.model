item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have made forward looking statements in this annual report on form k that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations 
also  when we use such words as believe  expect  anticipate  plan  could  intend or similar expressions  we are making forward looking statements 
you should note that an investment in our securities involves certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in factors that may affect future performance and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
overview finet 
com is a full service  on line mortgage banker that offers an easy to use  one stop mortgage source for consumers and mortgage brokers 
we operate one of the first sites on the internet that enables the consumer to apply for and receive credit approval on line  and to electronically search  analyze and select from a wide variety of mortgage loan products and rates offered by us and other lenders 
we make the mortgage process easier and more understandable  while maintaining quality service by controlling the consumer s entire mortgage lending experience 
we also provide on line and e commerce technologies and loan process management tools to mortgage broker businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with on line and other national lenders and brokers  and help their customers make better informed borrowing decisions 
we earn revenues through both the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
as a retail originator of loans  we generate loan origination income and loan related fees through loans funded and brokered by us 
our loan origination income consists of origination points paid to us by borrowers or discount points paid to us by wholesale lenders 
our loan related fees consist of application  documentation and processing fees paid by borrowers 
on the loans that we sell  we generate revenues from net premium income and interest income 
net premium income consists of the net gain on the sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights 
this net gain is recognized based upon the difference between the combined selling price of the loans and their related servicing rights  on the one hand  and the carrying value of the mortgage loans and servicing rights sold  on the other 
interest income consists of the interest we receive on our mortgage loans held for sale 
our costs and expenses consist largely of interest paid under our warehouse credit facilities  loan related expenses  consisting of fees paid to third parties for appraisal and credit report services and reserves for potential loan repurchase and premium recapture obligations  salaries  commissions and benefits paid to employees  general and administrative expenses such as occupancy costs  office expenses and professional services  and depreciation and amortization expense related principally to our facilities  computers and goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
seasonality affects the mortgage industry because loan originations are typically at their lowest levels during the first and fourth calendar quarters due to a reduced level of home buying activity during the winter months 
loan originations generally increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through october 
as a result  we may report earnings in our fiscal third and fourth quarters that are generally lower than that of the first and second quarters 
however  due to significant refinance activity during and  which was generally affected more by changes in interest rates than by seasons  the expected seasonal patterns are not evident in our historical financial statements 
in the future  our expenses are also likely to vary quarter to quarter based upon fluctuations in the volume of loans we originate due to seasonality and other factors 
economic and interest rate cycles also affect the mortgage industry  as loan originations typically fall in rising interest rate environments 
during such periods  refinancing originations decrease as higher interest rates provide reduced economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgages 
due to stable and decreasing interest rate environments over recent years  our historical performance may not be indicative of results in rising interest rate environments 
in addition  our recent and rapid growth may distort some of our ratios and financial statistics and may make period to period comparisons difficult 
in light of this growth  our historical earnings performance may be of little relevance in predicting future performance 
furthermore  our financial statistics may not be indicative of our results in future periods 
on april   we acquired coastal federal mortgage in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
our results of operations and financial position for the fiscal years ended april  and have been restated to include coastal s results 
coastal s results for years prior to fiscal have not been included in our consolidated results  as they are not meaningful in assessing our historical trends 
on may   we acquired mical in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
mical s results of operations are included in our financial statements since the date of acquisition 
due to significant operating problems and losses at coastal and mical  our new management elected to close both units during fiscal impact of our discontinued units mical  coastal and our servicing business we incurred significant losses at both our mical and coastal subsidiaries during fiscal new management elected to discontinue the businesses of both of these subsidiaries in the last half of fiscal in addition  management determined that servicing loans would not be a part of on going operations and began preparing our servicing portfolios for sale 
the following table summarizes the impact these discontinued business units had on our consolidated operating results for the last three fiscal years fiscal year revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    other expenses general and administrative    marketing and advertising special charges  depreciation and amortization other total expenses    income loss from operations   other interest expense income loss before income taxes   income tax expense net income loss   results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues loan volume increased by million  or  to  million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of a significant increase in the number of loans funded through our mortgage banking subsidiaries  volume attributable to acquired operations  and significant refinancing activity stimulated by relatively low interest rates

income taxes as of april   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset at april  as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of our earnings history 
net loss net loss for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily due to the purchases of mical and coastal  increased marketing expenses associated with the purchase of interloan

marketing and advertising 
marketing and advertising expenses for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased advertising expenses associated with the increased level of loan fundings and the introduction of new products 
special charges 
in fiscal  we recorded special charges of million to writeoff intangible assets that we determined would no longer be employed in future operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for fiscal increased by  to  from  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to depreciation of fixed assets acquired to support increased business activity and staff expansion 
other 
other operating expense for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal this increase resulted primarily from expenses related to the acquisition of mical and coastal 
other interest expense other interest expense for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal this increase was the result of amortization of the imputed interest and debt issuance costs on our convertible subordinated debentures  which were issued in march income taxes as of april   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset at april  as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of our earnings history 
net loss net loss for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and office space in anticipation of growing the business  consulting expenses related to the acquisition of monument in the prior fiscal year  expenses in anticipation of the mical and coastal acquisitions  and intangible asset write downs 
financial condition during our recent operating history we have experienced operating losses and have relied on external sources of debt and equity financing to fund operations  to service debt and to complete acquisitions and capital investments 
capital increases  primarily from private placements of common stock  conversion of debt to equity  and warrant exercises  partially offset by operating losses have increased stockholders equity to million at april  from million at april  in response to our negative operating trends  we have hired new management  including a new chairman and chief executive officer 
the management team s charter is to improve operations and to take full advantage of our technology capabilities  ultimately improving our results from operations and our financial position 
improvement in our financial condition is dependent on our ability to grow our loan origination volumes  to achieve highly efficient operating processes and procedures  and to manage interest expense 
as of march   we returned to more favorable borrowing terms as our primary warehouse lender removed the incremental default interest rates 
our financial condition is further dependent on economic conditions such as the general health of the economy and demand for mortgage loans 
total assets decreased by million  or  to million at april  from million at april  this decrease was due primarily to discontinuing our mical and coastal units and liquidating the mortgages held for sale at both units 
mical was acquired in a purchase transaction in fiscal  and therefore mical s balance sheet was not included in our consolidated balance sheet in fiscal however certain transactions were entered into in anticipation of the acquisition which increased our mortgages held for sale and warehouse borrowing liabilities at april  therefore  year over year changes are affected by fluctuations in mortgages held for sale balances at mical 
the decrease in assets is also due to improved turnover of mortgages held for sale 
warehouse borrowings decreased by million to million at april  from million at april  as proceeds from loan sales were used to reduce the warehouse lines of credit 
million of our convertible subordinated debentures were converted to common stock in fiscal as a result  liabilities decreased by million to million at april  from million at april  liquidity and capital resources the nature of the mortgage lending business requires us to advance cash on a daily basis to fund newly originated loans to our customers 
the majority of these funds are provided through conventional mortgage warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements 
we use cash from our operating activities to invest in mortgages held for sale  to fund ongoing expenses such as administration and marketing  to invest in product development and geographic expansion  and to satisfy debt and other obligations as they come due 
although new operating revenue sources were developed during fiscal  and  cash generated by operations has been insufficient to meet our on going requirements 
therefore  we have employed servicing secured credit facilities and private placements of debentures  common stock and preferred stock as additional resources to meet our operating and investing cash needs 
in fiscal  operating activities used million in cash compared to cash used by operations of million during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  mical ceased originating loans 
coastal ceased originating loans in the first quarter of fiscal we expect that the remaining loans held for sale at mical and coastal will be sold in the first quarter of fiscal we expect that cash flow from the sale of mortgage loans will increase as we intend to increase both fundings and sales through additional marketing and sales efforts in both our business to consumer and business to business segments 
adequate credit facilities and other sources of funding  which permit us to fund mortgage loans  are essential to our ability to close loans through our mortgage banking subsidiaries 
we borrow money to fund our loan closings and repay these borrowings as the loans and the accompanying servicing rights are sold 
upon the sale of loans and servicing rights and the subsequent repayment of the borrowings  our credit facilities become available to fund additional loan closings 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  loan funding was curtailed to reduce the balance of loans held for sale and reduce warehouse line borrowings in response to a default on our warehouse facilities with gmac rfc 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales of loans were accelerated and the warehouse defaults were cured 
warehouse borrowings were reduced to below the committed amounts in accordance with the terms of the warehouse lending extension agreement 
on april   we had two revolving warehouse facilities which were used to finance loans providing us with up to million of demand loans secured by loans held for sale 
loans under the warehouse facilities bear interest at rates that vary from libor plus to libor plus depending on the type of underlying loan  and the loans are subject to sublimits  advance rates and terms that vary depending on the type of underlying loan 
these warehouse facilities require us to comply with various operating and financial covenants 
as of april   our borrowings under our warehouse facilities decreased to million from million as of april  at april   our loans held for sale were million compared to million at april  we have also maintained uncommitted purchase and sale agreements  such as repurchase agreements to fund our mortgages held for sale 
these facilities permit us to diversify our borrowing resources and permit greater origination volumes 
these agreements are not committed facilities and may be terminated at the discretion of the repurchase investor 
under the terms of these agreements  we pledged mortgage loans to obtain additional liquidity pending their sale 
amounts outstanding under these agreements at april  and april  were million and zero  respectively 
our available credit lines also include fannie mae s as soon as pooled early purchase option the asap plus program 
under the asap plus program  fannie mae funds us on the loans we deliver to them upon receipt of appropriate mortgage collateral 
fannie mae subsequently purchases the mortgage loans for cash upon receipt of complete and accurate mortgage pool and other documentation 
while approximately of loans funded by monument mortgage in fiscal were sold to fannie mae  we have not used the asap plus program since fannie mae reinstituted our eligibility on february  after a period of ineligibility due to our financial condition and management structure 
on june   we signed a letter of intent with gmac rfc for a million committed revolving warehouse facility 
our new facility will replace our existing million extended facility with gmac rfc  which we will continue to use until the new facility is available  we received an extension of our current facility which expires on august  the new facility may be used for the origination or acquisition of residential mortgage loans and expires days from closing 
the facility is secured by mortgage loans  which it funds 
funds borrowed under the facility bear interest at libor plus 
our facility agreement contains a number of covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a minimum current ratio  a minimum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
the letter of intent agreement also contains covenants that limit our ability to change executive management  transfer or sell assets  rapidly grow liabilities  pay dividends  enter into transactions with our affiliates  or enter into a merger  consolidate or sell substantially all of our assets 
our revolving warehouse facility provides for events of default typical of facilities of its type 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal increased net repayments of warehouse borrowings  repayments of other debt  the partial redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and the redemption of our preferred stock were offset by the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of common stock through private placements and through warrant exercises 
in may  we received million  net of expenses  from the issuance of the final tranche of our convertible subordinated debenture private placement 
in september  we issued shares of our series a preferred stock in a private placement generating million of proceeds  net of expenses 
during fiscal  we received million from the issuance of common stock in private placements 
the proceeds were used to repay debt and other obligations  to redeem million of our subordinated convertible debentures  to redeem million of our series a preferred stock and to fund operations 
the net proceeds of private placements of common stock completed in the first quarter of fiscal  approximately million  together with cash flows from operations  our existing cash balances and funds available under our revolving warehouse facilities and fannie mae asap program  are expected to be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next months 
we do  however  expect to continue our expansion and expect that eventually we will need to arrange for additional sources of capital through the issuance of debt or equity or additional warehouse facilities 
we have no commitments for any additional financings  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain any such additional financing at the times required and on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
in such event  our growth could slow and operations could be adversely affected 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
investing activities provided cash of  consisting primarily of a reduction in the balance of mortgage servicing rights through sales of million in fiscal we do not intend to purchase additional mortgage servicing rights and have entered into agreements to sell our remaining servicing rights portfolios 
these sales will generate cash for general operating purposes 
our capital expenditures totaled  for fiscal we expect our level of capital spending for fiscal to increase significantly as we improve our information systems investments to support our infrastructure and ensure we are year compliant 
potential for nasdaq delisting there are several requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market nasdaq  including a minimum stock price of per share 
if our common share price closes below per share for consecutive days  we may receive notification from nasdaq that our common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq unless the stock closes at or above per share for at least consecutive days during the day period following such notification 
delisting from the nasdaq and inclusion of our common stock on the otc bulletin board or similar quotation system could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our common stock and make it more difficult for investors to obtain quotations or trade this stock 
in december  we received notice from nasdaq that we had not met required financial ratio criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq 
nasdaq requested that we maintain a minimum net worth of million and complete and submit for its review certain periodic financial reporting until july nasdaq could initiate delisting procedures if we fail to comply 
we have subsequently complied and intend to comply with all special financial reporting requests and ratio criteria required by nasdaq 
year compliance the year issue concerns the ability of automated applications to process date dependent processes  calculations and information by properly interpreting the year 
the year issue could potentially impact our business critical computerized applications relating to  among others  loan origination  servicing  pipeline management  hedging  payroll  financing and financial accounting and reporting 
in addition  other non business critical systems and services may also be affected 
we have assembled a project team composed of consultants  executive personnel and personnel from the information systems  operations and finance departments to assess the readiness of our systems  and the systems of our vendors and suppliers  third party service providers  customers and financial institutions  replace or correct through program changes all our non compliant applications  and develop contingency plans in the event that systems and services are not compliant 
the readiness assessment phase of the project is complete and consisted of a detailed assessment and testing of substantially all internal computer systems 
in addition  we have received  or are seeking  documentation from many external parties indicating their year readiness 
because our loan processing and accounting software are more than two years old and have not been certified as year compliant  we expect to spend up to million on new software  consultants and staff to replace these key systems 
in addition  we expect to spend up to  on testing and remedying our desktop computers and network 
we do not expect any additional costs of making our computer systems year compliant 
the actual cost to become year compliant is subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  among others  our ability to timely identify all affected business critical systems  and the readiness of service providers  vendors and suppliers  financial institutions and significant customers 
we have not been required to defer any information technology projects due to the year issue 
if we are unsuccessful in correcting our business critical systems and processes affected by the year issue  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected 
if our service providers  vendors and suppliers or our financial institutions and significant customers are adversely affected by the year issue  our operations could face substantial interruptions and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
these third party risks include possible interruptions in our ability to fund loans utilizing our warehouse facilities  our ability to sell loans to fannie mae and other investors  our ability to originate mortgages over the internet and our hedging systems ability to link to financial data 
we have contacted each of these parties and are seeking assurance from them that their systems are year compliant 
although we are in the process of developing contingency plans  in the event our key service providers  vendors or suppliers experience year issues  such contingency plans may not be effective 
we do not expect the cost of developing such plans to exceed  although no assurance to that effect can be given 
factors that may affect future performance if we continue to experience losses in the future  our business  financial condition and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we have had net losses in each fiscal year since fiscal  and we expect that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future on both an annual and quarterly basis 
we expect to continue to incur losses because of our plans to invest over the near term in information systems  sales and marketing  recruiting and training  customer support and administrative infrastructure 
because of these expected losses  we may not be able to implement our business plans  and our business  results of operations  financial condition and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
as of april   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
prior to december   our year end financial statements contained a qualification from our independent accountants regarding the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe that it is likely that we will experience losses and accumulate deficits for the foreseeable future 
we may incur additional losses from the discontinued businesses of coastal federal mortgage and mical mortgage 
in april  we acquired coastal federal mortgage company  and in may  we acquired mical mortgage inc  both of which have incurred losses since we acquired them 
in april  we discontinued our coastal and mical business units  and we substantially liquidated their assets 
we recorded a special charge to operations of approximately million associated with these discontinued units 
we reported a net loss associated with their acquisition and operation of million in fiscal we may incur additional unanticipated losses in connection with these discontinued business units 
if our new management is not able to improve and expand our operations  our business could suffer 
we recently replaced most of our management team by hiring  among others  mark korell  our president and chief executive officer  gary palmer  our executive vice president chief financial officer  michael conway  our executive vice president capital markets  thomas porter  our executive vice president administration  kevin gillespie  our executive vice president sales and marketing  and chris skeadas  our executive vice president chief technology officer 
these employees have not previously worked together  and we cannot be sure that they will be able to work together effectively to improve and expand our operations 
if these employees are not able to improve and expand our operations  our financial condition  profitability and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of any of our executive officers or key personnel would likely have an adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel  including  among others mark korell  gary palmer  michael conway  thomas porter  kevin gillespie and chris skeadas 
we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these employees  or other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to retain and attract qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our ability to grow and our future success depend on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing  customer service and professional personnel 
competition for such employees is intense  especially in the e commerce sector  and there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
if we fail to retain and attract the necessary technical  managerial  sales and marketing  customer service personnel and experienced professionals  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely effected 
if consumers and mortgage broker businesses do not embrace on line mortgage financing and sales  our business will be materially adversely affected 
our success depends upon the acceptance of on line mortgage financing by consumers  mortgage brokers and other real estate service providers 
if these groups do not embrace our model for mortgage finance  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the market for electronic mortgage financing  particularly over the internet  is at an early stage of development and is evolving rapidly 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent development and we cannot be sure internet usage will continue to grow or that a sufficiently broad base of consumers and businesses will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium by which to communicate and obtain services traditionally provided in person to person and paper transactions 
our business prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the new and rapidly evolving market for internet products and services 
we believe that acceptance of our products and services will depend on the following factors  among others the growth of the internet as a medium for commerce generally  and as a market for financial products and services in particular  development of the necessary internet network infrastructure to support new technologies and handle the demands placed upon the internet  government regulation of the internet  our ability to successfully and efficiently develop on line products and services that are attractive to a sufficiently large number of consumers and mortgage brokers  and a change in the perception among many consumers and real estate service providers that obtaining a mortgage on line is less dependable than obtaining a mortgage through a more traditional method 
there is a risk that on line mortgage financing will not gain market acceptance and that consumers will not significantly increase their use of the internet for obtaining loans 
if the market for on line mortgage financing fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if there are insufficient communications services to support the internet  it could result in slower response times which would adversely affect usage of the internet 
even if the internet gains acceptance  we may be unable  for technical or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and services or enhancements of existing products and services in a timely manner  and such products and services and enhancements may not gain widespread market acceptance 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because the market for on line mortgage lending is at an early stage of development  the volume of loans that we originate or sell in any given period is difficult to predict 
if the volume of loans that we originate or sell falls below our expectations or the expectations of financial analysts  our business  results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if there is a recession  natural disaster or other disruption in the california economy  our business could be materially adversely affected 
approximately of monument s loans that we originated and or funded in fiscal were for properties located in california 
no other state represented more than of our loan volume during such period 
because a high concentration of our business is in california  we are particularly vulnerable to recessions and conditions affecting the economy of california 
although we seek to originate more loans in other states  we are likely to continue to be dependent on originating loans for properties located in california for the foreseeable future 
there have been times in the past  most recently in and  when the california economy suffered a recession more severe than the rest of the country 
if such a recession were to occur again  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  california historically has been vulnerable to natural disasters  such as earthquakes and mudslides  which are not typically covered by standard hazard insurance policies that homeowners typically maintain 
uninsured disasters may reduce a borrower s ability to repay the mortgage loans we close and sell 
a sustained period of increased delinquencies or defaults resulting from natural disasters could adversely affect the pricing of our future loan sales and our overall ability to sell loans 
the occurrence of any such natural disasters in california could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if there is a decrease in the demand for mortgages  our business could suffer 
demand for mortgages is typically adversely affected by periods of economic slowdown or recession  which can be accompanied by rising interest rates and declining demand for consumer credit  home sales  real estate values and ability of borrowers to make loan payments 
these factors tend to decrease demand for mortgage loans of the types we originate and could increase the rates of delinquencies and foreclosures on loans we hold 
these changes would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
over the last several years we have operated in an environment of relatively low interest rates  relatively high demand for consumer credit and increasing home sales and real estate values 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to grow our business in an atmosphere of higher interest rates  lower consumer credit demand and real estate value and fewer home sales 
if interest rates rise  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our residential mortgage business depends upon overall levels of sale and refinancing of residential real estate as well as on mortgage loan interest rates 
any fluctuation in interest rates or an adverse change in residential real estate or general economic conditions  both of which are outside our control  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the residential real estate industry is highly cyclical 
shifts in the economy and residential real estate values generally affect the number of home sales and new housing starts 
the demand for mortgage loan financing increases as the number of home sales increases 
declining interest rates generally increase mortgage loan financing activity because homeowners refinance existing mortgage loans to obtain more favorable interest rates 
rising interest rates  in contrast  discourage refinancing activities and generally reduce the number of home sales that occur 
approximately of the loans we originated and or funded in fiscal were loans to refinance mortgage debt 
the effect of interest rate changes tends to be greater on the market for refinancing loans than it is on the market for purchase loans  since refinancing a mortgage loan is voluntary and motivated primarily by a homeowner s desire to lower financing costs  whereas new home purchasers are motivated by a need or desire for a new home 
accordingly  the annual volume of new mortgage refinance loans is quite volatile 
we cannot predict future interest rate trends  their impact on our business  or our ability to manage this business mix 
the value of the loans we make is based  in part  on market interest rates  and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if interest rates change rapidly or unexpectedly 
if interest rates rise after we fix a price for a loan but before we sell the loan into the secondary market  the value of that loan will decrease 
if we delay in selling our loans into the secondary market  our interest rate exposure increases and we could incur a loss on the sale 
while we use various hedging strategies to provide some protection against interest rate risks  no hedging strategy can protect us completely 
the nature and timing of hedging transactions influences the effectiveness of hedging strategies and poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than decrease risk 
in addition  hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs 
there is a risk that our hedging strategy and the hedges that we make will not adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility and that our hedges will result in losses 
if we are unable to differentiate ourselves from competition in our industry  our business prospects could be harmed 
the e commerce market is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
barriers to entry are minimal  so our competitors can launch new internet sites at relatively low cost 
in addition  the residential mortgage loan business is highly competitive 
we currently compete with a variety of other companies offering mortgage services  including various on line mortgage brokers  including e loan inc  iown 
com  mortgage 
com  quicken mortgage 
com and keystroke financial  mortgage companies that offer products through on line search engines  such as yahoo and microsoft corporation s home advisor website  mortgage banking companies  commercial banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions which still originate the vast majority of mortgage loans  and mortgage brokers 
many of our mortgage banking and mortgage brokerage competitors have longer operating histories or significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
some of our on line competitors are spending substantial funds on mass marketing and branding their mortgage services 
in addition  some of our competitors offer a wider range of services and financial products to customers and have the ability to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities 
as a result  many have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases and can offer more attractive terms to customers and adopt more aggressive loan pricing policies 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
if we are unable to do so it will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly  the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to continue to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
fluctuation in our quarterly results may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile 
we believe that the following factors  among others  could affect our quarterly results fluctuations in mortgage loan interest rates  seasonal or other economic factors affecting demand for mortgage credit  the volume of our mortgage loan originations  the size and timing of our loan sales  our ability to offer competitive mortgage rates  changes in our pricing policies or our competitors pricing policies for mortgage origination and processing fees  the proportion of our mortgage originations which are used to purchase homes or refinance existing debt  the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  the level of consumer interest and confidence in the internet as a means of accessing financial products and services  the timing of releases of enhancements to our products and services  our ability to upgrade and develop our information systems and operational infrastructure to accommodate growth  the timing and rate at which we increase our expenses to support projected growth  the cost of compliance with federal and state government laws and regulations  including any changes in our historic business practices that could result from legal interpretations  any termination or restructuring of any strategic alliances or agreements with key service providers  such as the federal national mortgage association  commonly known as fannie mae  or the federal home loan mortgage corporation  commonly known as freddie mac  our announcement of new marketing initiatives or strategic alliances with other internet based companies  or termination of any such initiative or alliance  the volume of business resulting from collaborative marketing efforts with our strategic partners  technical difficulties or service interruptions affecting our internet websites or operational data processing systems  changes in our operating expenses and investment in our infrastructure  general economic conditions in the united states and economic conditions which particularly affect e commerce industries  and additions or departures of key executives and operating personnel 
these factors make a substantial decline in our stock price possible at any time 
for example  our common stock traded between and per share between may  and june  in addition  the trading prices of internet and e commerce stocks have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often appear to be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of internet and e commerce companies 
the valuations of many internet and e commerce stocks are extraordinarily high based on conventional valuation standards such as price to earnings and price to sales ratios 
these trading prices and valuations may not be sustained 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of internet or e commerce companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following declines in the market price of their securities 
if litigation of this type were brought against us  it could be very costly and could divert management s attention and resources from our business plan 
we anticipate that as the on line mortgage origination industry matures  our business will also be increasingly susceptible to the same seasonal and cyclical factors that affect the mortgage industry as a whole 
accordingly  we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and our results for any period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
our operating results may fail to meet our expectations or those of analysts who follow us 
any such failure could cause our stock price to decline substantially 
we are aware that from time to time chat groups may develop on the internet and that participants in those groups may post statements about us 
these statements may influence the market price of our common stock 
we do not monitor statements about us that appear on the internet  except for authorized statements made by us 
we undertake no obligation of any kind whatsoever to monitor  correct  comment on or respond to statements on the internet or elsewhere by others  and it is our policy not to monitor  correct  comment on or respond to such statements 
if we are unable to manage growth in our business  our results of operations may not improve 
we anticipate that we will need to rapidly expand our employee base  facilities and infrastructure in order to be able to compete successfully and take advantage of market opportunities 
we expect this expansion to place significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
our current personnel  systems  procedures and controls are not adequate to support anticipated growth of our operations 
to manage this expected growth  we will need to improve our mortgage processing  operational and financial systems  information processing capacity  procedures and controls 
we may be unable to hire  train  retain or manage necessary personnel  or to identify and take advantage of existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
if we are unable to manage expansion of our business effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may not improve and could deteriorate 
problems and risks related to potential acquisitions and alliances may harm our business 
our growth strategy includes acquisitions of or alliances with companies with complementary services  technologies and businesses 
in connection with any such acquisition  we may fail to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company 
for example  as described more completely above under we may incur additional losses from the discontinued businesses of coastal federal mortgage and mical mortgage  we incurred significant losses following our acquisitions of mical and coastal  and have discontinued their operations 
any future acquisitions or alliances we pursue may not be completed or successful 
also  acquisitions or alliances could divert our management s attention from other business matters  or we could lose key employees of acquired companies or alliance businesses 
if we lose key mortgage lender relationships  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we rely on lenders to make loans in cases where we act as a broker 
these lenders are under no obligation to continue their relationships with us or to make a loan to any potential borrower we present to them 
approximately of the loans we originated in fiscal were closed by five lenders 
our reliance on a small group of lenders makes our origination volume more susceptible to changes in the rates  services and products such lenders offer 
the loss of our relationship with any of these lenders  or the failure of these lenders to offer competitive terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the discontinuation of federal programs that purchase loans or any change in our eligibility to participate in such programs would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we fund our mortgage loan operations in part by selling the mortgage loans that we fund to entities such as fannie mae  freddie mac and the government national mortgage association  commonly known as ginnie mae  which pool those mortgage loans into mortgage backed securities 
our ability to sell mortgage loans depends upon the continuation of programs administered by these entities  as well as our continued eligibility to participate in these programs 
if these programs  or our eligibility to participate in them  were terminated or significantly curtailed  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mortgage products offered under these federal programs may change from time to time 
the profitability of specific mortgage products may vary depending on a number of factors  including our administrative costs of originating these products 
we also depend upon private mortgage investors  such as gmac rfc  ge capital mortgage and indymac  to purchase mortgage loans that we originate which do not qualify for inclusion in the federal programs described above 
if private investors reduce their purchases of these mortgage loans  the market and price for such mortgage loans will be adversely affected  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on automated underwriting and other services offered by government sponsored and other mortgage investors  including fannie mae s desktop underwriter  or du  freddie mac s loan prospector  gmac rfc s assetwise and ge capital mortgage s good decisions 
these services help ensure that our mortgage services can be offered efficiently and timely 
we currently have an agreement with fannie mae that allows us to use their automated underwriting services and enables us to sell qualified first mortgages to fannie mae 
during fiscal  approximately of loans funded by monument mortgage were sold to fannie mae 
we expect to continue to process a significant portion of our conforming loans using the fannie mae system 
however  our agreements with fannie mae and other mortgage investors can be terminated by either party immediately upon the delivery of a written termination notice 
there is a risk that we will not remain in good standing with fannie mae and other mortgage investors or that fannie mae and other mortgage investors will terminate our relationship 
the termination of our agreement with fannie mae would materially adversely impact our ability to originate loans 
if our new marketing relationships are unsuccessful  our loan originations could suffer 
we have entered into a majority of our marketing relationships within the past four months 
we expect our new marketing relationships to direct a significant number of prospective customers to our websites 
our agreements with marketing partners are typically short term  lasting as little as days  and  in some cases  can be unilaterally terminated by either party 
if any of these agreements were terminated or lapsed without extension  we could lose an important new source of loan applications 
among our new marketing relationships are those with ask 
com  coxinteractive  getsmart 
com  homehunter  homeseekers and xoom 
com 
if our relationship with these marketing partners or future marketing partners are not successful  or if they are successful but are discontinued for any reason  we could experience a material reduction in the number of loans we are able to originate 
we cannot predict whether any or all of these agreements will be terminated or will be renewed or extended past their current expiration dates 
in addition  if we fail to establish relationships with future website operators or to anticipate and make adjustments in our marketing strategy to access other potential customers  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we have to repurchase loans originated for or sold to lenders  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
under agreements with some of our lenders  they may require us to repurchase loans that we originate for them  or they purchase from us  in the event of material misrepresentations by us or inaccuracies in the borrowers loan documents 
in fiscal  we were required to repurchase approximately  million and  principal amount of loans sold by coastal  mical and monument mortgage  respectively 
it is possible that future demands will be made to repurchase loans sold by these subsidiaries 
there is a risk that we will not have sufficient funds to repurchase loans upon demand or that such repurchases will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of repurchases  we occasionally are required to hold foreclosed residential real estate in inventory until it can be resold 
if interest rates rise and the economy declines  the rate of mortgage loan foreclosures may rise 
depending on the circumstances of the transaction  we may or may not be able to sell the property for more than the outstanding loan balance 
as of april   our mical mortgage subsidiary held approximately million aggregate principal amount of loans in foreclosure 
future foreclosures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we lose access to credit facilities to finance our mortgage lending activities  our growth prospects could be severely limited 
we act as a lender for many of the loans we originate 
because we are not a bank  we are dependent upon specialized mortgage credit facilities from other lenders to finance our mortgage lending activities 
we previously maintained warehouse credit facilities with residential funding corporation  and at times  we have defaulted under such lines of credit 
these warehouse lines have expired  however  we were granted monthly extensions on one of these lines 
the current monthly extension under this line ends on august  we cannot assure you that financing will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all 
to the extent that we are unable to access adequate capital to fund loans  we may have to curtail or cease our loan funding activities entirely 
this would have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth and operating strategies as well as on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if there are interruptions or delays in obtaining appraisal  credit reporting  title searching and other underwriting services from third parties  we may experience customer dissatisfaction and difficulties closing loans 
we rely on other companies to perform certain aspects of the loan underwriting process  including appraisals  credit reporting and title searches 
if the provision of these ancillary services were interrupted or delayed  it could cause delays in the processing and closing of loans for our customers 
the value of the service we offer and the ultimate success of our business are dependent on our ability to secure the timely provision of these ancillary services by the third parties with whom we have business relationships 
if we are unsuccessful in securing the timely delivery of these ancillary services we will likely experience increased customer dissatisfaction and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with extensive federal and state laws regulating our industry  we could be subject to penalties  disqualifications  lawsuits or enforcement actions that could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state authorities 
for example  the united states department of housing and urban development  or hud  regulates certain aspects of the mortgage lending business  as do the federal reserve board and the federal trade commission 
the real estate settlement procedures act of  or respa  the truth in lending act and federal statutes require that certain disclosures  such as good faith estimates of settlement charges  a truth in lending statement and a hud settlement statement be provided to borrowers and that certain information  such as the hud settlement costs booklet  also be provided to borrowers 
the federal fair housing act and the equal credit opportunity act prohibit discrimination and various state statutes prohibit unfair and deceptive trade practices  and impose disclosure and other requirements in connection with the mortgage loan origination process 
if we fail to comply with such regulations  possible consequences could include loss of approved status  demands for indemnification  class action lawsuits  and administrative enforcement actions 
in addition  respa contains certain prohibitions regarding the giving or taking of a fee  kickback  or anything of value for the referral of business to any specific person or organization 
however  the payment of reasonable compensation for the provision of goods  services and facilities is generally not prohibited 
in september  hud cited mical for various alleged violations of hud fha regulations 
thereafter  hud withdrew mical s hud fha title i ii approvals and imposed a civil penalty against mical in the amount of  in california  regulation and licensing of mortgage brokers and lenders falls under the california department of real estate or the california department of corporations 
other than banking industry employees and other persons who are exempt from california department of real estate and california department of corporations licensing requirements  individuals engaged directly in the origination of loans or the dissemination of certain information are required to be licensed by the california department of real estate or the california department of corporations 
we and some of our subsidiaries are also required to be licensed in other states in which we have offices or operate 
although we have the licenses required in california and several other states and believe that we will be able to obtain licenses required in other states from time to time  we cannot be sure that we will successfully comply with the many government regulations and licensing requirements to which we are subject 
if we fail to comply adequately  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if legislation or regulation surrounding the use of the internet restricts our ability to originate mortgages over the internet  our business would be materially adversely affected 
laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet and e commerce may become more prevalent in the future 
in the event the federal trade commission or other governmental authorities adopt or modify laws or regulations relating to the internet  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
such legislation and regulation could dampen the growth in internet usage generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a commercial medium 
the laws and regulations governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative or regulatory action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws and regulations such as those governing intellectual property  privacy and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and regulations  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change in e commerce and improve our products and services  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the internet and e commerce are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render existing technology and systems obsolete 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our on line services 
we have little proprietary computer software  information databases or applications 
we cannot be sure that others will not develop and offer superior products and services  or  if so offered  that they will not gain a greater acceptance among potential customers 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both license and internally develop leading technologies useful in our business  enhance our existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the development of websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully use new technologies effectively or adapt our websites  technology and transaction processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions  customer requirements or emerging industry standards  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if our computer systems fail  our business would be materially adversely affected 
a key element of our strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic on  and use of  our websites 
accordingly  the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our websites  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and maintain adequate customer service levels 
our revenues depend in part on the number of potential customers who visit our websites 
any system interruption that results in the unavailability of our websites would reduce the volume and attractiveness of our product and service offerings 
our communications hardware and some of our other computer hardware operations are located at our facilities in walnut creek  california 
the hardware for our internal loan and product database  as well as our loan processing operations  is also maintained in our walnut creek facility 
fires  floods  earthquakes  power losses  telecommunications failures  breaches and similar events could damage these systems 
computer viruses  electronic breaches or other similar disruptive problems could also adversely affect our websites 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our systems were affected by any of these occurrences 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of a failure of our computer systems or other interruptions in our business 
our websites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information  the accuracy and timeliness of which is critical to our business 
in the past  we have experienced periodic system interruptions  which we believe will continue to occur from time to time 
any substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our websites will require us to expand and upgrade further our technology  transaction processing systems and network infrastructure 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our websites or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases in a timely manner 
in addition  our users depend on internet service providers  on line service providers and other website operators for access to our websites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outage delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
moreover  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support continued growth in its use 
any of these problems would materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our electronic security devices are breached  our business would be materially adversely affected 
the secure transmission of confidential information through e commerce is critical to our underwriting process 
we rely on certain encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information  such as consumers financial statements 
there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we use to protect customer transaction data 
if any such compromise were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet generally  and e commerce in particular 
to the extent that our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as consumers financial statements and profile information  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
there can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent security breaches or that a failure to prevent such security breaches will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to successfully address year issues  our business could be materially adversely affected 
many currently installed computer systems and software programs only accept two digits to identify the year in any date 
any system or program which cannot accept four digits to identify the year in any date may not distinguish dates falling on or after january  from dates falling before january  as a result  many computer systems and software programs may need to be upgraded or replaced to ensure they comply with year requirements 
the actual cost we incur to become year compliant is subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  among others  our ability to timely identify all affected business critical systems  and the readiness of service providers  vendors and suppliers  and our financial institutions and significant customers 
if we are unsuccessful in correcting our business critical systems and processes affected by the year issue  our  business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected 
in addition  if our service providers  vendors and suppliers or our financial institutions and significant customers are adversely affected by the year issue  our operations could face substantial interruptions and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
these third party risks include possible interruptions in our ability to fund loans utilizing our warehouse facilities  our ability to sell loans to fannie mae and other investors  originate mortgages over the internet and our hedging systems ability to link to financial data 
future issuances of additional securities will be dilutive to existing stockholders 
pursuant to contractual obligations to file a registration statement with the sec covering shares of common stock held by some of our existing stockholders  we may be obligated to issue additional shares to such stockholders for failing to file the registration statement within the time specified in the agreements under which the shares were purchased 
if we are required to issue such additional shares  it will result in dilution to the interests of our other stockholders 
in addition  mr 
korell s employment agreement has an anti dilution provision pursuant to which he has the right to maintain a four percent equity position in finet 
com 
the issuance of options to mr 
korell pursuant to this provision will result in dilution to the interests of our other stockholders 
material subsequent events subsequent to april   we received approximately million from the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock in private placements 
we received an extension of our lending agreement from our primary warehouse lender  gmac rfc 
the extension expires on august  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosue about market risk finet s primary market risk of loss is interest rate risk 
from the time we extend an interest rate commitment to the borrower until the loan is priced for sale to an investor  we are subject interest rate risk 
if interest rates rise during that period  the price at which the loan can be sold to an investor declines  resulting in a loss on the sale of the loan 
we attempt to mitigate such losses and manage our interest rate risk exposure through hedging transactions using a combination of forward sales of mortgage backed securities and forward whole loan sales to fix the sales price of loans we expect to fund 
before entering into hedging transactions  we analyze our loans with committed interest rates pipeline loans 
we consider factors such as the estimated portion of loans that will ultimately be funded  note rates  interest rates  inventory of loans and applications and other factors to determine the type and amount of forward commitment and hedging transactions 
finet attempts to make forward commitments for  or hedge substantially  all of its estimated interest rate risk on the loans 
we have mandatory and optional forward commitments at april  and aggregating million and million  respectively 
these commitments covered the market risk associated with mortgage loans held for sale to investors of million and million  respectively  and our pipeline loans for which interest rates were committed at april  and of million and million  respectively 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure on forward sales arrangements by entering into forward sales contracts exclusively with institutions that we believe are sound credit risks and by limiting exposure to any single institution
