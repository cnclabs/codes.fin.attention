funds from operations and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends funds from operations increased by approximately million or in compared to and increased by approximately million or in compared to as a result of the factors discussed in the analysis of operating results above 
management considers funds from operations to be one financial measure of the operating performance of an equity reit that provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits and it is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts definition of funds from operations  the company calculates funds from operations to be equal to net income  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and interest rate protection agreements  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs  including the payment of dividends and distributions

market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical gain or loss in earnings  cash flows or fair value of the financial instruments and derivative instruments which are held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in the interest rates 
while this analysis may have some use as a benchmark  it should not be viewed as a forecast 
in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk and are not represented in the following analysis 
at december   million approximately of total debt at december  of the company s debt was variable rate debt all of the variable rate debt relates to the company s unsecured acquisition facility and  million approximately of total debt at december  was fixed rate debt 
the company also had outstanding a written put and a written call option collectively  the written options which were issued in conjunction with the initial offering of two tranches of unsecured debt 
the company s past practice has been to lock into fixed interest rates at issuance or fix the rate of variable rate debt through the use of interest rate protection agreements when interest rate market conditions dictate it is advantageous to do so 
currently  the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flows of the company 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in the interest rate generally do not impact the fair value of the debt  but would affect the company s future earnings and cash flows 
the interest rate risk and changes in fair market value of fixed rate debt generally do not have a significant impact on the company until the company is required to refinance such debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the maturity dates of the company s various fixed rate debt 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at december   a increase or decrease in the interest rate on the company s variable rate debt would decrease or increase  respectively  future net income and cash flows by approximately 
million per year 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  by approximately million to million 
a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  by approximately million to  million 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the written options at december  by approximately million to million 
a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the written options at december  by approximately million to million

inflation for the last several years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rates in the company s markets of operation 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  many of the outstanding leases expire within five years which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rentals if rents of existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
year compliance the year compliance issue concerns the inability of computerized information systems and non information systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after this could result in computer systems failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects almost all companies and organizations 
the company has discussed its software applications and internal operational programs with its current information systems vendor and  based on such discussions  believes that such applications and programs will properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the company is discussing with its material third party service providers  such as its banks  payroll processor and telecommunications provider  their year compliance and is assessing what effect their possible non compliance might have on the company 
in addition  the company is discussing with its material vendors the possibility of any interface difficulties and or electrical or mechanical problems relating to the year which may affect properties owned by the company 
the company has also surveyed substantially all of its tenants to determine the status of their year compliance and what effect their possible non compliance might have on the company 
the company is currently processing the information obtained from such tenant surveys and remains in discussions with its material vendors and third party service providers 
of the tenant surveys processed to date  all have stated that they are either year compliant or will be year compliant by the end of the company plans to complete its assessment of year compliance by such parties by june  until such time the company cannot estimate any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of tenants  vendors or third party service providers to address their year issues  however  to date  no significant year related conditions have been identified 
because the company s evaluation of its year issues has been conducted by its own personnel or by its vendors in connection with their servicing operations  the company s expenditures for assessing its year issues  though difficult to quantify  to date have not been material 
in addition  the company is not aware of any year related conditions that it believes would likely require any material expenditures by the company in the future 
based on its current information  the company believes that the risk posed by any foreseeable year related problem with its internal systems and the systems at its properties including both information and non information systems or with its vendors or tenants is minimal 
year related problems with the company s software applications and internal operational programs or with the electrical or mechanical systems at its properties are unlikely to cause more than minor disruptions in the company s operations 
the company believes that the risk posed by year related problems at certain of its third party service providers  such as its banks  payroll processor and telecommunications provider is marginally greater  though  based on its current information  the company does not believe any such problems would have a material effect on its operations 
any year related problems at such third party service providers could delay the processing of financial transactions and the company s payroll and could disrupt the company s internal and external communications 
at this time  the company has not developed and does not anticipate developing any contingency plans with respect to year issues 
in addition  the company has no plans to seek independent verification or review of its assessment of its year issues 
the company does intend to complete its assessment of  and to continue to monitor  its year issues and will develop contingency plans if  and to the extent  deemed necessary 
while the company believes that it will be year compliant by december   there can be no assurance that the company has been or will be successful in identifying and assessing year issues  or that  to the extent identified  the company s efforts to remediate such issues will be effective such that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operation
