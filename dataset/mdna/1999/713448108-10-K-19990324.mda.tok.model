item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  cash flows and liquidity and capital resources management s discussion and analysis all per share information is computed using average shares outstanding  assuming dilution 
introduction management s discussion and analysis is presented in four sections 
the introductory section discusses pending transactions events  acquisitions  market risk including the euro conversion  year  impairment and other items affecting comparability of results and a new accounting standard pages 
the second section analyzes the results of operations  first on a consolidated basis and then for each of our business segments pages 
the final two sections address our consolidated cash flows and liquidity and capital resources pages and 
cautionary statements from time to time  in written reports and in oral statements  we discuss expectations regarding our future performance  year risks  pending transactions events  the impact of the euro conversion and the impact of current global macro economic issues 
these forward looking statements are based on currently available competitive  financial and economic data and our operating plans 
they are inherently uncertain  and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be significantly different from expectations 
pending transactions events in november  our board of directors approved a plan for the separation from pepsico of certain wholly owned bottling businesses located in the united states  canada  spain  greece and russia  referred to as the pepsi bottling group 
pursuant to this plan  pbg intends to sell shares of its common stock in an initial public offering and pepsico intends to retain a noncontrolling ownership interest in pbg 
a registration statement relating to the offering has been filed on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
the transaction is expected to be consummated in the second quarter of  subject to market conditions and regulatory approval 
if consummated  the transaction is expected to result in a gain to pepsico  net of related costs 
these related costs will include a charge for the early vesting of pepsico stock options held by pbg employees  which will be based on the price of our stock at the date of the offering 
see management s discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources on page regarding pbg related financing and expected use of proceeds 
in january  we announced an agreement with the whitman corporation to realign bottling territories 
subject to approval by the whitman shareholders and various regulatory authorities  we plan to combine certain of our bottling operations in the mid western united states and central europe with most of whitman s existing bottling businesses to create new whitman 
under the agreement  our current equity interest of in general bottlers  the principal operating company of whitman  will also be transferred to new whitman 
whitman transferred its existing bottling operations in marion  virginia  princeton  west virginia  and st 
petersburg  russia to pbg 
it is planned for new whitman to assume certain indebtedness associated with our transferred us operations with net proceeds to us of million 
upon completion of the transaction  we will receive million shares of new whitman common stock 
whitman has undertaken a share repurchase program and it is anticipated that upon completion of the transaction and the repurchase program  our noncontrolling ownership interest will be approximately 
if approved  this transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of and result in a net gain to pepsico 
the frito lay program to improve productivity  discussed in management s discussion and analysis impairment and other items affecting comparability of results beginning on page  also includes consolidating us production in our most modern and efficient plants and streamlining logistics and transportation systems 
this program is expected to result in additional asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately million to be recorded in the first quarter of acquisitions at the end of the third quarter  we completed the acquisitions of tropicana products  inc from the seagram company ltd 
for billion in cash and the smith s snackfoods company tssc in australia from united biscuits holdings plc for million in cash 
in addition  acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates included the purchases of the remaining ownership interest in various bottlers and purchases of other international salty snack food businesses 
acquisitions for the year aggregated billion in cash 
the results of operations of all acquisitions are generally included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are o interest rates on our debt and short term investment portfolios  o foreign exchange rates and other international market risks  and o commodity prices  affecting the cost of our raw materials 
interest rates pepsico centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios balancing investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
we use interest rate and currency swaps to effectively modify the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the principal  interest payment and maturity dates of the related debt 
accordingly  any market risk or opportunity associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
our investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
the carrying amounts approximate market value because of the short term maturity of these portfolios 
it is our practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by million 
this sensitivity analysis does not take into account existing interest rate swaps and the possibility that rates on debt and investments can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category 
foreign exchange and other international market risks operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rate movements typically affect economic growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  can cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
the discussion of changes in currency below does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
the sensitivity analysis presented below does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category 
international operations constitute about of our consolidated operating profit  excluding unusual impairment and other items 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international operating profit include the mexican peso  british pound  canadian dollar and brazilian real 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by approximately million 
this was estimated using of the international segment operating profit after adjusting for unusual impairment and other items 
we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses arising from the remeasurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
there were net foreign exchange losses of million in  million in and million in during the year  macro economic conditions in brazil  mexico  russia and across asia pacific have adversely impacted our results see russia discussion below 
we are taking actions in these markets to respond to these conditions  such as prudent pricing aimed at sustaining volume  renegotiating terms with suppliers and securing local currency supply alternatives 
however  we expect that the macro economic conditions  particularly in brazil  will continue to adversely impact our results in the near term 
the economic turmoil in russia which accompanied the august devaluation of the ruble had an adverse impact on our operations 
consequently in our fourth quarter  we experienced a significant drop in demand  resulting in lower net sales and increased operating losses 
also  since net bottling sales in russia are denominated in rubles  whereas a substantial portion of our related costs and expenses are denominated in us dollars  bottling operating margins were further eroded 
in response to these conditions  we have reduced our cost structure primarily through closing facilities  renegotiating manufacturing contracts and reducing the number of employees 
we also wrote down our long lived bottling assets to give effect to the resulting impairment 
see management s discussion and analysis impairment and other items affecting comparability of results beginning on page on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
conversion to the euro eliminated currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
our operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and financial systems  business processes and equipment  such as vending machines  to accommodate euro denominated transactions and the impact of one common currency on pricing 
since financial systems and processes currently accommodate multiple currencies  the plans contemplate conversion by the middle of if not already addressed in conjunction with year remediation 
we do not expect the system and equipment conversion costs to be material 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the long term effects one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact  if any  on financial condition or results of operations 
commodities we are subject to market risk with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use futures contracts to hedge immaterial amounts of our commodity purchases 
year each of pepsico s business segments and corporate headquarters has established teams to identify and address year compliance issues 
information technology systems with non compliant code are expected to be modified or replaced with systems that are year compliant 
similar actions are being taken with respect to non it systems  primarily systems embedded in manufacturing and other facilities 
the teams are also charged with investigating the year readiness of suppliers  customers  franchisees  financial institutions and other third parties and with developing contingency plans where necessary 
key information technology systems have been inventoried and assessed for compliance  and detailed plans have been established for required system modifications or replacements 
remediation and testing activities are in process with work on approximately of the systems already completed and the systems back in operation 
this percentage is expected to increase to approximately and by the end of the first and second quarters of  respectively 
pepsico systems are expected to be compliant by the fourth quarter of inventories and assessments of non it systems have been completed and remediation activities are under way with a mid year target completion date 
independent consultants have monitored progress of remediation programs at selected businesses and performed testing at certain key locations 
in addition  other experts performed independent verification and validation audits of a sample of remediated systems with satisfactory results 
other independent consultants also performed a high level review of our year efforts and concluded that there were no significant deficiencies in our process  provided that resources are maintained at their current level and schedules are met 
progress is also monitored by senior management  and periodically reported to pepsico s board of directors 
we have identified critical suppliers  customers  financial institutions  and other third parties and have surveyed their year remediation programs 
we have completed on site meetings with many of the third parties identified as presenting the greatest impact if not compliant 
risk assessments and contingency plans  where necessary  will be finalized in the first half of and tested where feasible in the second half of in addition  independent consultants have completed a survey of the state of readiness of our significant bottling franchisees 
such surveys have identified readiness issues and  therefore  potential risk to us 
as a result  the franchisees remediation programs are being accelerated to minimize the risk 
we are also providing assistance to the franchisees with processes and with certain manufacturing equipment compliance data 
incremental costs directly related to year issues are estimated to be million from to  of which million or has been spent to date 
approximately of the total estimated spending represents costs to repair systems while approximately represents costs to replace and rewrite software 
this estimate assumes that we will not incur significant year related costs on behalf of our suppliers  customers  franchisees  financial institutions or other third parties 
costs incurred prior to were immaterial 
excluded from the estimated incremental costs are approximately million of internal recurring costs related to our year efforts 
contingency plans for year related interruptions are being developed and will include  but not be limited to  the development of emergency backup and recovery procedures  the staffing of a centralized team to react to unforeseen events  remediation of existing systems parallel with installation of new systems  replacing electronic applications with manual processes  identification of alternate suppliers and increasing raw material and finished goods inventory levels 
the potential failure of a power grid or public telecommunication system  particularly internationally  will be considered in our contingency planning 
all plans are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter in our most likely worst case scenarios are the temporary inability of bottling franchisees to manufacture or bottle some products in certain locations  of suppliers to provide raw materials on a timely basis and of some customers to order and pay on a timely basis 
our year efforts are ongoing and our overall plan  including our contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
while we anticipate no major interruption of our business activities  that will be dependent in part upon the ability of third parties  particularly bottling franchisees  to be year compliant 
although we have implemented the actions described above to address third party issues  we are not able to require the compliance actions by such parties 
accordingly  while we believe our actions in this regard should have the effect of mitigating year risks  we are unable to eliminate them or to estimate the ultimate effect year risks will have on our operating results 
impairment and other items affecting comparability of results asset impairment and restructuring charges asset impairment and restructuring charges were million million after tax or per share in  million million after tax or per share in and million million after tax or per share in the asset impairment and restructuring charges of million are comprised of the following o a fourth quarter charge of million for asset impairment of million and restructuring charges of million resulting from the adverse impact of market conditions of our russian bottling operations described in management s discussion and analysis market risks beginning on page the impairment evaluation was triggered by the reduction in utilization of assets caused by the lower demand  the adverse change in the business climate and the expected continuation of operating losses and cash deficits in that market 
the impairment charge reduced the net book value of the assets to their estimated fair market value  based primarily on values recently paid for similar assets in that marketplace 
of the total million charge  million relates to bottling operations that will be part of pbg 
o an impairment charge of million relating to manufacturing equipment at frito lay north america 
in the fourth quarter  as part of our annual assessment of marketing plans and related capacity requirements at frito lay north america and the development of a program to improve manufacturing productivity  we determined that certain product specific equipment would not be utilized and certain capital projects would be terminated to avoid production redundancies 
the charge primarily reflects the write off of the net book value of the equipment and related projects 
o a fourth quarter charge of million for employee related costs resulting from the separation of pepsi cola north america s concentrate and bottling organizations to more effectively serve retail customers in light of the expected conversion of pbg to public ownership 
of this amount  million relates to bottling operations that will be part of pbg 
most of the restructuring related amounts have been or will be paid in in and  asset impairment and restructuring charges of million and million reflected strategic decisions to realign the international bottling system  improve frito lay international operating productivity and exit certain businesses 
in  restructuring charges included proceeds of million associated with a settlement related to a previous venezuelan bottler agreement  partially offset by related costs 
income tax benefit in we reported a tax benefit  included in the provision for income taxes  of million or per share as a result of reaching a final agreement with the internal revenue service to settle substantially all remaining aspects of a tax case relating to our concentrate operations in puerto rico 
new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
we are currently assessing the effects of adopting sfas  and have not yet made a determination of the impact adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations consolidated review general in the discussions below  the year over year dollar change in bottler case sales by company owned bottling operations and concentrate unit sales to franchisees for pepsi cola  and in pound or kilo sales of salty and sweet snacks for frito lay is referred to as volume 
price changes over the prior year and the impact of product  package and country sales mix changes are referred to as effective net pricing 
net sales change b w in millions net sales    net sales rose billion or in excluding foreign currency impact  net sales would have risen 
this increase reflects volume gains in all businesses  net contributions from acquisitions divestitures and higher effective net pricing driven by a shift to higher priced products in frito lay north america 
volume gains contributed percentage points of growth 
net acquisitions divestitures contributed percentage points to the sales growth and primarily reflect the acquisitions of tropicana and certain north american bottlers partially offset by the absence of bottling sales as a result of refranchising a japanese bottler late in in addition  net acquisitions divestitures also include the addition of tssc and certain other international salty snack food businesses which were partially offset by the loss of net sales from previously consolidated businesses contributed to a new frito lay international joint venture in central and south america 
weaker foreign currencies primarily in canada  thailand  brazil  poland and india led the unfavorable foreign currency impact

ongoing operating profit margin declined over percentage point primarily reflecting the margin impact of increased advertising and marketing a m and selling and distribution s d expenses and higher cost of sales partially offset by the impact of volume growth 
a m grew at a significantly faster rate than sales led by increases at pepsi cola worldwide which included the pepsi one launch costs and increases at frito lay north america for promotional allowances and wow launch costs 
s d expenses grew at a slightly faster rate than sales primarily in pepsi cola north america and in frito lay north america  reflecting an increase in our sales forces and higher depreciation  maintenance and labor costs associated with pepsi cola north america cooler and vendor placements 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased due to costs associated with new plants and lines related to wow and doritos d products at frito lay north america and an unfavorable shift from higher margin concentrate business to packaged products in pepsi cola north america

foreign exchange losses  primarily in russia and asia  are reported as part of corporate unallocated expenses 
information technology expense increased on a year over year basis  despite million of software costs that were capitalized as required by sop  driven by our various productivity initiatives and year remediation efforts 
reported operating profit margin increased over percentage points in ongoing operating profit margin increased over percentage point due to the margin impact of volume growth in all businesses  equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates compared to losses in and lower cost of sales 
the impact of these advances were partially offset by the impact of higher s d and g a 
the change in equity income primarily reflects the absence of losses in from our latin american bottler  buenos aires embotelladora sa baesa 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased due to favorable raw material costs in pepsi cola international and the favorable effect of higher pricing partially offset by increased costs for new plant capacity and the planned introduction of new products in by frito lay north america 
the higher s d was driven by increased distribution costs to meet demand 
the increase in g a is due to information systems related expenses  customer focus leadership training and infrastructure costs related to our new fountain beverage sales team 
these increased g a expenses were partially offset by savings from a prior year restructuring and the consolidation of certain administrative functions 
ongoing operating profit margin was also reduced by the absence of gains from the sale of an investment in a u

the increase reflects significant volume growth and contributions from acquisitions  reduced by unfavorable foreign exchange rates with canada and lower effective net pricing 
the increased sales volume was primarily in packaged products 
acquisitions contributed percentage point to the sales growth 
bcs increased  led by the strong single digit growth of the mountain dew brand  contributions from pepsi one our new one calorie cola and strong double digit growth of aquafina bottled water and lipton brisk 
brand pepsi and brand diet pepsi also contributed to this year s growth  both advancing at single digit rates

weaker foreign currencies primarily in thailand  india and hungary led the unfavorable foreign currency impact 
bcs increased reflecting double digit growth in mexico  the philippines  india  pakistan and china 
in addition  bcs grew at a high double digit rate in venezuela reflecting the continued momentum by the joint venture as it increased its territories and capacity 
these advances were partially offset by lower bcs in japan due to the elimination of certain pepsico owned brands by the new bottler suntory 
the pepsico owned brands that continued to be sold by suntory grew at a double digit rate 
total concentrate shipments to franchisees increased at about the same rate as their bcs

total concentrate shipments to franchisees increased at about the same rate as their bcs 
reported operating losses declined million 
ongoing operating results improved by million  reflecting a small profit in compared to a loss in the improvement in ongoing operating results was driven by lower manufacturing costs  reduced net losses from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates and lower g a expenses 
operating results also benefited from the absence of s higher than normal expenses from fourth quarter balance sheet adjustments and actions 
the lower manufacturing costs were primarily due to favorable raw material costs and lower depreciation resulting from certain businesses held for disposal 
the reduced net losses from our unconsolidated affiliates were primarily driven by the absence of losses from baesa

salty snack kilos increased  led by solid double digit growth at sabritas in mexico and the snack ventures europe joint venture  partially offset by double digit declines in brazil 
sweet snack kilos declined driven by a single digit decline at gamesa in mexico and a double digit decline at wedel in poland 
these declines in sweet snack kilos were partially offset by double digit growth at sabritas 
including acquisitions divestitures  salty snack kilos increased to 
the increase of percentage points was primarily driven by the acquisitions through partnership with  as well as  purchase of salty snack food businesses in central and south america 
sweet snack kilos  including the effect of acquisitions divestitures  declined primarily as a result of the first quarter sale of a french biscuit business 
reported operating profit increased million 
ongoing operating profit declined million 
deterioration of operating performance in brazil due to the macro economic conditions and market softness at gamesa was partially offset by growth at sabritas and in poland 
the growth in poland was substantially driven by the sweet snack business 
as part of a global strategy to focus on core businesses  we previously announced that we had completed negotiations for the sales in early of the chocolate and biscuit businesses in poland

the operating profit reflects the impact of fourth quarter increases in the cost of oranges in advance of related selling price increases 
consolidated cash flows vs 
our consolidated cash and cash equivalents decreased billion compared to a billion increase in excluding cash provided by discontinued operations in  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was billion in compared with a billion decrease in the change in cash flow primarily reflects net proceeds from issuance of debt and the liquidation of investment portfolios in compared to net debt repayments in these cash inflows were primarily used to fund acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates during the year 
the acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated affiliates include the purchases of tropicana  the remaining ownership interest in various bottlers  tssc and various other international salty snack food businesses 
vs 
our consolidated cash and cash equivalents increased billion over the prior year reflecting a significant increase in cash provided by discontinued operations which was used to reduce debt  increase our investment portfolios and repurchase shares 
the net cash flow provided by discontinued operations increased billion in the significant increase primarily reflects a billion cash distribution received from tricon just prior to the restaurant spin off 
in addition  the increase reflects after tax cash proceeds of billion associated with the sale of pfs and the non core us restaurant businesses  the effects of refranchising restaurants and other operating activities 
share repurchases our share repurchase activity was as follows in millions cost    shares repurchased number of shares of shares outstanding at beginning of year at december   million shares remain available under the current repurchase authority granted by our board of directors 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of the third quarter  we completed the acquisitions of tropicana for billion in cash and tssc for million in cash 
the purchase prices were largely funded by the issuance of one year notes and commercial paper resulting in an increase in short term borrowings at year end we increased our revolving credit facilities by billion to billion from billion at year end these unused credit facilities exist largely to support issuances of short term debt 
the facilities are composed of billion expiring march and billion expiring march at year end  billion of short term borrowings were reclassified as long term  reflecting our intent and ability  through the existence of the unused revolving credit facilities  to refinance these borrowings 
annually  these facilities can be extended an additional year upon the mutual consent of pepsico and the lending institutions 
as discussed in management s discussion and analysis pending transactions events  our board of directors approved a plan for the separation of pbg 
as noted  an initial public offering is expected to be consummated in the second quarter of subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals 
in february and march of  pbg and its principal operating subsidiary  bottling llc incurred billion of indebtedness  a large portion of which is intended to be temporary and be repaid with the proceeds of the offering 
it is intended that the remainder will be carried as pbg s long term indebtedness of which billion is unconditionally guaranteed by pepsico 
a substantial portion of the debt proceeds obtained by pbg was used to settle pre existing intercompany amounts due to us 
we plan to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of a portion of our short term borrowings 
as noted earlier in the discussion regarding pending transactions  as part of our agreement with whitman to realign bottling territories  certain indebtedness associated with our transferred us operations is planned to be assumed by new whitman with net proceeds to us of million 
capital spending is expected to decline in to approximately billion as we will no longer directly fund the capital spending related to pbg after the offering 
the decline will be offset  in part  by continued investment in other international bottling operations and in frito lay international and full year capital spending in tropicana 
our strong cash generating capability and financial condition give us ready access to capital markets throughout the world
