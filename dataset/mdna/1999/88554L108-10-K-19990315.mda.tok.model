item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations annual table percentages of net sales the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research and development operating income loss other income income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were million for  an increase of percent compared with net sales of million for the sales increase was as a result of several new programs in for a variety of customers  including a major communications customer 
in  the company s largest customer accounted for net sales of million compared with net sales of million to that customer in  for an overall increase of percent 
the company s major customer accounted for approximately percent of net sales for compared with approximately percent for no other customer accounted for greater than percent of sales in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased to percent for as compared with percent for the corresponding decrease in the gross margin was the result of a number of factors  including manufacturing variances occurring as a result of the start up of the new manufacturing facility in beijing  some unfavorable yields occurring on the start up of several new programs  and increased pricing pressure from customers and competitors  partially as a result of the asian economic crisis 
selling  general  and administrative expense was million for  as compared with million in selling  general  and administrative expense increased in absolute terms as a result of increased selling expenses and the addition of administrative personnel 
as a result of increased revenue in  however  selling  general  and administrative expense declined to percent of net sales from percent of net sales in research and development expense totaled million  or percent of net sales for  as compared with million  or percent of net sales  for research and development expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists and other personnel  related facilities costs  including certain expenses associated with the development of new processes on the lcd line in tempe  arizona  and various expenses for projects 
research and development expense has increased as the company has invested in new technologies and manufacturing processes  developed new potential products  continued its in house process development efforts related to the high volume manufacturing lcd line  and developed application specific integrated circuits asics for its new display technologies 
the company believes that continued investments in research and development relating to manufacturing processes and new display technology are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace  as well as to provide opportunities for growth 
interest income net for was  down from  for the decrease in interest income was the result of investing lower average cash balances during the year as well as increased interest expense as a result of increased debt 
other expenses net decreased to  for from  for the decrease was primarily attributed to reduced foreign exchange losses 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million for  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million for the overall tax rate for the company for was percent as compared with percent for the increased tax rate is primarily as a result of the company having incurred losses in china  which is a low tax rate jurisdiction 
in such instance  the company does not obtain a tax benefit for the losses equal to its tax rate elsewhere in the world 
the company expects that the tax rate for will approximate percent 
for  the company reported net income of million  or per share diluted  as compared with net income of million  or per share diluted  for year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales were million for  an increase of percent compared with net sales of million for the sales increase was as a result of several new programs in for a variety of customers  including a major office automation customer 
in  the company s largest customer accounted for net sales of million compared with net sales of million to that customer in  for an overall decrease of percent 
the company s major customer accounted for approximately percent of net sales for compared with approximately percent for one other customer accounted for million  or percent of the net sales  in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to percent for as compared with percent for the corresponding increase in the gross margin was the result of a number of factors  including decreased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  decreased unfavorable manufacturing variances occurring as a result of increased manufacturing volume  labor utilization  and material purchases  and a more mature product mix with higher margins and better yields 
in the third quarter of  the company took a special one time provision for excess and obsolete inventory related primarily to end of life programs for which the majority of shipments  expected to occur in the latter part of  never materialized 
furthermore  the company was required to make significant design modifications to a new product  which also resulted in obsolete inventory 
without the provision for excess and obsolete inventory taken in the third quarter of  the cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  would have been percent for selling  general  and administrative expense was million for  as compared with million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute terms as a result of increased selling expenses and the addition of administrative personnel 
as a result of increased revenue in  however  selling  general  and administrative expense declined to percent of net sales from percent of net sales in research and development expense totaled million  or percent of net sales  for as compared with million  or percent of net sales  for research and development expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists and other personnel  related facilities costs  including certain expenses associated with the development of new processes on the lcd line in tempe  arizona  and various expenses for projects 
research and development expense increased in as the company invested in new technologies and manufacturing processes  developed new potential products  and continued its in house process development efforts related to the high volume manufacturing lcd line 
interest income net for was  up from  for the increase in interest income was the result of investing higher average cash balances during the year 
other expenses net increased to  for from  for the increase was primarily attributed to foreign exchange losses 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million for  as compared with a benefit from income taxes of million for this resulted primarily from having a loss in as compared with reporting net income in the overall tax rate for the company for was percent as compared with percent for for  the company reported net income of million  or per share diluted  as compared with a net loss of million  or per share diluted  for without the provision for excess and obsolete inventory taken in  the company would have reported net income of  or per share  in quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated financial results for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  the company believes that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter 
quarters ended in thousands  except per share amounts mar jun sep dec mar jun sep dec net sales         cost and expenses cost of sales         selling  general  and administrative         research and development 
        operating income loss        other income expense interest  net other  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes        provision for benefit from income taxes   net income loss     earnings loss per common share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares basic         diluted         liquidity and capital resources during  the company had net cash outflow from operations of  as compared with positive cash inflow of million during the decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable  the increase in inventory  and the decreased provision for inventory valuation reserves 
the increase in accounts receivable occurred primarily as a result of the increased sales activity in and the increase in inventory occurred primarily as a result of a build up for anticipated sales in the first quarter of depreciation expense in was million versus million in this increase was primarily as a result of an increased number of starts on the lcd manufacturing line in tempe  arizona 
the high volume lcd line is depreciated on a units of production method based on units started 
the company anticipates that depreciation will continue to rise in as a result of additional capital expenditures in  including the new building and equipment for the manufacturing facility in china  the installation of additional equipment in its manila manufacturing location  and the installation of additional equipment in tempe  arizona to manufacture lcos tm microdisplays 
the company s working capital was million at december   down from million at december  the company s current ratio at december  was to as compared with a current ratio of to at december  including its cash and loan commitments  the company had nearly million in readily available funds on december  in november  the company entered into a new million secured revolving line of credit with imperial bank and the national bank of canada 
the new credit facility matures in may and consists of a million revolving line of credit  which will be available for general corporate purposes the general facility  and a million long term loan  which will provide available funds to repurchase the company s stock the repurchase facility 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the repurchase facility 
advances under the loans may be made as prime rate advances  which accrue interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate  or as libor rate advances  which bear interest at basis points in excess of the libor base rate for the general facility and basis points in excess of the libor base rate for the repurchase facility 
the company s subsidiary  three five systems limited  has established an annually renewable credit facility with a united kingdom bank  barclays bank plc  in order to fund its working capital requirements 
the facility provides  of borrowing capacity secured by accounts receivable of three five systems limited 
advances are based on accounts receivable  as defined 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest  which is payable quarterly  at the bank s base rate plus basis points 
the united kingdom credit facility matures in july three five systems limited had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at december  in august  the board of directors authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to one million shares of the company s common stock on the open market or in negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions and other factors 
in october  the board of directors further extended and revised the repurchase program to authorize repurchases of up to million of common stock 
during the quarter ended december   the company purchased approximately  shares under the repurchase program at a total cost of million 
taking into account previous purchases  as of december   the company had purchased a total of approximately  shares under the repurchase program at a cost of million 
capital expenditures during were approximately million  as compared with million during capital expenditures for consisted primarily of manufacturing and office equipment for the company s operations in manila  arizona  and china and laboratory equipment for research and development 
the company anticipates that it will increase its capital expenditures during those expenditures will primarily relate to advanced manufacturing processes  the high volume lcd line  and necessary manufacturing equipment 
in  the company spent million for equipment and construction related to its beijing  china operations 
the company anticipates the facilities and capital cost for china in to be approximately million 
the company anticipates that accounts receivable and inventory will rise in if revenue levels increase as currently anticipated 
the company believes that its existing capital and anticipated cash flow from operations and credit lines will provide adequate sources to fund operations and planned expenditures throughout should the company encounter additional cash requirements  however  the company may have to expand its loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raising capital 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that adequate additional financing will be available or  if available  that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
effects of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations of the company for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the company generally sells its products and services and negotiates purchase orders with its foreign suppliers in united states dollars 
an exception is the sub assembly agreement in the philippines  which is based on a fixed conversion rate  exposing the company to exchange rate fluctuations with the philippine peso 
the company has not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date and there has been some minor benefit as a result of the peso devaluation  although the company is now required to pay approximately one third of any peso devaluation gain to its lessor and direct labor subcontractor in manila 
the company commenced operations in china in although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there is general speculation that china may devalue its currency in response to the current asian economic situation 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to the company s balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on monetary balances and loans of the company at the time of devaluation 
recently  the government in china has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although the company from time to time may enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize its exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge 
in addition  the government of china has recently imposed restrictions on chinese currency loans to foreign operated entities in china 
based on the foregoing  there can be no assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse affect on the company s operations 
business outlook and risk factors this business outlook section has numerous forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors associated with those forward looking statements are set forth in risk factors below 
other important risk factors are set forth under special considerations in item of this report 
the company offers advanced design and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers 
the company specializes in custom displays and front panel displays utilizing liquid crystal display lcd and light emitting diode led components and technology 
the company experienced substantial growth from through with such growth dependent primarily upon the company s participation in the substantial growth of the wireless communications market and sales to a single major customer in that industry 
in  the company s sales declined  largely as a result of the phase out by that major customer of a significant family of programs in early in  sales returned to pre levels primarily as a result of several new programs and customers  including a major office automation customer 
in  sales to that office automation customer were greatly reduced  but that reduction was more than offset by increased sales to the company s largest telecommunications customer 
sales in increased by about percent over  but net profit declined as the company increased r d expenses significantly  incurred start up expenses for china  and experienced pricing pressures from its asian competitors  partially as a result of the asian economic situation 
in  the company recorded almost percent of its revenue in the third and fourth quarters 
fourth quarter revenue in was almost percent greater than first quarter revenues in in  the company anticipates that this type of revenue pattern will be repeated 
the company believes that it has a pattern of seasonality to its sales as oems with retail products develop shorter product life cycles and phase out old programs early in the year following holiday sales 
the company has undertaken efforts to diversify its business  broaden its customer base  and expand its markets 
the company s historical major customer  which accounted for approximately percent of the company s revenue in  accounted for percent of the company s revenue in and slightly less than percent of the company s revenue in these reduced percentages occurred as a result of the increased sales to other customers and reduced product selling prices and revenues from that major customer 
in  however  the company s business with that customer has increased at a rate faster than business with other customers 
therefore  the percentage of revenue attributed to that customer substantially increased in in  the company expects its business with that customer to remain at approximately the same dollar amount 
in addition  the company plans to increase sales to other customers  which would result in declining customer concentration 
one other customer accounted for percent of the company s revenue in  but this percentage declined in to below percent of the company s revenue as older programs have matured 
some replacement programs did not have the type of lcd modules supplied by the company and those that did had significantly lower selling prices 
the company expects to do continued business with this customer  but does not expect it to constitute more than percent of its revenue in several factors impact the company s gross margins  including manufacturing efficiencies  product differentiation  product uniqueness  billings for non recurring engineering services  inventory management  engineering costs  product mix  and volume pricing 
there is significant pricing pressure in higher volume programs in the telecommunications and office automation industries 
as the production levels of some of the company s new high volume programs increase  the lower standard gross margins on those programs have had an impact on the company s overall margins 
in addition  in an effort to secure sales to certain strategic customers  the company may aggressively price its products 
depending on the size of the programs achieved  such pricing strategies also could have an effect on overall margins 
the company s gross margins on its products are also typically lower at the start of a program as a result of yield and other start up issues 
in the third quarter of  the company started several new programs and incurred substantial start up costs 
the company expects to start up several new programs throughout the company started operations in china in  and the company s gross margins have been adversely affected by the start up of those china manufacturing operations 
as the company ramped up its manufacturing operations in china  it incurred costs in advance of the receipt of significant revenues 
generally  the incremental china based expenses were in the total cost of sales 
those incremental expenses arose mainly from under absorption of the costs of operating the china facility and are included in the cost of sales  thus reducing overall gross margins 
in the fourth quarter of  the company had a slight profit in china because significant increases in manufacturing volumes resulted in absorption of the existing costs 
in the next few quarters  profitability in china will be volume dependent 
in the long run  however  the company expects the china operations to positively impact gross margins because of certain competitive cost advantages provided by maintaining operations in china 
the company anticipates that weakened asian currencies will have a continued impact on the company s gross margins 
many of the company s competitors are asian suppliers  and a strong us dollar gives a competitive pricing advantage to those suppliers 
thus  the company may continue to see competitive margin pressure from asian suppliers  particularly those in korea and japan 
serving a variety of customers with complex and differing issues requires increased personnel committed to those customers 
as the company expands and diversifies its product and customer base  the company has had to increase its selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the volume and complexity of the company s business is expected to continue to grow 
as a result  the company anticipates that it will continue to increase its selling and administrative expenses on a quarter by quarter basis 
the company believes that continued investments in research and development relating to new display technology and manufacturing processes are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace and to provide opportunities for growth 
the company continues to expand and intensify its internal research and development to focus on proprietary display products as well as continue lcd manufacturing process improvements 
use of the lcd manufacturing line in tempe  arizona as a resource for testing new ideas is key to development of these products  some of which will be proprietary and not available from other display manufacturers 
further  the development of the high volume manufacturing lcd line has helped reduce the company s dependence on foreign suppliers of lcd glass 
some of the company s new display technologies also require the development of application specific integrated circuits asics to electronically drive the displays 
development of custom asics is a lengthy and expensive process 
the company also intends to pursue technologies being developed in related fields 
the company operates the highest volume fully automated lcd manufacturing line in north america 
as a result  several companies have approached the company about potential alliances 
the company believes that a strategic alliance with one or more of those companies could minimize the cost of entry into new markets and new technologies 
for example  in national semiconductor corporation and the company entered into a strategic supplier alliance agreement for the development and manufacture of lcos tm microdisplays 
in april  the company acquired approximately a percent interest in siliscape  inc  a start up company with numerous patents and proprietary technology relating to microdisplays 
the company and siliscape  inc also entered into a strategic agreement under which they will focus on the development of microdisplay products  with the company providing certain proprietary manufacturing capabilities and siliscape  inc providing certain patented and proprietary technologies and components 
the company also is considering licensing from other companies technologies that could be optimized on the lcd manufacturing line  as well as entering into further alliances 
the company intends to continue this internal and external focus on research and development indefinitely 
as a result  the actual dollar amount of such research and development expenditures in will substantially increase over as previously described  the company has established manufacturing operations in china 
three five systems beijing co  ltd 
was incorporated in china during the first quarter of and business license approval was received from the governmental authorities 
during the first quarter of  a temporary leased site was selected in beijing  as was the permanent site 
in the second quarter of  the company moved into the temporary site and set up manufacturing lines 
in the third quarter of  the factory was qualified by customers and began making initial shipments 
in the fourth quarter of  the company shipped over million in products 
the company has established a china based manufacturing operation for several reasons 
first  based upon growth expectations in the european and united states marketplaces  the company anticipated a need for manufacturing capacity beyond what is available at its philippine manufacturing facility 
china was selected because of the desire to diversify manufacturing locations and because of the cost benefits that are expected to be achieved in china 
china also is expected to be a synergistic business location for the company because many of the components used by the company are manufactured in china 
second  many of the company s existing and potential customers maintain manufacturing operations near the company s operations in china 
despite the current asian economic situation  those customers continue to require lcd modules and the company has limited participation in that market 
there currently are very few lcd module manufacturers in china 
under current chinese government rules  however  oems in china have a strong motivation to utilize locally manufactured components 
risk factors forward looking statements in this report include revenue  margin  expense  and earnings analysis for as well as the company s expectations relating to operations in china  future technologies  and future designs  inventory balances  and production orders 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends  developments  and factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve its goals 
in addition  there are trends  developments  and factors beyond the company s control that may affect its operations 
the cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report  and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission  identify important trends  factors  and currently known developments that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements contained in this report and in any written or oral statements of the company 
a few core customers currently are responsible for a majority of the company s revenue  and the company expects the high concentration levels with its core customers to continue through thus  any material delay  cancellation  or reduction of orders from one or more of those core customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
although the trend of the company is to enter into more manufacturing contracts with its customers  the principal benefit of these contracts is to clarify order lead times  inventory risk allocation  and similar matters and not to provide firm  long term volume purchase commitments 
customers generally do not provide firm long term volume purchase commitments to the company 
thus  customers can cancel purchase commitments and change or delay expected volume levels 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to replace canceled  delayed  or reduced commitments in a timely manner 
if customers cancel  delay  or reduce commitments  the company could be left holding excess and obsolete inventory or having unfavorable manufacturing variances as a result of under absorption 
these risks are exacerbated because the company expects that a majority of its sales will be to customers in the retail electronics industry  which is subject to severe competitive pressures  rapid technological change  and obsolescence 
a few of the company s customers have inquired about inventory hubbing agreements  pursuant to which the company will maintain stocks of finished goods at or near the customer s factory 
although the company has not yet entered into such agreements with any of its customers  the use of such type of agreements could result in higher inventory balances for the company and or excess inventory 
another risk inherent in custom manufacturing is the satisfactory completion of design services and securing of production orders 
the company anticipates that a significant portion of its revenue for the future will come from programs currently in the design or pilot production stage 
completion of the design depends on a variety of factors  including the customer s changing needs  and not every design is successful in meeting those needs 
in addition  some designs test new theories or applications and may not meet the desired results 
failure of a design order to achieve the customer s desired results could result in a material adverse effect on the company s operations if the expected production order for that product was significant 
finally  even when a design is satisfactorily completed  the customer may terminate or delay the program as a result of marketing or other pressures 
the company currently is investing in research and development of several new technologies that it plans to introduce in the future 
the company faces the risk that some or all of those technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development lab to cost effective manufacturability as a result of technology problems  competitive cost issues  yield problems  and other factors 
in addition  even if a new technology proves to be manufacturable  the company s customers and the customers marketplaces may not accept it because of price or technology issues or because it compares unfavorably with products introduced by others 
the company will be required to make significant expenditures  including development expenses and various capital expenditures and investments  for these new technologies 
for example  the company estimates that its initial capital expenditures for lcos tm microdisplays will be approximately million to million 
the company also made an equity investment of million in siliscape during for the purposes of further developing the lcos tm microdisplay product 
significant investments in one or more of the new technologies  especially lcos tm microdisplays  that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful for any reason could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  if siliscape were to encounter technological or financial difficulties  the value of the company s investment could decline  in which case the company would have to write down all or a portion of its investment and report a loss equal to such write down 
the company designs and manufactures products based on firm quotes 
thus  the company bears the risk of component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
in addition  the company depends on certain suppliers  and the unavailability or shortage of materials could cause delays or lost orders 
material components of some of the company s major programs from time to time have been subject to allocation because of shortages by vendors and continued or increased shortages could have a material adverse effect on the company in the future 
in addition  the company purchases many product components from vendors in asian countries 
economic instability in certain asian countries could cause supply problems with respect to these components 
the company s primary competitors are located in asia  including  japan  korea  and hong kong  and most of the company s customers are us based 
the recent currency devaluation of several asian countries has had  and could continue to have  a negative impact on the gross margins of the company as the competitors products become less expensive to purchase with a stronger dollar 
the company has established a manufacturing operation in china 
the company s operations and assets will be subject to significant political  economic  legal and other uncertainties in china 
the company s operations in china also could be adversely affected by the imposition of austerity measures intended to reduce inflation  the inadequate development or maintenance of infrastructure  including the unavailability of adequate power and water supplies  transportation  raw materials  and parts  or a deterioration of the general political  economic or social environment in china 
the company has set up manufacturing operations in beijing in an interim leased facility 
if there are delays in the completion of the permanent facility  the company may run into capacity issues in the interim facility because of space constraints and or power requirements 
in addition  the company has a short term lease on the interim facility and could be required to move out if there are delays in the completion of the permanent facility  which would severely interrupt the company s manufacturing operations in china 
one of the reasons the company is starting up operations in china is because the company believes that its manila manufacturing facility may have occasional capacity issues within the next year 
failure to begin operations in the permanent china facility on a timely basis could result in capacity restraints and late or canceled customer deliveries 
manufacturing yields and delivery schedules also may be affected as the company ramps up its manufacturing capabilities in china 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in expanding or relocating manufacturing output and capacity  with such difficulty resulting in reduced yields or delays in product deliveries 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will not experience manufacturing yield or delivery problems in the future 
such problems could materially affect the company s operating results 
finally  the company s success  especially in penetrating new markets and increasing its oem customer base  depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of services of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business also depends upon its ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled employees 
failure to do so could adversely affect the company s operations 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  the company s stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by investors  analysts  and brokers could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  other factors  which generally affect the market for stocks of high technology companies  could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods for reasons unrelated to the company s performance 
year compliance disclosure many existing computer programs and databases use only two digits to identify a year in the date field ie  would represent 
these programs and databases were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming millennium 
consequently  date sensitive computer programs may interpret the date as rather than if not corrected  many computer systems could fail or create erroneous results in the following disclosure is as required by sec release no 
company s state of readiness the company has completed an assessment of all of its internal and external systems and processes with respect to the year issue 
in response to this assessment  the company has created a multi functional year task force to resolve any non compliant year systems or processes 
to date  this group is on schedule to complete this task during the company plans to continuously test all of its internal and external systems and processes  including the associated year fixes  for year compliance during as part of this process  the company has assessed the potential impact of year failures from vendors and outside parties upon its business and currently is taking steps to minimize that risk 
based on the company s current state of readiness and the steps currently being taken ie  installing backup processes and systems  the company does not believe that the year problem will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  liquidity  or operations 
company s costs of year compliance the company estimates that its total cost of year compliance will be less than  those costs include updating of computer software and hardware manufacturing equipment  as well as employment and other out of pocket costs 
company s risks of year issues the company procures a significant amount of raw materials used in its manufacturing processes from foreign vendors 
as a result  the company may be at risk from foreign companies and countries that are not taking adequate measures to ensure year compliance or that may not be at the same level of preparedness as the united states 
for example  economic problems in asia may affect or divert resources with respect to the year issue 
failure of those foreign countries and companies to be year compliant may cause new material shortages that would adversely impact the company s manufacturing operations 
in addition  the company currently has significant manufacturing operations in manila  the philippines and beijing  china 
as a result  the company may be at risk with respect to suppliers of necessary resources such as power or water that may not be year compliant 
for example  brownouts or blackouts may occur due to lack of year compliance 
in addition  the company s customers may have catastrophic year failures  including prolonged interruptions in factory productions  in which case they may have a reduced demand for the company s products 
company s contingency plans the company is developing contingency plans with respect to significant year issues within its control 
for example  the company is in the process of assessing and verifying the year compliance of its international and domestic raw material vendors 
verification will be accomplished through the use of written certifications and audits 
the company intends to replace any vendors found not to be year compliant with vendors that are year compliant 
in the construction of its new beijing facility  the company will procure material  processes  and equipment that are year compliant 
the company also is investigating the use of stand by generators for its plants in the event of a local power failure 
the company is investigating transferring all manufacturing processes to alternate manufacturing facilities if external factors beyond its control relative to the year issue occur and the company cannot conduct manufacturing operations at any particular facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
at december  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
the company holds no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company incurs interest on loans made under a revolving line of credit at interest rates under a variable interest rate of the bank s prime rate at december  plus  the principal of which is due at december   the company s outstanding borrowings on the line of credit was approximately million 
substantially all of the company s business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions 
the company operates high volume manufacturing facilities in manilla  the philippines and beijing  china  and a sales and distribution facility in the united kingdom 
some of the expenses of these foreign operations are denominated in the philippine peso  chinese renminbi  and british pound sterling  respectively 
these expenses include local salaries and wages  utilities and some operating supplies 
however  the company believes that the operating expenses currently incurred in foreign currencies are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition
