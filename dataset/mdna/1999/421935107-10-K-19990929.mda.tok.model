year state of year readiness the company began work on its year project in and established a year project office and year project team in early the company s year project office is comprised of the company s senior information services is management team  which provides business support and resources for the overall project 
the company s year project team  under the leadership of the cio  consists of the company s is employees  independent consultants  and business representatives on an as needed basis 
there are five phases to the company s year project phase identify and analyze  phase plan and schedule  phase execute the plan remediate  upgrade  replace  or eliminate  phase test and integrate  and phase maintain year integrity 
the goal of the company s year project is to prepare the company s computer systems  applications  facilities including non information technology systems  such as security systems and external relationships for the year the primary focus of the year project effort has been  and continues to be  on the company s mission critical systems  which are those that support and interface with our clients or vendors 
the company s year project is comprised of many different platforms and components and the company is at varying project phases with respect to the different components 
in phase i of the year project  the company completed a general inventory of its work environment 
the inventory included system hardware  system software  utilities phone  electric  etc  as well as additional facility components 
the project team has completed its inventory of mission critical components 
during phase of the company s year project  the year project team provided initial size estimates for the scope of each mission critical system component that was identified  and developed a strategy including a timetable  for achieving compliance for each of these components 
in addition  the year project team developed a communication plan for internal and external communications regarding the year as of june   the company had completed the majority of the remediation of its mission critical applications phase 
the company s qualityfirst r product is year ready in that it processes four digit year dates  in accordance with the software release note delivered to customers

we expect that the majority of the remaining year project activities  including the majority of contingency planning  will be completed by november nevertheless  because of the unique nature of the year issue  there will be some contingency planning and ongoing maintenance activities that will continue into the year year project costs costs of the company s year project through june  were approximately million 
an additional 
million is expected to be incurred during fiscal year the costs associated with the year project has been and will be expensed as incurred 
year risks the company is reliant on technology and outside vendors to deliver its services 
while the company may have more than one vendor to provide a specific service to the company  for those services for which the company does not have more than one vendor  the company does not intend to hire backup vendors 
there could be a material adverse effect on the company if there is a failure by the company  or a third party dealing with the company  to be year ready with respect to such things as a mission critical computer system or software application  facilities and equipment  or the ability to provide necessary services or products 
possible consequences of such a failure include temporary disruption of the company s ability to deliver services to its clients 
the scope and length of time of such a disruption will depend upon the particular circumstances  some of which may be beyond the company s control 
the company s year project plans are subject to change and are necessarily dependent upon management s business decisions and other factors  both internal and external  and the company is making adjustments to its year project as it deems necessary 
the information contained in this statement is based on management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that third parties on which the company relies  or that the company itself  will be year ready 
the results of the year project could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of factors such as the impact of the company s external relationships including the year readiness of the company s business partners  its key vendors  its customers  and its customers key vendors  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  and the ability to identify relevant computer codes 
year contingency plans in june  the company began to focus on contingency planning efforts 
the company will be using contingency plans already in place relating to back up of information systems  as well as some business operations 
the company is developing additional and or supplemental contingency plans where necessary 
contingency plans have been developed for most of the company s significant business processes  and the company will complete contingency plans for the remaining significant business processes by november ongoing contingency planning activities will continue into the year forward looking statements forward looking statements in this report reflected as expectations  plans  anticipations  prospects or future estimates are subject to the risks and the uncertainties present in the company s business and the competitive healthcare marketplace including  but not limited to clients and vendors commonly experiencing mergers or acquisitions  use of estimates for incurred but not yet reported claims including medical services payable  use of estimates of bonus accruals including accounts receivable  reconciliations  volume fluctuations  provider relations and contracting  participant enrollment fluctuations  changes in member mix or utilization levels  fixed price contracts  contract disputes  contract modifications  contract renewals and non renewals  regulatory issues and requirements  various business reasons for delaying contract closings  and the operational challenges of matching case volume with optimum staffing  having fully trained staff  having computer and telephonic supported operations and managing turnover of key employees and outsourced services to performance standards 
while occurrences of these risks  and others periodically detailed in the company s sec reports  cannot be predicted exactly  such occurrences can be expected to have an impact on the hrm s anticipated level of revenue growth or profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions 
the company s note payable and term loan obligations are subject to interest rate risk 
a basis point increase in interest rates related to the note payable to bank under revolving credit agreement  assuming the amount borrowed remains constant  would result in an annual increase in the company s then current interest expense of approximately  a basis point increase in interest rates related to the company s term loans payable would not result in a material change in its fair value
