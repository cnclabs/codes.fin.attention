revenues for were down to million compared to revenues of million 
the decrease in revenues and net income was due to the steep decline in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls prices  higher operating expenses  increased administrative and general costs  higher interest expense  and preferred stock dividends 
anadarko s performance was also adversely affected by a non cash charge during the fourth quarter of million before taxes million after taxes to impair all exploration activity in peru and jordan  as well as two dry holes drilled on the zula block in eritrea 
excluding the impairment  anadarko s net loss for was million  or cents per share diluted 
anadarko s net income was million cents per share  which included a gain of million million after income taxes on the sale of the company s indonesia interests and was partially offset by provisions for impairments of other international properties of million million after income taxes 
revenues for were million 
the increases in revenues and net income in compared to reflect higher production volumes of crude oil  natural gas and ngls coupled with higher natural gas prices 
costs and expenses millions operating expenses administrative and general dd a other taxes gains and impairments related to international properties  net total costs and expenses during  anadarko s costs and expenses excluding the impairment increased over primarily due to increased levels of activity 
anadarko pays close attention to costs  focusing on cost controls  cost savings plans and the application of new technology to field production operations 
during  costs and expenses were up largely due to these reasons operating expenses increased million due to costs associated with the commencement of production in algeria and the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties in the us administrative and general expenses were up million  reflecting increased costs associated with first production from algeria  expenses related to reducing future administrative and general costs  and other expenses associated with the company s growing workforce 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense rose million due primarily to the production volume increase 
costs and expenses for increased over  including the effect of the sale of the company s indonesia interests 
in addition  costs and expenses were impacted by the following factors operating expenses increased million due primarily to higher levels of drilling activity and revised ngls contracts that provide for processing through third parties 
administrative and general expenses were up million due to higher costs associated with the company s growing workforce 
dd a expense was up million due primarily to the increase in us production volumes from core areas of operation compared to interest expense millions gross interest expense capitalized interest net interest expense interest expense anadarko s gross interest expense has increased over the past three years due primarily to higher levels of borrowings for capital expenditures  including producing property acquisitions

anadarko s average crude oil price for decreased compared to crude oil prices weakened significantly in due to several factors  including continued lack of cold weather  higher storage inventories and perceptions of the impact of increased quotas from the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec 
crude oil prices in were down compared to generally  the company s oil production is sold on a monthly basis as it is produced 
production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices 
the company s ngls sales volumes in increased compared to primarily due to the restructuring of processing agreements in late ngls production volumes in increased compared to volumes 
the average ngls price was down compared to by comparison  ngls prices were below marketing strategies natural gas the us natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last years and management believes continued growth to be likely 
natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so 
management believes the company s excellent portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position anadarko to continue to participate in this growth 
anadarko s wholly owned marketing subsidiary anadarko energy services company aes is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing and services tailored to its customers needs 
most of the company s gas production is sold through aes 
aes also purchases and sells third party gas in the company s market areas 
aes sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
aes has expanded its marketing capabilities to move larger volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various hedging strategies to better manage price risk associated with natural gas sales 
see use of derivatives 
crude oil and condensate anadarko s revenues are derived from production in the us and algeria 
presently  most of the company s us crude oil production is sold on day evergreen contracts with prices based on postings plus a premium 
initial production from the hbns field in algeria began in may oil from the hbns field is lifted by tanker load and sold as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a very high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
in  the company lifted two cargoes from algeria 
aes purchases and sells third party crude oil and condensate in the company s market areas 
gas gathering systems and processing plants anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of reserves and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
anadarko owns and operates five major gas gathering systems in the company s core producing areas 
the company s overall gas gathering capacity is more than mmcf d and serves about  wells 
approximately of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
during  the company shut down its last fully owned and operated gas processing facility 
the company also sold its interests in three other plants during the company has elected to have its gas processed by third parties  increasing the company s net ngls production volumes 
the increased revenues were partially offset by higher operating expenses 
use of derivatives anadarko produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  and ngls 
as a result  anadarko s financial results can be significantly affected by changes in these commodity prices 
anadarko uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the company s exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas and crude oil  to provide methods to fix the price for natural gas independently of the physical purchase or sale and to manage interest rates 
commodity financial instruments also provide methods to meet customer pricing requirements while achieving a price structure consistent with the company s overall pricing strategy 
while commodity financial instruments are intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in the market price of natural gas and crude oil  the commodity financial instruments may also limit anadarko s gain from increases in the market price of natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  gains and losses on commodity financial instruments are generally offset by similar changes in the realized price of natural gas and crude oil 
gains and losses are recognized in revenues for the periods to which the commodity financial instruments relate 
anadarko s commodity financial instruments currently are comprised of futures  swaps and options contracts 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
while the volume of derivative commodity instruments utilized by the company to hedge its market price risk can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established policy guidelines  the fair value of those instruments at december  and was  in the judgment of the company  immaterial 
additionally  through the use of sensitivity analysis the company evaluates the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in the market prices of natural gas and crude oil may have on the fair value of the company s derivative commodity instruments 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a adverse movement in commodity prices  the potential decrease in the fair value of the derivative commodity instruments at december  and does not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company also evaluated the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreement 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual interest rate in effect as of december  and and assuming a increase in interest rates  the potential decrease in the fair value of the derivative interest swap instrument at december  and does not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company

reserve replacement drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company 
anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves 
the company believes its performance in both areas is excellent 
for the th consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on an energy equivalent barrel eeb basis 
during  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement was of total production  which was a record mmeebs 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production  which was mmeebs 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production 
over the last five years  the company s annual reserve replacement has averaged of annual production volumes 
anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the us while the nation s energy reserves have been declining over the past ten years 
in  the company replaced of its us production volumes with us reserves 
this compares to a us reserve replacement of of production volumes in the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was of production 
by comparison  the most recent published us industry average was 
source department of energy anadarko s us reserve replacement performance for the same period was of production 
industry data for are not yet available 
cost of finding cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
anadarko has consistently outperformed the industry in average finding costs 
for the period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per eeb 
the company s us finding performance for the same period was per eeb 
industry data for are not yet available 
for comparison purposes  the most recent published five year average for the industry shows worldwide finding cost was per eeb and us finding cost was per eeb 
source arthur andersen and js herold for the same five year period of  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per eeb and its us finding cost was per eeb 
the company s low finding costs are due to the success of anadarko s exploration programs 
for  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per eeb compared to per eeb in and per eeb in anadarko s us finding cost for was per eeb compared to per eeb in and per eeb in proved reserves at the end of  anadarko s proved reserves were mmeebs compared to mmeebs at year end and mmeebs at year end reserves increased by in compared to primarily due to exploration and development drilling in both the us and overseas and producing property acquisitions 
anadarko s proved reserves have grown by over the past three years  primarily as a result of successful exploration projects in algeria  the gulf of mexico and alaska  as well as successful exploitation and development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and producing property acquisitions 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were trillion cubic feet tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved us gas reserves have increased since year end  reflecting two major discoveries in the gulf of mexico s sub salt trend and continued development activity onshore us anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end increased to million barrels mmbbls compared to mmbbls at year end and mmbbls at year end crude oil reserves have risen by over the last three years primarily due to large discoveries in algeria  the gulf of mexico and alaska 
crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves comprise of the company s proved reserves at year end compared to about at year end and at year end the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geologic and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional performance data 
at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and was billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission and financial accounting standards board 
the estimated present value of future net revenues  after income taxes  increased compared to primarily due to additions of proved reserves related to successful exploration and development drilling worldwide  partially offset by significantly lower natural gas and crude oil prices at year end see supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities in the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves  and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
acquisitions and divestitures the company s strategy also includes an active asset acquisition and divestiture program 
during  anadarko acquired through purchases and trades mmeebs of proved reserves for million 
during the same time period  the company sold properties  either as a strategic exit or by asset rationalization in existing core areas  with proceeds totaling million 
reserves associated with these sales and trades were mmeebs 
in  anadarko acquired reserves of mmeebs in several transactions totaling million 
the largest acquisition was a package of working interests in five oil and gas fields in the anadarko basin of central oklahoma  a core operating area of the company for years  which was purchased from oxy usa  inc for million 
the five oil and gas fields cover  gross acres with producing and injection wells 
anadarko s net production from these fields was about mbbls d and mmcf d of gas 
the acquisition also included an interest in a mile  eight inch diameter pipeline that delivers co to the fields and primarily serves third parties 
in  acquisitions of producing properties totaled million and mmeebs 
the largest acquisition was a package of properties in the west panhandle field of texas for million  which accounted for mmeebs of proved reserves 
this purchase provided the company producing properties with significant development potential as well as settling a disputed claim on revenues 
during  anadarko sold reserves of about mmeebs in several transactions with sales proceeds totaling million 
the largest component was the sale of the company s norden ltd 
partnership in colorado in late for million 
during  anadarko sold reserves of mmeebs  of which mmeebs were attributed to the company s interests in indonesia 
total proceeds from divestitures in amounted to million 
in  acquisitions of producing properties totaled million and mmeebs 
the largest acquisition was a package of properties in the oklahoma panhandle portion of the hugoton embayment 
recent developments under the full cost method of accounting  a non cash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low 
whether the company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter  as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter 
if a non cash charge were required  it would reduce earnings for the quarter  which would result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
prices for crude oil and natural gas were significantly lower at year end compared to year end since the end of  gas prices have continued to fall 
if the current pricing environment continues or worsens  the company may be required to take a non cash charge against earnings during the first quarter of producing properties and leases the company owns  net producing oil wells and  net producing gas wells worldwide 
the following schedule shows the number of developed and undeveloped acres in which anadarko held interests at december  acreage developed undeveloped total gross net gross net gross net thousands united states onshore     offshore total     algeria     eritrea     jordan     north atlantic margin   peru     tunisia developed acreage for algeria relates only to the area with an exploitation license  which is the hbns field 
regulatory matters environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection of most oil and gas projects from commencement to abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions to the atmosphere  discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of well and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service under the department of interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
additional factors affecting business the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from algerian properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  including commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not fully insured against all risks in its business  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is increasingly involved in large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by host country governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated timing and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
year overview the year issue relates to the inability of certain computers and software applications to correctly recognize and process date sensitive information for the year and beyond 
without correction  the computers and software applications could fail or create erroneous information 
the company has established a year compliance program focused on minimizing disruptions of the company s operations as a result of the millennium change 
since this problem could affect the company s systems  as well as the systems of its business partners  the program focuses on the internal systems and external services considered most critical to anadarko s continuing operations 
since  the company has enhanced its scientific processing capabilities  implemented new business systems and upgraded its network infrastructure 
these information systems were purchased from leading suppliers of technology  most of which are representing their products to be year compliant 
the company is in the process of testing third party hardware and software for compliance  which should be completed by mid year any necessary replacements of non compliant computer equipment and software are underway and should also be completed by mid year embedded system inventories for domestic and internal operations were completed on schedule by year end contract instrumentation specialists are assessing the inventories of equipment and will develop remediation and test plans by the end of first quarter all embedded systems are expected to be compliant by the end of the third quarter of the company is assessing the readiness of its business partners  including joint venture operators and outside operated pipeline and processing facilities as well as suppliers of goods and services 
interruptions in these services could disrupt anadarko s production and delivery of oil  gas and ngls early in analysis and review of key business partners is underway 
natural gas affiliates providing gathering  transportation and processing services are being contacted to determine year compliance at inter connect and sales points 
operations personnel have begun the development of critical vendor and commodities lists and are assessing the suppliers and availability of goods and services in these areas 
these efforts should be completed by the end of the third quarter of contingency planning the company will develop contingency plans to provide business continuity and to address operations  safety and environmental concerns 
this effort has begun and is expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of estimated cost the total cost of testing  remediation and contingency planning is expected to be approximately million  which will be funded by operating cash flows 
this estimate does not include the company s share of potential year costs as a result of participation in partnerships in which anadarko is not the operator 
as of december   the company had spent less than million for the year project 
these expenditures include costs to establish year testing facilities  inventory field automation equipment domestically and internationally  and purchase year scanning software 
in total  the company expects to spend million to test internal systems  upgrade and replace hardware and software  and complete field automation testing 
the remaining million is for replacement of any non compliant field automation equipment discovered during testing  instrumentation consulting services and contingency planning 
anadarko s year program is an on going process that may result in changes to cost estimates and schedules as testing and business partner assessment progresses 
risks the company expects to have all internal systems and computer equipment year compliant prior to the millennium change 
the company is relying on its business partners and suppliers to be year ready as well 
failure of significant third parties to complete their year compliance projects could interrupt the supply of materials and contract services needed for oil and gas operations 
disruptions to oil and gas transportation networks controlled by third party carriers could result in reduced production volumes delivered to market 
risk associated with foreign operations may increase with the uncertainty of year compliance by foreign governments and their supporting infrastructures 
such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
however  the year program is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year issue 
kansas ad valorem tax the natural gas policy act of allowed a severance  production or similar tax to be included as an add on  over and above the maximum lawful price for natural gas 
based on the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ruling that the kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax  the company collected the kansas ad valorem tax 
ferc s ruling regarding the ability of producers to collect the kansas ad valorem tax was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc circuit 
the court held in june that ferc failed to provide a reasoned basis for its findings and remanded the case to ferc 
ultimately  the dc circuit issued its decision on august  ruling that producers must refund all kansas ad valorem taxes collected relating to production since october the company filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the supreme court
