overview precept is an independent distributor of custom and stock business products and provider of document management services business products to businesses in a variety of industries throughout the united states 
we also operate corporate transportation services transportation services companies in the united states 
we were founded in as a subsidiary of acs and have grown since then  both internally and through acquisitions 
in june  we were spun off from acs in a tax free stock exchange to acs shareholders in connection with the initial public offering of acs 
we were one of the first distributor companies to begin nationwide consolidation of operating companies in the business products industry 
since  we have acquired companies in the business products industry plus in the transportation services industry 
a component of our business strategy is to increase the size of our operations through strategic acquisitions and internally generated growth 
we place substantial emphasis on improving operational and information system capabilities while integrating acquired operations 
our operational focus also includes continuous upgrading of management systems allowing improved customer access to financial inventory and order status information  new product and service offerings  preferred vendor programs incorporating volume purchasing  regional and district management oversight  and recruiting experienced sales individuals 
we believe that these strategies will lead to lower cost of goods and increased sales of various products and services to existing and new customers 
acquisitions our results of operations and the comparability of our results of operations from period to period have been significantly affected by businesses acquired in each period 
from through the date of this report  we completed acquisitions business products distribution companies and transportation services companies 
two business products companies acquired in fiscal year were accounted for using the pooling of interests method and  as a result  our consolidated financial statements have been restated to combine our financial statements with the pooled companies financial statements for all periods prior to the completion of the acquisitions 
the remaining acquisitions have been accounted for following the purchase method and  as a result  the results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in our results of operations from the dates of acquisition

these acquisitions were paid for with million in cash  financed by our revolving line of credit 
purchase accounting effects except as noted above  our acquisitions have been primarily accounted for using the purchase accounting method 
the acquisitions have currently affected  and will prospectively affect  our results of operations in certain significant respects 
our revenues and operating expenses will be directly affected by the timing of the acquisitions 
the aggregate acquisition costs  including assumption of debt  are allocated to the net assets acquired based on the fair market value of such net assets 
the allocations of the purchase price result in an increase in the historical book value of certain assets  including property and equipment  and will generally result in the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to goodwill  which results in incremental annual amortization expense 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items from continuing operations as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal years ended june   and year ended june  revenue business products transportation services operating expenses cost of goods sold sales commissions selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization goodwill write down and other non recurring charges non recurring acquisition costs operating income interest and other expense interest expense other expense  net income before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue for increased by million  or  from million in to million in in  business products revenue increased by million or and transportation services revenue increased by million or 
the increase in business products revenue was due to the acquisition of nine business products companies during fiscal years and  which accounted for million and internal growth of million or 
the internal growth excludes the effect of the lost revenue from mbf 
of the total increase in transportation services revenue in  million was due to the acquisition of transportation companies in and cost of goods sold for increased by million  or  from million in to million in cost of goods sold for business products increased by million of which approximately million was due to companies acquired after the beginning of fiscal year cost of goods sold from internal growth decreased by million due to the effect in of the company s improved purchasing power and the mix of products sold 
transportation services cost of goods sold increased by million due primarily to the transportation companies acquired since the beginning of as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold for decreased by from in to in this decrease was caused primarily by the acquisition of business products companies in less price competitive markets  by the mix of products sold  by improved purchasing power and by the higher relative effect of the transportation services division 
sales commissions increased by million  or  in  from million in to million in due primarily to the increased level of business products revenue 
sales commissions for the business products division increased from to of business products revenue primarily due to the effect of the commission plans of companies acquired since july  and to the increased dollar amount of gross profit in total commission expense decreased by from in to in because the transportation services division contributed a higher proportion of consolidated revenue in selling  general and administrative expense increased by million or in from million in to million in  which included increased expenses of million from business products and transportation services companies acquired 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased by from in to in this percentage increase in selling  general and administrative expense results primarily from the companies acquired in and and the management and organization infrastructure put in place to control and manage the business products division 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in from million in to million in due largely to the size and timing of the companies acquired since the beginning of goodwill write down and other non recurring charges 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded goodwill write down and other non recurring charges totaling million relating to matters and events which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year the significant components are described below 
goodwill we received formal notification from ford motor company that the contract for employee bus shuttle service would not be renewed after june  as a result  we evaluated the undiscounted cash flows that will be generated by the remaining operations at our dearborn  michigan location 
we determined that the cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the net book value of the intangible assets for the location 
as a result  we wrote off the amount  million  by which the net book value of the intangible assets exceeded the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the operations in dearborn 
we expect that the revenue  earnings  and cash flow generated by the ford contract will be replaced during fiscal year by contributions from other town car and limousine companies that have been acquired or which are expected to be acquired during the next fiscal year 
we expect that the level of revenue necessary to replace earnings from the ford contract will need to be higher than the revenue generated by the ford contract 
mbf on february   substantially all of the management  sales force and employees of mbf and mail source  inc resigned to join a competitor  peregrine  that had been founded and funded by the same individuals 
in response to this departure  we are in litigation with peregrine and the former officers of mbf for damages 
we continue to pursue this litigation for damages while also discussing potential financial settlements 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into financial settlement discussions that were not productive due to peregrine s unwillingness to agree to a financial settlement on terms we considered reasonable 
as a result of this departure  we have closed and are in the process of selling certain sales offices and warehouses  collecting outstanding accounts receivable  selling inventories and settling certain remaining trade  lease  tax and other obligations 
as part of this effort  we recorded million of asset write downs and other charges expected to be incurred in connection with winding down the operations of mbf 
these charges include expected losses on the sale of inventories and of land and buildings  expected losses on the collection of accounts receivable  remaining lease obligations  litigation costs  termination costs  and other liabilities 
during the third quarter ended march   the business products revenue from existing operations declined by million  principally due to the departure of substantially all of the sales force of mbf 
as we have wound down and closed the sales offices and warehouses of mbf  our revenue was negatively affected by approximately million during the fourth quarter of we expect that the negative impact from mbf will be at least as significant during the first three quarters of in addition  our annual revenues will be negatively affected by approximately million due to the departure of substantially all of the sales force 
while we expect that our internal revenue  cash flow  earnings  and cash flow growth rate will offset the loss of mbf s revenues and earnings  there can be no assurance that such revenue and earnings will be recovered 
other during the third quarter of  we recorded million of non recurring charges 
these included an investment of million in the preferred stock on an entertainment company which was written down to zero value to reflect management s estimate of the recoverability of its investment due to financial difficulties and financial restructuring of the entertainment company

we increased our health claim reserve by million based on health claim payment trends during the third quarter of other reserves and liabilities increased by million to address various matters and events that occurred during the third quarter of interest expense increased by million or during  from million in to million in principally due to additional debt incurred by us in and to finance our business acquisitions 
income tax benefit is provided at a effective benefit rate in compared to a tax provision rate in the change in the effective tax rate for is due primarily to the non deductibility of the goodwill write down and goodwill amortization expense as well as changes in the valuation allowance 
net income loss from continuing operations decreased by million in  from million in to million in  due to the reasons described above 
diluted earnings per share decreased from in to in excluding the goodwill write down and non recurring charges recorded during the third quarter of  diluted net income per share increased by per share to per share in diluted earnings per share for will not equal the sum of the quarterly earnings per share due to the difference in the weighted average number of shares caused primarily by the timing of acquisitions where class a common stock was used as part of the purchase consideration 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue for increased by million  or  from million in to million in in  business products revenue increased by million or and transportation services revenues increased million or 
the increase in business products revenue was due to the acquisition of three business products companies during  which accounted for million  and internal growth from existing and pooled companies of million

other expenses of million in are due primarily to a subsidiary s write off of an investment and one time payment by the shareholder of an acquired subsidiary 
income taxes are provided at a effective rate in compared to a rate in this reduction is due primarily to state income tax and non deductible expense reductions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flows from operating activities 
during fiscal year  we generated million in cash from operating activities 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities from to is due to the increased size of the company  improved results from operations and a reduction in working capital 
in fiscal year  the company used million in cash from operations as compared to million generated in during  increases in accounts receivable  inventory and other current assets were funded with borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
during fiscal year  the company increased its net income due to the benefits of companies acquired in the previous two years and the reduction of the losses from discontinued operations 
during fiscal year  the cash flow generated by business products and transportation services continuing operations was largely offset by the cash needs of the discontinued operations of two subsidiaries  precept builders  inc builders and precept holdings  inc holdings 
the company used its revolving line of credit to supplement any cash needs that were not provided by operating activities 
during  cash flow from operations was significantly reduced by the levels of accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for one of its discontinued operations 
the working capital of continuing operations was a relatively constant million to million during this period 
net cash flows from investing activities 
during fiscal year  we used million of cash for investing activities 
we used million of cash to acquire businesses during fiscal year we also acquired million of equipment and generated million from the sale of the net assets of our discontinued operations

during  the company acquired two businesses for million and paid million for contingent consideration 
in addition  the company spent million to acquire property and equipment  primarily for information systems equipment  warehouse equipment  town cars and office furniture and fixtures 
net cash flows from financing activities 
during fiscal year  we generated million of cash by financing activities 
we borrowed a net amount of million under the company s revolving line of credit and used such amount primarily to finance business acquisitions 
during fiscal  we repaid million of long term debt  we repaid million of capitalized lease obligations and we purchased million of treasury stock 
in fiscal year  million of cash was generated by financing activities as compared to million of cash generated by financing activities in fiscal year during  precept increased its outstanding revolving line of credit balance by approximately million in order to finance acquisitions 
in addition  the company financed million of its equipment purchases with capitalized lease obligations and collected million in notes receivable from shareholders for prior stock purchases 
during  the company increased its revolving line of credit by approximately million in order to finance its acquisitions of property and equipment and its acquisitions of businesses 
the company also borrowed million in long term debt to finance equipment purchases 
during fiscal year  one of the company s acquired subsidiaries distributed dividends of million to the subsidiary s former shareholder 
although the goodwill write down and other non recurring charges affected our operating results for  such items did not affect our cash flow from operations 
as certain of the obligations provided for in the non recurring charges are settled  we anticipate a use of approximately million in cash principally during fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we used of cash to settle certain of these non recurring charges 
management believes that the current levels of operations and the cash flow from such operations and the amount available for borrowing under the existing revolving line of credit agreement of million will be adequate for fiscal year to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures of approximately million for fiscal year  and to meet working capital needs 
on march   we signed a revolving line of credit agreement credit agreement with bank one  texas  na the credit agreement provides up to million for borrowing by us to be used for acquisitions  working capital  and general corporate purposes 
the amount available under the credit agreement is determined based on a multiple of three times the trailing twelve months pro forma ebitda 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
ebitda is also adjusted for the historical ebitda of acquired companies for the periods during the trailing twelve months that the acquired companies results of operations are not included in our historical operating results 
the operating results of acquired companies are also adjusted on a pro forma basis for interest  depreciation  amortization  owners compensation and non recurring charges 
two banks  bank one  texas  na and wells fargo bank  na  participated in this credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for an increase of million if new lenders join the banking group or existing lenders increase their levels of commitment 
the credit agreement includes other customary covenants and conditions relating to the conduct and operation of our business 
specifically  each quarter we will be subject to a ebitda to interest coverage ratio  to minimum net worth levels and to limits on capital expenditures 
in addition  acquisitions of companies with a purchase price greater than million individually and million on an aggregate annual basis will require approval from the banking group 
at june   we had borrowed  from the banking group and we had  available to borrow under the line of credit agreement 
we borrowed such amounts at an average annualized interest rate of 
in order for us to continue to acquire companies in the business products distribution and the transportation services industries at the same rate as we have acquired companies since march  we will need to obtain additional sources of debt or equity capital 
as of september   we have borrowed million of the million available under the existing line of credit agreement 
should we not be able to locate additional lenders or equity partners  we will be required to limit significantly the rate at which we acquire companies 
we do not believe that this current financial condition will hinder our plans for internal growth during fiscal year inflation certain of our business product offerings  particularly paper products  have been and are expected to continue to be subject to significant price fluctuations due to inflationary and other market conditions 
in the last five to ten years  the prices for commodity grades of paper have shown considerable volatility 
we generally are able to pass any increased costs on to our customers through price increases  although we may not be able to adjust our prices immediately 
significant increases in paper and other costs in the future could materially affect our profitability if these costs cannot be passed on to customers 
in general  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year issue we have performed a review of our existing computer software and hardware information systems 
we believe that our existing management information systems are year compliant  except for certain electronic commerce matters  as described more fully in the next paragraph 
to the extent that we will be required to expend resources to ensure that the management information systems are year compliant  we do not expect that significant resources  either cash flow or manpower will be needed 
our management had previously identified two subsidiaries that had key information systems that were not year compliant 
at the first subsidiary  we have integrated their operations and information needs into precept s automated distribution information system 
for the second subsidiary  we have made the necessary programming changes to insure that the operating system will be year compliant 
we conduct a certain portion of our business operations  in particular sales orders  purchasing  billing and shipping  using electronic means of communication outside of our management information systems 
we are in the process of contacting or being contacted by our significant vendors and customers to verify that the electronic means of communication used are year compliant 
although this project is still in process  we are not aware of any significant issues in this area 
if for some reason  electronic means of communication with certain of our vendors and customers were not year compliant  we do not expect that this condition would have a material adverse effect on our operations at that time 
if necessary  we have processes and procedures in place to conduct such business operations without electronic communication for those specific customers and vendors

discontinued operations as part of our business strategy  we decided to focus on our core businesses and discontinue certain non core business operations 
during fiscal  the losses from discontinued operations consisted principally of the losses from holdings  which owned and operated certain real estate related investments

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risk ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed is interest rates on its debt 
at september   we had million of debt outstanding under our revolving line of credit which provides for interest to be charged at the prime rate or at a libor rate plus a margin of 
based on that level of outstanding revolving line of credit  a change in interest rate would result in a million annual change in interest expense 
the remainder of our debt is at fixed interest rates that are not subject to changes in interest rates 
we do not own nor are we obligated for other significant debt or equity securities that would be affected by fluctuations in market risk 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
