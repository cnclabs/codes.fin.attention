year compliance many computer systems in use today were designed and developed using two digits  rather than four  to specify years 
as a result  such systems will recognize the year as this could cause many computer applications to fail completely or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the company has conducted a review of its information technology it to identify those areas that could be affected by the year issue 
the company has developed a comprehensive risk based plan 
the plan addresses it and non it systems and products  as well as dependencies on those with whom the company does significant business

q the new order entry  inventory control  manufacturing  fulfillment  financial and point of sale systems are all year compatible 
the majority of the work to be completed relates to vendor compliance issues 
even with the above phases  the company can not guarantee that its compliant systems will not encounter difficulties when attempting to interface or interconnect with third party systems  whether or not those systems are claimed to be compliant  and the company can not guarantee that such failure to interface or interconnect will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company expects to identify any significant vendor compliance problems by the second quarter of  and to resolve those issues by the end of the third quarter despite this approach  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company is reliant will be converted timely  or that a failure by another company to convert would not have a materially adverse effect on the company 
the company presently believes  with the modifications made to existing software  the year problem will not pose significant operational risk 
while the company cannot accurately predict a worst case scenario with regard to its year issues  the failure by the company and or vendors to complete year compliance work in a timely manner could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company is in the process of assessing these risks and uncertainties and finalizing appropriate contingency plans and procedures in an attempt to minimize the effects of such a scenario 
the cost of addressing potential year problems are not currently expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations  and the company expects to incur approximately  or less in related capital expenditures in fiscal seasonality the company generally experiences peak sales in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year november through january due to the holiday season  and its lowest sales levels in its first and second fiscal quarters february through july 
the effects of seasonality are greater in the company s retail operations than in its direct marketing operations 
most operating expenses are incurred evenly throughout the year  although some selling and administrative expenses are variable with sales  and direct marketing catalog advertising expenses as a percentage of sales are higher in the first calendar quarter 
the company s quarterly operating results may also vary depending upon such factors as the opening of new stores  converting company owned to franchise stores  new catalog mailings  and the timing of new product introductions and promotions by the company 
the company s cash requirements generally reach a seasonal peak in the fall to finance increased inventory levels needed to meet third and fourth quarter sales demand 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its operations
