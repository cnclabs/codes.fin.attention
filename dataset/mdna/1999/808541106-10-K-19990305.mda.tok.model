through the november  distribution date  the businesses in the us and canada were conducted as operating divisions of kimberly clark and one of its canadian subsidiaries  respectively 
the businesses in france were conducted by ltri  a percent owned subsidiary of kimberly clark  and two indirect wholly owned kimberly clark subsidiaries  pdm and pdmal 
these latter two companies are owned by smf  which prior to the distribution was a wholly owned subsidiary of kimberly clark 
on february   sm spain  a wholly owned spanish holding company established in  acquired pirahy  a brazilian specialty paper manufacturer 
on february   sm enterprises  a second tier french subsidiary of the company  acquired a french business named ingefico  sa and its pulp and specialty paper manufacturing subsidiaries 
management believes that the following commentary and tables appropriately discuss and analyze the comparative results of operations and the financial condition of the company for the periods covered 
overview the company operates principally in the tobacco industry  manufacturing and selling papers used in the manufacturing of cigarettes  paper products used in cigarette packaging and reconstituted tobacco products 
the company s non tobacco industry products represented ten percent of the company s net sales in the non tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products  certain of which represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine operations 
the company is operated and managed based on the geographical location of its manufacturing operations the us  france and brazil 
while the products are comparable in each segment  they vary based on the technological capabilities of each of the manufacturing operations and the respective markets and customers served 
sales by a segment into markets primarily served by a different segment occur where specific product needs cannot be cost effectively met by the manufacturing operations in that segment 
for purposes of the segment disclosure in the following tables  the term united states includes operations in the us and canada 
the canadian operations only produce flax fiber used as raw material in the us operations 
the company s brazilian operations  acquired on february   and the operations of the french business acquired on february   are included in the company s consolidated financial statements since the beginning of february adjustments to net sales set forth in the following tables consist of eliminations of intercompany sales of products between segments

although unit sales volumes at the french paper operations increased during the year  excluding the french acquisition  sales volumes over the second half of the year for those operations were lower compared with the prior year period 
this second semester decline in french paper unit sales was primarily due to reduced shipments to china  russia and southeast asia because of import controls  currency convertibility and decreased demand as a result of economic conditions in those countries 
rtl volumes in france improved versus the prior year  supported in part by production from the us business unit s rtl operation at its spotswood mill  which ceased operation in the fourth quarter of sales volumes at the us business unit  excluding its rtl production for the french business  declined by a total of six percent due to reduced domestic cigarette production by the company s customers

changes in currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of approximately million 
the brazilian operations had an operating loss of million for the year primarily because of unfavorable second quarter results and the one time labor payments 
non manufacturing expenses increased by million solely caused by expenses at the two acquired companies 
excluding expenses of the acquired companies  non manufacturing expenses were the same as the prior year 
per ton wood pulp cost decreases compared with the prior year favorably impacted operating profit by million  although this benefit was offset by changes in selling prices

changes in average worldwide selling prices and sales mix had a favorable effect of million for the year 
average selling prices increased in the us compared to the prior year as a result of an improved mix of products  offsetting contractual price reductions related to a decline in the per ton cost of wood pulp 
average worldwide selling prices increased in france compared to the prior year because of an improved mix of products  offsetting slight price decreases on certain products 
operating profit operating profit improved by million for compared to the improvement was primarily a result of the increased french sales volumes  improved sales mix  better mill operations and a decline in per ton wood pulp costs 
decreases in per ton wood pulp costs favorably impacted operating profit by million compared to the prior year  although this benefit was offset by changes in selling prices 
non manufacturing expenses were million less than in the above favorable effects for the year were partially offset by lower us sales volumes  higher us manufacturing costs in and changes in currency exchange rates 
during the fourth quarter of  us operating profit decreased by approximately million from reduced operating schedules to reduce inventories 
in addition  million in start up costs were incurred during the fourth quarter of to restart operation of the us rtl production line in support of increased french sales volumes 
changes in currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of million on the operating profit change 
non operating expenses the increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily a result of increased debt related to acquisitions in brazil and france in february and higher interest rates 
interest expense in and was primarily associated with debt incurred in connection with the distribution see liquidity and capital resources 
the decline in interest expense in as compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates  currency translation rate changes and a lower average amount of debt outstanding 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the company s term loans was approximately percent in  percent in and percent in other income  net in  and consisted primarily of interest income from investment of cash generated by operations of the company and royalty income 
income taxes the noncurrent deferred income tax asset is primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards nols incurred through december  by other businesses of kimberly clark in france previously owned by smf 
prior to the spin off  those other kimberly clark businesses were merged and distributed to kimberly clark 
under french tax law  the nols of those other businesses were retained by smf 
the smf consolidated tax group in france has not paid income taxes  except nominal amounts of minimum required income taxes  in the periods presented in the financial statements and is not expected to pay normal income taxes until the nols have been fully utilized 
additionally  the noncurrent deferred income tax asset as of december  includes amounts related to nols of swm b  some of which were obtained in the acquisition of this brazilian business 
additional information concerning these nols is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the effective income tax rates for the years ended december   and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in included the benefit of a reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against certain french deferred income tax assets arising from nols 
this adjustment reduced the deferred provision for income taxes by million in the second quarter of the reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded because of continued earnings and projected future earnings at the french businesses that utilize the nols  reducing the uncertainty that these nols will be fully utilized in the future 
excluding the impact of this adjustment  the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  would have been percent 
the provision for income taxes in was impacted by an increase in the effective statutory income tax rate enacted in france during november from percent to percent for and  retroactive to january   and to percent for the unfavorable effect on current taxes of the tax rate increase  including a retroactive adjustment for the eleven month period ended november   was offset by the favorable effect on the deferred provision for income taxes due to the increased value of the tax benefits to be recognized from the nols retained by smf estimated to be realized during  and  the periods of the higher income tax rates 
the impact in attributable to deferred tax assets  net of liabilities  was a favorable million on the deferred provision for income taxes 
also impacting the provision for income taxes was the enactment in france during december of a law that eliminated taxation of a provision for the fluctuating value of raw materials that had been included in french deferred taxes 
cancellation of this deferred tax liability reduced the provision for income taxes by million  which was partially offset by establishment of a million reserve for a previously reported tax claim in france 
see additional information concerning this tax claim in note to the consolidated financial statements 
including the effect of the change in french income tax rates on the current provision for income taxes  but excluding the effect on the deferred provision for income taxes  and excluding the effect of the elimination of taxation of a provision for fluctuating value of raw materials and the reserve for the tax claim  the effective income tax rate would have been percent 
the increase from this adjusted rate of percent to the above adjusted percent effective income tax rate is due to a greater proportion of the company s earnings being in france which has higher income tax rates than other countries in which the company operates 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  us in millions cash provided by used for changes in operating working capital operations capital spending capitalized software costs the company s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations  which is principally obtained through operating earnings 
impacting the cash flow from operations are changes in operating working capital 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million  excluding the acquired working capital balances of the brazilian and french businesses acquired in in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million due principally to lower accounts payable 
accounts payable were lower in compared to as a result of payments in early for several large capital project and purchased software costs included in accounts payable at december  during  the cash flow impact of lower accounts receivable  due to the timing of collections  offset the impact of higher inventory levels 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed favorably to cash flow by million primarily due to decreases in inventories as a result of lower inventory levels and lower per ton wood pulp costs  decreases in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections  and increases in accounts payable primarily for several large capital expenditures included in accounts payable at december  cash flow from operations during these periods exceeded the level of capital spending 
capital spending in included i million toward the expansion of converted tipping paper capacity at the malaucene  france mill  ii million toward speed ups of both rtl machines and replacement of a yankee dryer hood at the spay  france mill  iii million for speed up of a paper machine at the quimperle  france mill  iv million to modify a paper machine at the newly acquired st 
girons mill  v million toward upgrades to a paper machine at the spotswood mill  vi million to upgrade a coating machine at the newly acquired pirahy mill  and vii million toward improvements at the quimperle pulping facility 
capital spending in included i million to complete the new long fiber paper machine at the quimperle mill  ii million at the ancram mill toward upgrading the forming section of a long fiber paper machine  iii million for equipment necessary to temporarily restart operation of the rtl production line at the spotswood mill  iv million toward an effluent biological treatment station at the quimperle mill  v million to complete upgrading the flax pulping operations at the spotswood mill  and vi million toward a paper machine upgrade project at the spotswood mill 
capital spending in included i million for the new long fiber paper machine at the quimperle mill  ii million at the quimperle mill for a production reorganization project  iii million to complete the installation of new high speed cigarette paper converting equipment at the spotswood mill  iv million toward upgrading the flax pulping operations at the spotswood mill  and v million to furnish the company s newly leased corporate and us business unit headquarters and us research facilities 
in addition to capital spending  the company incurred  and deferred on the balance sheet  additional software development costs of million in  related to new integrated information systems in france and the us these systems replaced the kimberly clark systems formerly used in the us in february  two acquisitions of tobacco related paper suppliers were completed 
on february   sm spain paid approximately million in cash for percent ownership interest in pirahy 
in connection with the acquisition of pirahy  the company modified its existing credit agreement to provide a million term loan to sm spain 
sm spain borrowed the remaining funds for the transaction from smf  which in turn utilized its existing cash balances and borrowings from its revolving credit facilities 
additionally  on february   sm enterprises paid million french francs approximately million in cash and assumed approximately million in existing net debt for all of the outstanding shares of ingefico  sa and percent of the outstanding shares of its pulp and specialty paper manufacturing subsidiaries  groupe sapam and papeteries de la moulasse sa subsequently  sm enterprises acquired all the remaining shares of groupe sapam for million in cash 
in december  the company announced that the board of directors had authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock during the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million

the company has declared and paid quarterly dividends  each amounting to million per share  since the second quarter of management currently expects to continue this level of quarterly dividend 
other than expenditures associated with environmental matters see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as of december  the company had unrecorded outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
in addition to capital spending  the company is incurring software development costs related to new integrated computer systems that replaced in the us the formerly used kimberly clark systems beginning january the portion of software development costs which were capitalized beginning in totaled million through and were deferred on the balance sheet until such systems are placed in service see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the us  where the largest portion of the costs to date have been incurred  most of the deferred costs began amortizing at the beginning of over a period of seven years using the straight line method 
the company will continue to incur costs in france in and as software modules are purchased  designed and installed 
as of december   the company had approximately million still available under its revolving credit facilities in the us and france  and on january   the company renewed these facilities to january  the company also has other bank credit facilities available in the us  france and brazil 
the company believes its cash flow from operations  together with borrowings still available under its revolving and other credit facilities  will be sufficient to fund its ongoing cash requirements

outlook the difficult market conditions experienced in the second half of are continuing 
us cigarette consumption is being impacted by adverse publicity and by increases in the retail selling price of cigarettes 
us cigarette consumption and the export of cigarettes manufactured in the united states declined in from prior year levels 
continued lower sales to china  russia and southeast asia are expected for the foreseeable future due to import controls  currency convertibility and decreased demand 
with weakness in demand  pricing has come under pressure in some markets 
the uncertain pricing environment for the company s paper products is expected to continue into due to market conditions and the results of global pricing negotiations with multi national cigarette manufacturers 
with weakening demand for the company s paper products  some production downtime was taken during the fourth quarter of in france  the united states and brazil to manage inventory levels 
the company entered with what management believes is an appropriate level of inventories and expects less production downtime and improved operations in the first half of compared with the fourth quarter of compared with the prior year  the company s net sales will benefit in the first quarter of from sales by companies acquired in brazil and france in february of the company continues to integrate these acquisitions 
earnings of the company s brazilian operations are expected to improve during the company s objective is to achieve at least break even operating profit at that business unit 
the recent devaluation of the brazilian real is expected to have a positive impact on the company s brazilian operations since some of its sales in brazil are tied to us dollar selling prices 
the ultimate impact the currency devaluation will have on the economy of brazil remains uncertain 
changes in both inflation rates and economic growth rates could have a future impact on the brazilian business 
cost savings are expected to continue from recently implemented capital projects and from various cost savings programs  including the spotswood mill restructuring program that was announced in the second quarter of and the recent change in the brazilian operations 
with the uncertain market conditions  the company is making cost improvement a major priority in each of its business units 
the per ton cost of wood pulp declined during the company does not expect significant increases or decreases in the per ton cost of wood pulp during  although per ton wood pulp costs may be somewhat lower during the first half of the year compared to the levels during the first half of the french corporate income tax rate will decline from percent in to percent in the amortization of capitalized software costs and operating expenses related to the new integrated computer systems in the us will continue in at approximately the same level as in the company expects to incur to million of capitalized software costs in  primarily in france  and an additional to million of capitalized software costs in start up of the new systems in france will occur in phases  commencing in mid the company expects capital spending for to be approximately million  focused primarily on internal capacity expansion  product quality improvements and cost reduction opportunities 
in the second quarter of  the company initiated an expansion of the malaucene mill  which is expected to increase the mill s capacity for finished tipping paper by approximately percent and should be completed in the second half of capital spending in will also include spending for a million project authorized to increase reconstituted tobacco leaf rtl production capacity at the spay  france mill by approximately percent 
with the authorization of this project  current inventory levels and customer order patterns  the decision was made to cease production of rtl products at the spotswood mill in the fourth quarter of the spotswood rtl production line had been temporarily restarted during the fourth quarter of to support the french rtl operation until a plan for adding permanent rtl capacity was developed 
factors that may affect future results many factors outside the control of the company could impact the company s results 
the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
year compliance historically  many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors utilize computer programs written using two digits to represent the year rather than four digits 
these programs may not properly recognize a year xx 
as a result  these programs may be unable to accurately process certain data before  during or after the year and could result in major governmental and business systems failures or miscalculations causing disruptions in operations 
this problem is commonly referred to as the year issue 
because of the numerous information systems  mill process controls and operating systems  and vendors and service providers that the company uses  as well as the company s many customers and customer locations around the world  the company anticipates that there may be some disruption in its business due to the year issue 
due to the interdependent nature of the company and its systems with those of so many customers  vendors and service providers  such as fuel oil suppliers and electric utilities  as well as domestic and foreign governmental agencies  the company and its operating subsidiaries are exposed to many possible systems failures or processing errors 
as a result  the company and its operating subsidiaries could be materially adversely affected if utilities  private businesses and governmental agencies with which they do business or that provide essential materials or services are not year compliant 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would be temporary mill closings  delays in the receipt of supplies  delays in the delivery of its products  delays in collection of amounts due the company  delays in payment of amounts owed by the company to others  and delays in receipt of needed services 
as a consequence of one or more of these scenarios  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by a temporary inability to conduct its business in the ordinary course for some period of time 
however  the company believes that its plans  including its contingency planning discussed below should minimize the adverse effect of any such business disruptions if they should occur 
each of the company s business segments has inventoried its business operations  assessed its susceptibility to system failures or processing errors as a result of year issues and developed a plan to address those issues  focusing on three elements information systems software and hardware  mill process controls and operating systems  and vendors and service providers 
each element is being subdivided according to risk potential of high  medium and low 
high risk is defined as being critical to uninterrupted operation of the business 
medium risk is defined as being necessary to support the business but temporary work arounds can be accomplished 
low risk is defined as being minor inconveniences that should not impact the company s business 
those issues which are considered most critical to continuing operations are being given the highest priority 
on january   the company s us operations  including the research and headquarters areas  began utilizing new integrated information systems to replace the kimberly clark systems formerly used in the us a benefit of the new systems is that they are expected to provide year compliance in the area of information systems 
in the us  mill process controls and operating systems have been reviewed for nearly  pieces of equipment and systems 
only six high risk equipment or systems issues have been identified 
for these issues  modification requirements and a schedule for compliance have been developed with the applicable equipment and systems vendors 
such corrective action is expected to be completed during the third quarter of the company s french businesses have inventoried and evaluated all their information systems 
approximately one fourth of these information systems are believed to be year compliant 
upon implementation in mid of certain new integrated computer systems in france  substantially all of the french businesses information systems are expected to be year compliant 
less than three percent of the approximately  pieces of mill process control equipment and operating systems will require modification or replacement 
adequate progress has occurred to date  with several modifications and replacements already completed 
such corrective action is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company s brazilian business has inventoried and evaluated all of its information systems 
nine of its systems will require modifications to become year compliant 
upgrades for all nine systems have been developed and are expected to be implemented by the end of the second quarter of of its mill process control equipment and operating systems  ten will require modification and upgrades for these systems have been developed 
the required modifications for nine of the ten systems have already been implemented  and the required modifications for the remaining system are expected to be implemented by the end of the second quarter of inquiries have been mailed to vendors and service providers for the company s us  french and brazilian operations as to the status of their year compliance 
thus far  approximately one half have responded 
second requests have been sent to those vendors and service providers that had not yet responded to the first inquiry and to those whose responses were incomplete or inadequate 
critical vendors and suppliers are being contacted either by phone or in person to review the status of their year compliance plans 
coincident with the actions described above  the company and its operating subsidiaries are developing and evaluating contingency plans to further mitigate the effects of possible disruptions that may occur and are developing and evaluating related cost estimates for such plans 
all of the company s operations are assessing the need for alternative supply arrangements and increased inventory levels of raw materials  supplies and finished goods  as well as other possible measures based on the responses from vendors and service providers 
contingency plans will be developed to try to reasonably ensure that operations are not interrupted and unexpected costs are minimized 
however  there can be no assurances that all possible negative consequences can be identified and avoided 
the company presently plans to address each of its systems which are critical to its operations by the end of the second quarter of the company currently estimates that the total cost of implementing its year compliance plans will be in the range of to million  substantially all to be incurred in  excluding the costs of the new integrated computer systems 
approximately two thirds of this amount is expected to be expensed and one third included in capital projects 
these preliminary estimates are subject to change  since they are based on presently available information  and will be updated as the company continues its assessments  proceeds with implementation of modifications and replacements necessary to become compliant  receives further feedback from vendors and service providers and formulates reasonable and necessary contingency plans 
euro currency conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legal currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company established a committee to identify and implement changes necessary to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  competitive implications of increased price transparency within european union countries  changes in currency exchange costs and rate exposures  continuity of contracts that require payment in a legal currency  and tax implications of the conversion 
the company s french subsidiaries currently utilize multi currency software that was capable of euro denominated sales and purchase transactions on january  consideration has also been given to other potential issues in connection with the conversion  including those mentioned above 
the company does not anticipate any significant negative consequences of these issues and does not anticipate that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
international business risks the company s international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export controls and restrictions  exchange controls  inflationary economies  currency risks and risks related to the restrictions of repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
tax and repatriation matters the company is subject to income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
the company makes a comprehensive review of the income tax requirements of each of its operations  files appropriate returns and makes appropriate income tax planning analyses directed toward the minimization of its income tax obligations in these countries 
appropriate income tax provisions are determined on an individual subsidiary level and at the corporate level on both an interim and annual basis 
these processes are followed using an appropriate combination of internal staff at both the subsidiary and corporate levels as well as independent outside advisors in review of the various tax laws and in compliance reporting for the various operations 
dividend distributions are regularly made to the us from certain foreign subsidiaries and are appropriately considered in the provision for us income taxes 
the company intends for the undistributed earnings of certain other foreign subsidiaries to be reinvested indefinitely 
these undistributed earnings are not subject to either additional foreign income taxes or us income taxes unless remitted as dividends 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us taxes on those earnings 
the company regularly reviews the status of the accumulated earnings of each of its foreign subsidiaries and reevaluates the aforementioned dividend policy as part of its overall financing plans 
hedging activities and foreign currency exchange risks management selectively hedges the company s foreign currency risks  as well as its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt  when it is practical and cost effective to do so 
the instruments used to hedge foreign currency risks are forward contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
these instruments are purchased from well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually  the contracts extend for no more than months  although their contractual term has been as long as months 
management believes that credit risks with respect to the counterparties and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged  were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts  are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
in addition to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates on operating profit  foreign currency gains and losses have arisen from the remeasurement of non local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the operation is domiciled 
these gains and losses  related primarily to trade receivable and payable balances  are included in other income  net 
additional information concerning foreign currency related matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s cost structure 
effect of changing pulp costs per ton pulp costs tend to be cyclical in nature and are a large component of product costs 
the company consumed approximately  metric tons of wood pulp in  including requirements of the newly acquired companies  and  and  metric tons of wood pulp in and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of the primary pulp grade used by the company  northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  ranged from a low of per metric ton to a high of per metric ton 
generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased per ton pulp costs and has generally reduced them when pulp costs have significantly declined 
the company may or may not be able to fully recover future pulp cost increases  or fully retain future pulp cost decreases  in its sales pricing structure 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the us and brazil 
in the us  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season through much of january and february 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
the company  or its predecessor  has been named as a potentially responsible party at several waste disposal sites  none of which  individually  or in the aggregate  in management s opinion  is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that such an effect will not occur at some future time 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company is involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and its subsidiaries  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in approximately countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities  particularly in the us  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers have increased prices of cigarettes significantly over the course of the last approximately months 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases which  in turn  decreases demand for the company s products 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry
