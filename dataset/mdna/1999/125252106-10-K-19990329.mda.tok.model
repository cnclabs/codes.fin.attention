net income the fourth quarter sales for and have been stronger than the third quarter sales  primarily due to the growth in printed coating products as consumers make holiday purchases of ready to assemble furniture 
offsetting this increase  however  is a seasonal decrease in pharmaceutical product sales  as people typically defer elective surgeries between thanksgiving and new year s 
in addition  many of the company s customers attempt to reduce their inventories prior to the calendar year end 
consequently  first quarter sales are typically stronger than the preceding fourth quarter 
the gross profit in the second quarter of was lower due to the company s holographic capacity constraint  which caused the company to purchase material from its former holographic joint venture partner at a low margin to the company 
this capacity constraint was addressed with the company s purchase of a second wide holographic embossing machine 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of working capital have been net cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings under various loan agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
cash at year end increased from million in to million in the cash increase was primarily the result of two factors the reduction of inventories through better management of stocking levels and cost reductions  and the company s renegotiated mortgage  which resulted in an additional 
million of cash 
offsetting these increases to cash  the company invested  in new equipment 
additionally  net trade receivables were up by  primarily as a result of the increased sales levels in the company s capital expenditures totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and respectively  and included the payments for the new wide printing press in and the company previously made s corporation dividends to its previous s corporation stockholders of  in the year ended december   to fund their income tax liabilities on the company s net income and the repayment of stockholder loans incurred prior to the initial public offering of the common stock 
in june  the company received loan availability of approximately  pursuant to an illinois revenue bond financing  which matures in the loan proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of a new wide printing press and related plant additions to ensure capacity for the continued growth of the company s printed products line 
at december   the entire amount had been borrowed 
the company incurred  of costs associated with the issuance of the bonds  which are being amortized over twelve years 
on september   the company also issued to the seller of nbnc  a ten year  subordinated note in the principal amount of million  which is convertible in whole or in part  at the option of the holder beginning after the first anniversary of that note  into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
on november   the company renegotiated the mortgage on its land and building by repaying it s existing outstanding mortgage and replacing it with a five year fixed interest rate loan  in the principle amount of  the company and its subsidiaries have various revolving credit arrangements that provide for maximum borrowings of approximately  under these revolving credit arrangements  interest is payable at either the respective bank s prime rate and at december  and  respectively or over the bank of england s sterling base rate and at december  and  respectively 
the revolving credit arrangements expire at various dates in no amounts were outstanding under the company s main credit line of million at december  and the company is required to pay a quarterly fee for the unused portion on one of its facilities at an amount equal to 
times the daily average of the unused portion 
such payments in  and were not significant 
on january   the company repurchased  shares from a former officer for the total consideration of  less  for repayment of a promissory note the officer owed to the company 
additional on the open market in december  the company repurchased  shares for a total consideration of  the company believes that the net cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the credit facility are sufficient to finance the company s growth 
seasonality and impact of inflation historically  the company has experienced lower net sales levels during the fourth quarter and increased net sales levels during the following first quarter 
this is due to typical year end depletion of inventories by the company s customers 
it is also due in large part to the holidays at the end of the year  as the company s customers have an increased number of holiday plant closings 
in addition  fourth quarter pharmaceutical product sales generally are lower as a result of the postponement of elective surgeries during holiday periods 
however  due to the strong growth of printed products for use in the ready to assemble furniture market  the fourth quarter sales have been greater than the third quarter sales in each of the last two years 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or income to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future
