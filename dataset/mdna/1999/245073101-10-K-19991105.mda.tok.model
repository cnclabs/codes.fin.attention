overview the company s net sales have increased as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions 
the company has completed five acquisitions in the past six years dynarad a designer and manufacturer of medical imaging systems and critical electronic subsystems in fiscal  bertan a designer and manufacturer of precision high voltage power supplies and instrumentation for medical and industrial applications in fiscal  gendex del a designer and manufacturer of medical imaging systems in fiscal  x ray technologies  inc a designer and manufacturer of medical imaging systems in fiscal and acoma medical imaging inc a designer and manufacturer of medical imaging systems in fiscal the company s net sales have increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal during the past five years the company has grown internally and through acquisitions into a company whose predominant business is serving the medical imaging and diagnostic markets 
the company s net sales attributable to medical imaging products have increased from approximately million or of total net sales in fiscal to approximately million or of total net sales and approximately million or of total net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
management believes that recent cost containment trends in the healthcare industry have created opportunities for its cost effective medical imaging systems and subsystems in domestic and international markets 
some of these trends are increased demand for lower cost medical equipment  outsourcing of systems and critical electronic subsystems by leading oems  increased demand for certain diagnostic procedures and lower cost medical services in the global marketplace 
general the following discussion and analysis examines the major factors contributing to the company s financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended july   august  and august  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document 
for segment reporting purposes  the company has organized its operations into two segments medical imaging systems and critical electronic subsystems 
the critical electronic subsystems segment includes sales of critical electronic subsystems for medical applications which are classified as medical imaging products  but which are manufactured within this segment  of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal years ended july   august  and august  aggregate sales of medical products were approximately million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal years ended july   august  and august  results of operations fiscal years  and net sales for the medical imaging systems segment were approximately million for fiscal compared to approximately million for fiscal  an increase of 
net sales for the medical imaging systems segment for fiscal were approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal  an increase of 
these increases in the medical imaging systems sales in both years were due to the acceleration of the outsourcing trend by major medical equipment companies and increased demand for the company s medical imaging systems 
net sales for the critical electronic subsystems segment for fiscal were approximately million compared to approximately million for fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease of sales in critical electronic subsystems was due to a decrease in sales for critical electronic subsystems used in semi conductor equipment manufacturing and oil exploration
