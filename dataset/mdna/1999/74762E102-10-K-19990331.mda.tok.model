introduction quanta derives its revenues from one reportable segment by providing specialty contracting and maintenance services related to electric and telecommunications infrastructure  installing transportation control and lighting systems  and providing specialty contracting services to the commercial and industrial markets 
our services include the installation  repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution lines  telecommunication lines and cable television lines  the construction of electric substations  the erection of cellular telephone  pcs r and microwave towers  the installation of highway lighting and traffic control systems  specialized underground construction including underground fueling systems  design and engineering services  as well as the provision of specialty contracting services for electric  video  security  fire  voice and data systems 
our customers include electric utilities  telecommunication and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors and owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties 
including all companies we acquired prior to december   we had pro forma combined revenues for the year ended december  of million  of which was attributable to electric utility infrastructure services  was attributable to telecommunications infrastructure services  was attributable to transportation control and lighting systems services and was attributable to commercial and industrial services 
quanta enters into contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids  the final terms and prices of which we frequently negotiate with the customer 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  the contracts are usually on either a lump sum or unit price basis in which we agree to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project lump sum or for units of work performed unit price 
we complete most installation projects within one year  while we frequently provide maintenance and repair work under open ended  unit price master service agreements which are renewable annually 
we generally record revenues from lump sum contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
quanta recognizes revenue when services are performed except when work is being performed under a fixed price or cost plus fee contract 
such contracts generally provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate us for services rendered  measured typically in terms of units installed  hours expended or some other measure of progress 
some of our customers require us to post performance and payment bonds upon execution of the contract  depending upon the nature of the work to be performed 
our fixed price contracts often include payment provisions pursuant to which the customer withholds a to retainage from each progress payment and forwards the retainage to us upon completion and approval of the work 
costs of services consist primarily of salaries and benefits to employees  depreciation  fuel and other vehicle expenses  equipment rentals  subcontracted services  materials  parts and supplies 
quanta s gross margin  which is gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues  is typically higher on projects where labor  rather than materials  constitutes a greater portion of the cost of services 
labor costs can be predicted with relatively less accuracy than materials costs 
therefore  to compensate for the potential variability of labor costs  we seek to maintain higher margins on labor intensive projects 
certain of our subsidiaries were previously subject to deductibles ranging from  to  for workers compensation insurance 
fluctuations in insurance accruals related to this deductible could have an impact on gross margins in the period in which such adjustments are made 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to management  administrative salaries and benefits  marketing  office rent and utilities  communications and professional fees 
the acquired businesses have operated throughout the pre acquisition periods presented as independent  privately owned entities  and their results of operations reflect varying tax structures s corporations or c corporations which have influenced the historical level of owners compensation 
gross profits and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues may not be comparable among the individual acquired businesses 
in connection with quanta s acquisitions  certain owners of the businesses we have acquired through december  have agreed to reductions in their compensation and related benefits totaling million and million lower than and levels  respectively 
such reductions have been reflected in the terms of the employment agreements entered into between us and these persons 
quanta believes that it will realize savings from consolidation of insurance and bonding programs  reduction in other selling  general and administrative expenses such as training  marketing  communications and professional fees  our ability to borrow at lower interest rates than most  if not all  of the acquired businesses  consolidation of operations in certain locations  and greater volume discounts from suppliers of materials  parts and supplies 
we anticipate that additional costs related to our new corporate infrastructure  operating as a public company and integrating the acquired businesses will partially offset these savings 
we believe that neither these savings nor the costs associated therewith can be quantified at this time as there have been limited combined operating results upon which to base any assumptions 
as a result  these savings and associated costs have not been included in the pro forma financial information included herein 
the acquisition of the founding companies excluding par and the purchased companies have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the excess amount we paid  including liabilities assumed  for such businesses acquired prior to december   over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of these businesses of million has been recorded as goodwill 
in addition  goodwill of million has been recorded attributable to the  shares of limited vote common stock issued to initial stockholders and management 
together  this goodwill  totaling million  will be amortized over its estimated useful life of years as a non cash charge to operating income 
the pro forma effect of this amortization expense  the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes  is expected to be approximately million per year 
seasonality  fluctuations of quarterly results quanta s results of operations can be subject to seasonal variations 
during the winter months  demand for new projects and maintenance services may be lower due to reduced construction activity 
however  demand for repair and maintenance services attributable to damage caused by inclement weather during the winter months may partially offset the loss of revenues from lower demand for new projects and maintenance services 
additionally  the industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new projects in various geographic regions in the us typically  we experience lower gross margins and operating margins during the winter months 
the timing of acquisitions  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs and regional economic conditions may also materially affect quarterly results 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
liquidity and capital resources in february  quanta completed its ipo  which involved the issuance of  shares of common stock at a price of per share before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
in march  quanta sold an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions pursuant to the underwriters overallotment option 
we realized proceeds from these transactions  net of the discounts and after deducting the expenses of the ipo  of approximately million 
of this amount  we used million to fund the cash portion of the purchase price relating to the acquisition of the founding companies 
as of december   quanta had cash and cash equivalents of million  working capital of million and long term debt of million  net of current maturities  including borrowings of million under the credit facility  and the company had million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
in addition  the company had million of convertible subordinated notes 
during the year ended december   operating activities provided a net cash flow of million 
changes in working capital accounts are driven predominantly by the acquisitions throughout the year and as such are not comparable to prior periods 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  including million used for the purchase of businesses  net of cash acquired 
financing activities provided a net cash flow of million  resulting primarily from million of net proceeds from the ipo  million from net borrowings under our credit facility  million of net proceeds from issuance of the convertible subordinated notes  partially offset by million in repayments of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions and cash payments of million representing cash consideration paid to the stockholders of par 
in august  we amended our million credit facility to increase it to million 
in november  we expanded our bank group from two banks to nine banks and amended the credit facility to increase it to million 
we pledged all of the capital stock of our material operating subsidiaries and the majority of our assets to secure the credit facility 
the purpose of the credit facility is to provide funds to be used for working capital  to finance acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a the london interbank offered rate libor which was at december  plus to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility or b the bank s prime rate which was at december  plus up to  as determined by the ratio of our total funded debt to ebitda 
we incur commitment fees of to based on certain financial ratios on any unused borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
quanta s existing and future subsidiaries will guarantee the repayment of all amounts due under the credit facility  and the credit facility restricts pledges of all material assets 
the credit facility contains usual and customary covenants for a credit facility of this nature including the prohibition of the payment of dividends  certain financial ratios and indebtedness covenants and a requirement to obtain the consent of the lenders for acquisitions exceeding a certain level of cash consideration 
as of march   we had approximately million outstanding under the credit facility and million of letters of credit outstanding  resulting in a borrowing availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
additionally  on october   we issued and sold million of convertible subordinated notes bearing interest at to enron capital and one of its affiliates 
we used the proceeds of the convertible subordinated notes to reduce outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
the convertible subordinated notes include restrictive covenants substantially similar to those included in the credit facility 
the convertible subordinated notes are convertible into common stock at any time at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the convertible subordinated notes are nonredeemable for four years and are redeemable thereafter at our option at a redemption price which is initially per principal amount  with such premium declining ratably over the succeeding four years 
the convertible subordinated notes are mandatorily redeemable in nine semi annual installments beginning in june upon a change in control  the convertible subordinated notes are mandatorily redeemable at a redemption price which is initially per principal amount  with such premium declining ratably over eight years following the date of issuance 
the company issued shares of common stock to an employee stock ownership plan the esop in connection with the acquisition of the pooled company 
the esop was terminated on july   and pending a favorable determination letter from the internal revenue service  a portion of the shares of the company s common stock held by the esop will be sold to repay debt owed by the esop to the company and the remaining portion of the unallocated shares will be distributed to its participants 
the cost of the unallocated esop shares is reflected as a reduction in the company s stockholders equity 
upon distribution from the esop  the company will owe an excise tax equal to of the value of the company s common stock distributed 
in addition  the company will eliminate the remaining balance reflected as unearned esop shares on the company s balance sheet and will have to recognize a non cash non recurring compensation charge equal to the value of the unallocated shares held by the esop at the time it allocates and distributes such shares 
we currently cannot determine the amount of the excise tax that will be owed or the non cash  non recurring compensation charge that will be recognized 
however  based on the closing price of our common stock on december   the amount of such charges would be approximately  and  respectively 
in january  we completed our second public offering of common stock  which included the issuance of  shares of common stock including  shares pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option at a price of per share before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
we realized proceeds from this transaction  net of the discounts and after deducting the expenses of the offering  of approximately million 
of this amount  we used million to repay outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility and the remainder to acquire additional businesses 
in addition to the founding companies  through march   we have acquired companies for an aggregate consideration of million shares of common stock and million in cash and notes 
the cash portion of such consideration was provided by borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from the ipo and our second public offering of common stock 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we intend to continue our aggressive acquisition program  and to continue to use a combination of cash and common stock to finance the principal part of the consideration payable in acquisitions 
we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and the credit facility will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures for property and equipment for at least the next months 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december   and  inflation did not have a significant effect on the results of quanta or any of the acquired businesses 
year impact of year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance  but systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
state of readiness 
we have assessed our year issues and have developed a plan to address both the information technology it and non it systems issues 
we have not developed any of the systems we use in our business  consequently  we believe our year issues relate to systems that different vendors have developed and sold to us 
we assess year issues relating to the operating and other systems of all business we may acquire 
since our acquisition program is ongoing  our assessment of potential year issues is not complete 
we have circulated a formal questionnaire to all of our significant suppliers  customers and service providers to determine the extent to which quanta is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate the year problem 
we have received assurances of year compliance from many of our suppliers  customers and service providers  including the providers of most of our computer systems and the providers of financial services to us 
because of the nature of our business and the number of vendors available to us  we believe that our operations will not be significantly disrupted even if third parties with whom we have relationships are not year compliant 
costs to address the year issue 
we have not identified any material systems which are not year compliant  although four of our acquired businesses have systems which are not year compliant 
we plan to have replacements for these systems operational by december   at an estimated cost of  as part of our previously planned systems integration program which will be funded from cash flows from operations 
to date  costs incurred to address year compliance have been internal in nature and have been charged to income as incurred 
we have not delayed any it projects due to our year compliance program 
risks to the company and contingency plan 
in the worst case scenario  if the replacements and modifications are not completed  our operating subsidiaries may experience temporary problems with certain computer systems that contain date critical functions 
we believe that any temporary disruptions from the failures of our own systems would not be material to our overall business or results of operations 
however  should our customers experience a sustained period of unanticipated disruption because of year problems  our customers may delay the award of new contracts or payment for work already completed  and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
as a contingency plan  immediately prior to january   we intend to maintain an adequate supply of fuel and spare parts so that we can continue to operate normally until such time as any temporary year problems related to our operations are remedied 
the company will continue throughout to consider the likelihood of a material business interruption due to the year issue 
while we have made a careful assessment of both our own internal operating systems and the year compliance of our suppliers  customer and service providers  because of the complexity of the problem  we cannot be certain that all of our own systems and those of third parties with whom we operate will be made year compliant in a timely manner or that any such failure to be year compliant will not materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations for financial statement presentation purposes  as required by the rules and regulations of the securities act  par has been identified as the accounting acquiror 
as such  the financial statements of quanta for periods prior to february  are the financial statements of par as restated for the acquisition of the pooled company 
the operations of the other founding companies have been included in our historical financial statements beginning february  and the operations of the purchased companies have been included from their respective acquisition dates

gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a larger amount of high margin storm and emergency work performed by par in compared to  and the acquisition of the founding and purchased companies which earned lower margins than those experienced by par and the pooled company in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   due to the acquisition of the founding companies on february   the acquisition of the purchased companies  increases in selling and administrative salaries required to support the higher level of revenues generated from an increased volume of projects  and the establishment of a corporate office and administrative infrastructure during as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to excess compensation paid to the owners of par in as compared to agreed upon salary levels at the date of the ipo and due to the pooled company having a higher sales commission structure than the founding and purchased companies 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  due to interest expense attributable to higher levels of debt resulting from cash paid and debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain acquired businesses 
in addition  the company borrowed funds under the credit facility for equipment purchases and other operating activities in connection with the addition of the purchased companies during also  interest expense increased due to the addition of the convertible subordinated notes  partially offset by lower overall effective borrowing rates in versus quanta results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues

gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased from to 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin is primarily due to increased labor productivity  renegotiated unit pricing on certain long term contracts and lower equipment rental expense as par replaced rental equipment on certain projects with company owned equipment  partially offset by lower gross profit from operations in oregon due to the completion of a significant telecommunications contract in at a lower gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased administrative support required by the higher level of revenues and increases in owner compensation  partially offset by decreased commissions paid to salesmen

other income expense  net 
other income expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  due to interest expense incurred on higher levels of debt required in to fund additional equipment purchases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
therefore  our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
our debt with fixed interest rates primarily consists of convertible subordinated notes 
our debt with variable interest rates is primarily the credit facility
