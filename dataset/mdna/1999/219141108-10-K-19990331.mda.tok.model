item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company provides integrated facility development  design  construction and operational services to governmental agencies within three operating divisions i secure institutional correctional and detention services  ii juvenile treatmen  educational and detention services and iii pre release correctional services 
the following table sets forth total offender capacity  the contracted offender capacity and beds in operation at the end of the periods shown  and the average occupancy percentage for the year then ended 
december  total offender capacity residential    non residential community based  total    contracted offender capacity in operation end of period    contracted beds in operation end of period    average occupancy based on contracted beds in operation occupancy percentages are based on contracted offender capacity of residential facilities in operation 
since certain facilities have offender capacities that exceed contracted capacities  occupancy percentages can exceed of contracted capacity 
for any applicable facilities  includes reduced occupancy during the start up phase 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from operating correctional  detention and pre release facilities for federal  state and local governmental agencies in the united states 
revenues for operation of correctional  detention and pre release facilities are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days for the period 
factors which the company considers in determining the per diem rate to charge include i the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  ii wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  iii whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and iv the anticipated average occupancy levels which the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
the company s operating margins generally vary from facility to facility regardless of whether the facility is secure institutional  juvenile or pre release based on the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility and the anticipated changes in operating costs  if any  over the term of the contract 
the company is responsible for all facility operating expenses  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to facilities for which the company has only a management contract six facilities in operation at december a majority of the company s facility operating expenses consist of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating expenses increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating expenses  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
the company s largest single operating expense  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust the staffing and payroll to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  but a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  accounting  finance  human resources  payroll  information systems and other services  and costs of business development 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving offenders 
offenders are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to three month period 
the company may incur start up operating losses at new facilities until break even occupancy levels are reached 
quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company s commencing management of a new facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
results of operations the company s historical operating results reflect a significant expansion of the company s business since material fluctuations in the company s results of operations are principally the result of the timing and effect of acquisitions  the level of development activity conducted by the company  and occupancy rates at company operated facilities 
the company s acquisitions to date have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the operating results of the acquired businesses have been reported in the company s operating results since the date of acquisition 
the company s income from operations as a percentage of revenues fluctuates depending on the relative mix of operating contracts among the company s three operating divisions

treasury stock 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of common stock on the open market under a share repurchase program at an aggregate cost of  acquisitions 
in january  the company acquired the great plains correctional facility 
the company financed the million purchase price with a combination of million in borrowings under the credit facility and the proceeds from the october stock offering and cash generated from operations 
in august  the company acquired substantially all of the alaskan assets of allvest  a privately held company based in anchorage  alaska 
the company financed the million purchase price with borrowings under the credit facility 
the acquisition included the operations of five pre release facilities with an aggregate capacity of beds in anchorage  fairbanks and bethel  alaska  and the real properties of three of the five facilities 
in addition  the company and allvest agreed to enter into a cooperative venture to jointly pursue the development of a private prison in delta junction  alaska 
management of the company believes that the cash flows generated from operations  together with the credit available under the credit facility and operating lease capacity thereunder  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s committed capital and working capital requirements for the near term 
it is not anticipated that the credit facility will provide sufficient financing to fund construction costs related to future secure institutional contract awards  expansions or significant future acquisitions 
the company anticipates obtaining additional sources of financing to fund such activities 
year issues the company continues to identify  evaluate and implement modifications to its business systems in order to achieve year date conversion compliance 
the company s business systems are comprised of third party vendor systems and certain internally developed systems that vary greatly in size  complexity and technical architecture 
as a part of the company s ongoing business plan  the company continues to install new applications and upgrade existing ones in order to bring applications for its various locations into compliance 
the majority of information technology systems readiness efforts and critical systems testing are scheduled to be completed by the middle of the remaining systems are to be completed by the fourth quarter of the company is in the process of receiving responses from third party software vendors 
preliminary indications are that they will be year ready and will provide updated software on a timely basis 
the majority of the non information technology non it systems are scheduled to be inventoried by the second quarter of all non it systems are scheduled to be ready by the end of the third quarter of  with minor exceptions 
normal maintenance schedules for the fourth quarter of will allow the company to complete any final readiness efforts 
contacts are currently being made with all critical third parties  such as governmental agencies  financial institutions  suppliers and vendors  to determine if they will be year compliant 
an aggressive follow up will be implemented with those third parties not responding or those returning an unacceptable response 
if it is determined that there is a significant risk  an effort will be made to work with this third party 
if this is not successful  a new provider of the same services will be found 
the company still has not yet determined the complete status of year compliance of its third parties or what additional costs  if any  might be required by the company 
the company is currently implementing a broad information systems upgrade 
the estimated costs associated with upgrading hardware and software associated with year readiness are approximately million and include efforts which were accelerated due to year compliance 
total costs incurred as of december   for year readiness have not been material 
as year impact assessment nears completion and the renovation planning  readiness implementation and testing evolve  the estimated costs may change 
the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios would be the inability of third party suppliers  such as utility providers  telecommunication companies  and other critical suppliers  such as food service suppliers and health care suppliers  to continue providing their products and services or the inability of the company s contracting governmental agencies to timely pay the company for its services 
these pose the most material operational  safety and or financial risks to the company 
in addition  the company may not obtain accurate and timely year date impact information from suppliers of automation and process control systems and processes 
without quality information from suppliers  specifically on embedded chip technology  some year problems could go undetected until after january  the company has localized contingency plans already in place and is currently working to develop a corporate wide contingency plan format 
this format includes a template and other guidelines to help develop a plan that will cover the year areas of concern 
these plans are to be completed and tested  when practicable  by the fourth quarter of the foregoing year discussion includes forward looking statements of the company s efforts and management s expectations relating to year readiness 
the company s ability to achieve year readiness  and the level of costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to install or modify proprietary hardware and software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing year readiness review 
new accounting standard in april  statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop was issued 
sop requires entities to expense start up costs as incurred and to expense previously capitalized start up costs as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the year adopted 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at december   the company s unamortized start up costs were approximately million 
in january  the company adopted sop and recorded a net of tax charge of approximately million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
inflation management of the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations during the past three years 
however  most of the company s facility management contracts provide for payments to the company of either fixed per diem fees or per diem fees that increase by only small amounts during the terms of the contracts 
inflation could substantially increase the company s personnel costs the largest component of facility management expense or other operating expenses at rates faster than any increases in occupancy fees
