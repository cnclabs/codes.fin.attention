the company maintains a revolving line of credit with a uk bank 
this line of credit provides for borrowings of up to l million million and bore interest at per annum on utilized amounts at january  at january   million was outstanding under this facility 
management expects to be able to retain this facility for the foreseeable future  although no assurances can be given

the company believes that the cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under its credit facilities will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in addition  if the company deems it financially attractive  the company may seek to raise additional funds through increased bank borrowings or through the sale of its equity securities 
to the extent the company raises additional capital through the sale of its equity securities  ownership dilution to the company s stockholders will result 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect upon the company s results of operations to date 
in the event the rate of inflation should accelerate in the future  it is expected that costs in connection with the provision by the company of its services and products will increase  and  to the extent such increased costs are not offset by increased revenues  the operations of the company may be adversely affected 
capitalized software development costs during fiscal the company developed certain proprietary software products  shortlands  pharoah and contender 
the developments included enhancing product functionality to incorporate graphical user interfaces gui and web enabling these products 
the work was carried out during fiscal in accordance with the company s accounting policy on software development costs 
a total of  has been capitalized 
at january   of this has been amortized leaving a total net capitalized amount of  year the year issue stems from the use of a two digit date to represent the year in computer software and firmware 
this has meant that many currently installed electronic systems are not capable of distinguishing dates beginning with the year as a result  computer systems and applications may experience operating difficulties unless those systems or applications are modified to correctly process information related to date 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its products  the services it provides to its clients  or its own computer and embedded systems 
in addition  the company is at risk from third parties with which it deals to the extent that they experience failure of their own computer systems or products upon which they rely 
the company s business could be materially adversely affected by the direct cost of dealing with the year issue and further  any costs of defending and resolving any year disputes and any liability to damages  including consequential damage  could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the company recognizes the need to minimize the impact of year issues on its operations 
it has put in place a comprehensive year risk management initiative that it believes is adequately funded  staffed and controlled 
the initiative covers both information technology it systems and non it systems and seeks to address all the year issues affecting the company 
the initiative is ongoing and is planned to continue to include the february  leap year 
it is on schedule and expected to complete the final phase of monitoring checks during july thereafter the focus will switch to re evaluating the position and confirming that all systems remain compliant  and include testing to ensure that no non compliant systems are introduced 
the company has established procedures for evaluating and managing the risks and costs associated with this issue 
funding and execution of this initiative is within the existing business units and operating budgets and is not viewed as material 
based on the current assessment  the company believes that the cost to resolve year issues  other than unanticipated liabilities  should not exceed  in the year to january  the costs incurred to january   were  however  should the company encounter significant unforeseen year problems  either in it s products or internal business systems or in relation to third party vendors  manufacturers or suppliers  actual costs could materially exceed this budget 
in addition the company may acquire businesses or assets which contain systems which are themselves subject to year issues 
as part of the acquisition process  the company employs a comprehensive due diligence checklist which is designed  among other matters  to identify such exposures 
any identified exposure is then subject to inclusion in the company s year initiative and the cost is included as part of the acquisition budget 
as a key part of the year initiative the company has and will continue to upgrade  replace and test components in its networks  it systems and non it systems 
the company believes that it has allocated adequate resources for this purpose and it expects that the final phase of its year initiative will complete on schedule by july however should it for any reason fail to do so  year problems could have an adverse material impact the company s operations 
the company has incomplete information concerning the year compliance status of its customers 
if for any reason their own preparedness is insufficient  this could adversely affect the company s ability to supply them with products and services as part of its ongoing business 
the company is also in the process of contacting it s critical suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors to determine that their operations and the products and services  that they provide are year compliant 
where practicable  the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of third parties to be year  ready including developing contingency plans 
however  such failures  including any failures of any contingency plan  remains a possibility and could have a material adverse impact upon the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company has established a business continuity plan to deal with normal day to day failures 
this is being extended to encompass  where possible  difficulties arising from date related issues 
the year contingency plan incorporates all the resilience utilized in the established business continuity plan and in the worst case scenario realizes the possibility of operation without computer equipment 
the contingency plan in the event of failure of non it technology  where this affects building access  will involve disabling such equipment to allow occupation 
however  external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as interruption of service from utilities or disruption of transportation  may exceed the scope of the company s contingency planning 
introduction of single european currency euro on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
based on its preliminary assessment  the company does not believe the conversion will have a material impact on the competitiveness of its service offerings in europe  as substantial price transparency already exists 
the company expects that modifications to comply with euro requirements have been and will continue to be made to its business operations and systems on a timely basis and does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to continue to complete such modifications on a timely basis  any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the company faces risks to the extent that suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors upon whom the company relies and their suppliers  are unable to make appropriate modifications to support euro transactions 
the inability of such third parties to support euro transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the company conducts business on a pan european basis through subsidiaries in various countries utilizing major international currencies 
the company is  therefore  exposed to movement in currency exchange rates 
the company continues to maintain a program  which monitors exchange rate fluctuations  and will utilize forward foreign exchange contracts  designed to hedge currency exposures related to certain non functional assets and liabilities resulting from inter company balances when deemed necessary 
by written policy  the company generally does not enter into any type of foreign exchange contract for speculative purposes 
the company has not entered into any type of foreign exchange contract during fiscal
