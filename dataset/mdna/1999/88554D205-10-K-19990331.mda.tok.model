year compliance 
computer based systems that require date time calculations to operate correctly are subject to miscalculations and system failures on and after the year this is known as the yk problem 
the yk problem affects systems that were developed to accept two digit entries for the year in the date code field 
after midnight on december   these systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year another known issue is that many systems will not recognize the year as a leap year 
the yk problem is pervasive in that it goes beyond internal systems to involve supply and distribution chains and extends to both public and private infrastructure services including water  gas  electricity  transportation and communications 
the company believes its current products are year compliant 
in addition  the company has been evaluating all products sold since inception for year readiness  and is providing the results of the analysis and potential impacts and resolutions to its customers 
current information on the company s yk status can be found on the internet at http www 
dsystems 
com 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the evaluation of substantially all its products 
the necessary upgrade pathways to its customers will be completed by the end of the first quarter of the company plans to have the actual software patches that may be required available for customers by the third quarter the company believes that all products will meet basic functionality requirements  however  since all specific customer situations and uses cannot be anticipated  d systems may see an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
for these reasons  the impact of customer claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company is continuing the comprehensive evaluation of its internal business systems 
certain critical infrastructure and information systems are being upgraded to meet year requirements 
these upgrades will also have the benefit of meeting the euro currency requirements and expanding the capability of the company 
at the completion of these current projects  the company will be conducting transaction testing to evaluate compliance of the overall system infrastructure 
to date  the company has substantially completed the risk analysis on all us based systems 
during the fourth quarter  the company has completed substantially all infrastructure upgrades in the us as well as certain european operations 
the company plans to complete the risk analysis of foreign operations in the first quarter of  as well as implement the year compliance upgrade of its core erp system 
the company believes that the vast majority of yk related issues with respect to internal business systems will be inventoried  analyzed  and resolved by the third quarter  and that certification and or testing will be completed by the end of the third quarter since the majority of the efforts related to year compliance are being performed by internal resources  and are part of an overall plan to upgrade the overall capability of the company and meet euro currency requirements  there is no exact program budget or cost associated exclusively with year efforts 
the company believes costs related to year compliance are less than  and estimates that costs for the worldwide program will not exceed million 
as stated in the liquidity and capital resources section  the company believes that funds generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy year compliance costs 
d systems is continuing to review its critical suppliers to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
the company has completed a survey of key suppliers and evaluated their individual risk potential as well as the risk potential of their suppliers 
in addition  the company has conducted site surveys of certain critical or sole source suppliers 
the company will begin evaluating next tier suppliers in the first quarter currently  the company s contingency strategies include seeking alternative sources of supplies or acquiring sufficient material to support the company s operations for the first half of though the company believes it has sufficient alternatives and liquidity to meet this contingency strategy  such failures of suppliers remain a possibility and could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
year compliance is an issue for virtually all businesses  whose computer systems and applications may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications 
companies owning and operating such systems may plan to devote a substantial portion of their capital spending to fund such upgrades and modifications and divert spending away from capital manufacturing equipment spending 
such changes in customers spending patterns could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales  operating results or financial condition
