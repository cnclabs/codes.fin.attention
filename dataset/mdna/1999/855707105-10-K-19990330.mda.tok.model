in discussing results of operations  state auto p c  national  mutual  milbank and midwest security are referred to collectively as the state auto insurance companies  while state auto p c  mutual  milbank and midwest security are referred to as the pooled companies 
results of operations net income for the company decreased in increased in 
the company s statutory combined ratios for  and  respectively  were  and 
impacting the company s results for and was an increase in the level of catastrophe losses for these periods  being the worst catastrophe year in the company s history and being the second worst 
consolidated earned premiums increased in in 
this increase was derived from three sources 
the impact of the change in allocation percentages of the company s pooling percentages as well as the addition of midwest security to the pool increased consolidated earned premiums 
the growth in the standard insurance segment  excluding the impact of the changes in the pooling arrangement  increased consolidated earned premiums in 
the company s nonstandard insurance segment ie  national increased consolidated earned premiums from the previous period in state auto p c and milbank  which represents state auto financial s standard insurance segment  achieved a increase in earned premiums in both personal and commercial lines in in 
of the increase  was due to the change in the pooling arrangement and in was due to external growth 
with respect to personal lines  in both and  the pooled companies produced an increase of approximately in its direct written premiums despite a significant increase in aggressive price competition in this book of business 
contributing favorably to the personal lines business over the last few years has been the company s prime of life program the program  that targets insureds and older  that was first introduced by the company in late the program  which has consistently generated of the company s new business  has also exhibited a significantly higher than average retention rate 
the continued growth of the program is gradually changing the profile of the company s personal lines book of business as more and more baby boomers age into eligibility 
page the commercial lines direct written premium of the pooled companies increased in approximately in 
the rate of growth on the company s commercial lines has slowed in recent years due primarily to a reduction in premiums in the company s workers compensation line of business which is due to rate reductions resulting from decreases in loss costs as promulgated by various rating bureaus 
this phenomena  that began in late  continued into the workers compensation line of business represents approximately of the pooled companies commercial business at the end of the nonstandard segment national increased its earned premiums in in 
this segment s growth has slowed compared to prior year levels due to aggressive underwriting action designed to improve profitability in tennessee and arkansas  national s two largest states  a more restrictive underwriting posture with several larger producers in its other states  and rate increases implemented during in several operating states 
while these actions have resulted in a decrease in growth over prior year levels  national s statutory loss experience has improved over comparative prior periods 
see discussion below 
national began operations in four new states during indiana  pennsylvania  utah and wisconsin 
contributing to national s increase in premiums in was entry into arkansas and georgia in december  minnesota in february and in the later half of  alabama  illinois and missouri 
in  national has planned entry into at least three new states south carolina  south dakota and maryland 
in premium growth was harder to achieve than it has been in some time 
while commercial lines pricing continued to be very aggressive  the personal lines part of our business is also seeing intense price competition  with increased marketing activity among major players in personal lines auto insurance 
this adversely affected the pooled companies ability to generate new business because management has continued to stress responsible pricing and diligent underwriting in contrast to much of its competition 
at least annually  the state auto insurance companies reviews each line of business to ensure that it is appropriately priced 
as a result  much of the premium growth noted above within the standard insurance segment was attributable to the state auto insurance companies ability to put into place price increases on the existing book of business as opposed to the sale of new units 
the company has attempted to address the difficulties of securing growth by making selective acquisitions which afford opportunities for increased writings in new  desirable states of operation 
within the last eight years  entry into new states  other than oklahoma  has been by acquisition 
in mutual acquired milbank which took the state auto insurance companies into south and north dakota  minnesota and utah 
in mutual acquired midwest security  thus entering wisconsin 
in  state auto financial acquired farmers casualty and mid plains taking the state auto insurance companies into iowa and kansas 
though all of these acquisitions have been primarily personal lines companies  they have taken the company into additional targeted states with an established independent agency force with an existing book of business on which to build 
management believes this reduces start up costs and permits faster growth in new states than has been the case with starting in a new state from scratch 
with an established agency force  the company has a ready made distribution force for offering an expanded product portfolio  including commercial lines and additional personal lines products 
net investment income increased in in 
contributing to the increase over previous years was an increase in cash flow from operations and a general increase in investable assets over the previous year s levels 
total cost of investable assets at december   and  respectively  was million  million and million 
additionally  in state auto p c and milbank received approximately million in conjunction with the change in the pooling arrangement 
the investment yields  based on fixed and equity securities at cost  were  and for the annual periods ending  and  respectively 
contributing to the decrease in the investment yields over these periods has been a decline in the overall market fixed maturity interest rate environment from the previous comparable periods as well as a gradual shift in the composition of the fixed maturity portfolio from taxable to tax exempt fixed maturities 
at december   and  respectively  tax exempt securities comprised approximately   and of the fixed maturity portfolio 
somewhat lower yields are expected in on the fixed maturity portfolio given that a number of high yield fixed maturities are being called or maturing and are being reinvested at current page lower yielding rates 
despite these lower yielding rates  the company has no intention of compromising the quality of its portfolio for higher yielding  more risky investments 
additionally  the company began a program in late to build on the equity portfolio to enhance growth of statutory surplus over the long term  which continued in see further discussion regarding investments at the investments market risk section included herein 
in february  president clinton proposed the fiscal year budget 
one of the more significant revenue raising proposals contained in the budget directly affects property and casualty insurance companies 
property and casualty insurance companies are currently limited on the deductibility of the investment income earned on tax exempt fixed maturities and certain dividends received to 
this reduction was the result of the tax act of president clinton  in his february proposal  has proposed a further limitation of ie  deductibility of investment income earned from tax exempt fixed maturities and certain dividends received would be limited to 
the current proposal would be effective for taxable years beginning after the date of enactment  with respect to investments acquired on or after the date of first committee action 
president clinton had proposed a similar action for the fiscal year budget limiting the deductibility of investment income earned on tax exempt fixed maturities and certain dividends received to 
the municipalities lobbied very hard against such action as property and casualty insurance companies and other financial service industries are the largest investors in municipalities fixed maturities 
if this revenue raising proposal passes as it currently stands  certain tax exempt securities would become less appealing to the property and casualty insurance industry as the relative spread between after tax yields on tax exempt and taxable fixed income maturities will narrow 
this management will be monitoring the government s actions regarding this proposal 
however  it is still too early in the budget process to anticipate the outcome 
management services income  which includes income generated from the investment management services segment and executive management services provided by stateco and state auto p c  respectively  increased million in both and other income includes primarily revenue from sis sales of its software products  and beginning in rental income on property leased by pml 
in  other income increased in 
pml s commencement of leasing operations in increased other income while sis increase in software sales over contributed a increase 
in  other income was comprised mainly of sis software sales which increased from same period in losses and loss expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums  were  and for years  and  respectively 
as previously discussed  the company experienced increased levels in storm related catastrophe losses in and  primarily in the standard insurance segment 
the second quarter was impacted by storm related catastrophe losses occurring in nearly all operating states and the third quarter was adversely affected by several midwestern wind and hail storms 
the impact of the catastrophe losses amounted to gaap loss ratio points whereas catastrophe losses totaled gaap loss ratio points 
despite the higher level of catastrophe losses as compared to  the company did not experience any significant loss activity from hurricanes bonnie  earl and georges 
in the company was impacted by severe winter weather and storm losses in raleigh  north carolina resulting from hurricane fran moving inland 
the impact of the catastrophe claims amounted to gaap loss ratio points 
the relatively low level of hurricane losses within the last three years validates the company s strategy of closely monitoring concentration of risks subject to coastal losses 
absent the increased level of catastrophes  the company s underlying book remained strong and in fact  reflects improvement from prior years  validating the company s philosophy of responsible underwriting versus emphasis on premium growth achieved with irresponsible pricing or risk selection 
losses and loss expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums  for the nonstandard insurance segment  were  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
increase in the ratio was due to underwriting problems that occurred in two of the segment s larger states of operations as previously discussed 
in early  national implemented rate increases in these two states and took a more aggressive underwriting posture with several of its larger agencies in an effort to control the underwriting losses this segment was beginning to experience 
page in an effort to reduce its exposures to any one type of catastrophic loss  the company  in recent years  has sought to geographically diversify into regions of the country not exposed to earthquakes and hurricanes 
as previously discussed  this has been accomplished through the acquisitions of milbank  midwest security  farmers casualty and mid plains 
while some states are not subject to the threats of hurricanes or earthquakes  virtually all have some windstorm and or hail exposure 
along with the increasing geographic dispersion of the company s underwriting risk portfolio  the company continues to refine its methods of monitoring its exposures to all types of catastrophe hazards 
acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the expense ratio  were  and for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the expense ratio in can be attributed to a reduced amount of quality performance bonus the bonus paid to employees compared to that paid in  but this was partially offset by an increase in guaranty fund assessments 
the increase in the expense ratio from that in is due to the amortization of software expenses  the bonus and the amount of bonus compensation earned by the company s agents 
beginning with the first quarter of  the state auto insurance companies began amortizing costs associated with the development of its claims and billing processing system that began a little over two years ago 
the amortization period of these costs will be approximately three years 
the bonus in exceeded that which was earned in due to an improvement in the underwriting operations of the company in also contributing to this increase was an increase over of the amount of bonus compensation earned by the company s agents 
each agent who meets certain premium production thresholds shares in the underwriting profits generated by insurance placed by them 
in an attempt to improve the efficiency of its operations and thereby reduce overall operating expenditures in the long term  the company has been making strides in the use of technology to streamline its personal and commercial operations  specifically in the area of electronic upload and download with its agencies using the apt industry standard 
the advent of electronic transfers between the agent and the company should have a long term positive impact on the company s expenses as the company has been able to reduce its paper and postage costs as well as stabilize its employee count which should continue as this process expands to more agencies and lines of business 
additionally  it should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of both the agent and the company through quicker response time and increased accuracy 
in addition to the use of technology  the company is realigning its claims procedures in order to improve service and reduce settlement expenses 
the company extensively trains its claims adjusters  whose professionalism is exhibited by the low number of complaints received by the various state insurance regulators 
while the company trains each adjuster to handle all types of claims  the company recognizes that many claims are small and routine in nature 
rather than have a thoroughly trained adjuster spend time on these claims  the company has established a central claims department staffed by persons who focus exclusively on these losses 
this allows for quicker response time to the insured  allows the fully trained claims adjuster to focus on the more serious claims  and reduces the use of independent adjusters 
other expense includes those operating expenses associated with general corporate expenses  sis  pml and stateco s investment management services the investment management services segment 
in other expense increased decrease in 
sis operating expenses increased over contributing an increase of to other expense 
also contributing to this increase was an increase in write offs of premium receivable during  primarily in the nonstandard insurance segment 
this segment has sought to improve its premium receivable collections by retaining the services of a third party whose business is receivables collection 
additionally  there was a general increase in corporate expenses over the decrease in other expenses in is primarily due to the state auto insurance companies changing the catastrophe portion of its reinsurance program beginning july   that prior to this period was accounted for as deposit reinsurance see liquidity and capital resources 
expenses associated with the catastrophe portion of the program accounted for as deposit reinsurance were included in other expense 
page the effective federal tax rate was  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the lower rates in and were due to a decrease in the underwriting profit compared to the period as a result of the increased storm related catastrophes experienced by the company during these periods as well as a shift in the composition of its investment portfolio from taxables to tax exempts  as previously noted 
the increased rate in was due to an increase in underwriting profit recorded for the year and higher realized capital gains 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for both long and short term cash obligations as they come due 
the company s significant sources of cash are premiums  investment income and investments as they mature 
the company continually monitors its investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated and unanticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
in  net cash provided by operating activities increased to million million in 
this increase is due to the transfer of million to state auto p c and milbank in connection with the amended pooling arrangement  as discussed above  as well as a general increase in cash flows that resulted from a change in pool percentages from previous periods 
in  net cash provided by operating activities increased to million million in 
this increase in cash flow was due to an overall improvement in the insurance operations of the company  attributable to lower catastrophe losses from the previous year 
over the last three years  operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet the operating needs of the company while providing opportunities for increased investment and financing needs 
management does not anticipate any significant changes in its operating cash flow 
net cash used in investing activities reflects cash flows used in purchases of fixed maturities and equity securities  respectively  of million and million in  million and million in and million and million in the decline in the purchase of fixed maturities in was a matter of timing  as funds invested in cash equivalents at december  were allocated for investment in early as market interest rates on fixed maturities began to decline over the last three years  the company began experiencing a steady increase in the amount of calls on fixed maturities 
cash flows provided by maturities  calls and principal reductions of fixed maturities were million in  million in and million in during pml began construction of a building in goodlettsville  tennessee that will be leased to mutual and its affiliates in it is anticipated that the total construction costs of this building  excluding land will be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities consists of proceeds from issuance of common stock that has exceeded the payment of dividends for the last three years 
mutual  whose ownership in state auto financial has increased from to almost in  has waived its right to receipt of the dividends declared by state auto financial in an effort to enhance the statutory surplus of the insurance subsidiaries of state auto financial for use in support of underwriting operations 
additionally  waivers of dividends by mutual enhance the company s financial position which benefits mutual  the company s largest shareholder  and other shareholders as well 
each dividend waiver is reviewed by mutual s board of directors 
effective july   the state auto insurance companies negotiated a change in their catastrophe reinsurance program 
the amount retained by the state auto insurance companies is million for each occurrence  an increase of million over the prior program 
for up to million in losses  excess of million  traditional reinsurance coverage is provided

state auto p c will use the contributed capital to pay its direct catastrophe losses and losses assumed under the catastrophe reinsurance agreement 
state auto financial is obligated to repay spc which will repay the lenders by redeeming the preferred shares over a six year period 
this layer of million in excess of million has been excluded from the pooling agreement 
in addition  state auto financial s obligation to repay spc has been secured by a put agreement among state auto financial  mutual and the lenders  under which  in the event of a default by state auto financial as described in the credit agreement or in the put agreement  mutual would be obligated to put either the preferred shares or the loan s outstanding 
on march   mutual acquired of the outstanding shares of midwest security  effective as of january  in connection with this purchase  mutual and state auto financial entered into an option agreement granting state auto financial the right to purchase midwest security from mutual within five years at a price determined by a formula set out in the option agreement 
as of march   state auto financial has not exercised its right to acquire midwest security

the company is required to notify the insurance subsidiaries respective state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary commissioner of each insurer subsidiary has the authority to limit a non extraordinary dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations

as a result of this inventory  it identified approximately million lines of in house maintained program code in its various software systems 
following this inventory the company set priorities as to system remediation based on the role each system played in the company s being able to carry on its insurance operations or meet its general business needs 
the company s applications software must support certain essential functions issuing insurance policies  collecting policy premiums and paying claims and premium refunds 
in addition  there is other applications software used by the company in the general operation and management of its business 
following months of intensive remediation effort  in april  the company conducted its first major test of one of its major insurance policy processing systems 
the results of that test were positive 
the company conducted a second comprehensive millennium test at an off site computer facility in august all major insurance policy processing systems were tested as if it were the year testing also included leap day  february  this test was also successful 
in  two additional tests are planned for march and september 
additionally  all internal test systems run with advanced dates giving the company the opportunity to identify yk issues early enough to react to them 
at this time  one hundred percent of the company s in force insurance policies are being processed on a yk compliant system  based on the test results mentioned above 
however  in an effort to ensure that no material problems arise from the policy processing systems used by the company and its affiliates or subsidiaries all of which are sometimes collectively referred to hereafter as state auto the company plans to continue simulated year testing throughout state auto s yk project team has  through february  completed its efforts on approximately of state auto s applications software 
that means that approximately of the software systems state auto uses in its insurance operations or in meeting its general business needs has been through yk remediation  testing  and has been introduced back into the company s production environment 
included within this are the systems that address policy issuance  premium billing and collection and claims processing at state auto 
the remaining of applications software code that is not presently yk compliant involves applications that are not mission critical  such as certain management reports and other similar tools 
some of this remaining code may well be determined to be obsolete 
state auto plans to have of its non obsolete applications software yk compliant by mid year in addition to addressing its own applications software yk problems  state auto may be affected by the yk issues of third parties with which it has a material relationship 
this includes the independent insurance agents who sell the company s products  many of whom have automated agency management systems in place 
in addition  a number of state auto agencies and the company are able to communicate policy data electronically 
there are several agency management systems that permit this so called upload and download of information but not all are yk compliant 
if upload and download are disrupted by yk issues  it will likely affect the efficiency with which the company operates its business 
page the company has surveyed all state auto agencies that currently upload data electronically to state auto and verified that every one of these agencies has a yk compliant agency vendor system 
for those agencies that only receive a download of policy information from state auto  current information on the yk compliance status of their systems available to state auto indicates that the majority of them are yk compliant 
in the event that any of these agencies encounters any difficulty with download  state auto is prepared to suspend the electronic transfer and turn back on the generation of policy documents of which an agency would need to maintain records manually 
the consequences of the disruption would depend on the extent to which state auto s various lines of business may be uploaded and downloaded at the time the disruption would occur and the duration of the disruption 
thus  it is not possible to reasonably estimate the financial impact of such reduced efficiency 
there are certain other vendors which have a material relationship with the company by virtue of the fact that they provide a product or service that state auto uses in the ordinary course of its business  such as underwriting information providers  task specific software or hardware product vendors  and financial institutions 
yk compliance by third party vendors will continue to be one of state auto s focal points throughout the remainder of state auto expects to have third party vendor products then in use yk compliant by the end of the rd quarter of stateco financial services  inc stateco  a wholly owned subsidiary of state auto financial which provides investment management services to each of the state auto insurers  has had in place a third party vendor investment management system which is represented by the vendor to be yk compliant 
based on its present use of this system  stateco does not expect its services to be disrupted by yk issues affecting it  although stateco will be included in the contingency planning discussed below should some unanticipated system failure arise 
state auto financial s costs to address year issues state auto financial s yk compliance expense to date for resources has been million dollars of a projected million dollars 
this estimate is subject to change depending on future  presently unforeseen developments which could affect the cost of yk compliance for state auto 
the money spent to date is virtually all payroll costs attributable to the state auto employees on the yk project team 
the foregoing expense does not include approximately million spent by state auto financial on accelerated technology purchases for systems or equipment to ensure yk compliance for such system or equipment 
also  an outsourcing agreement with state auto s primary third party software vendor to provide additional resources for other systems projects has generated an additional expense to state auto financial of approximately million over the last two years 
state auto s risks due to year issues as a property casualty insurer  state auto faces the additional risk of insured or allegedly insured losses to its policyholders from the yk exposure 
state auto has clarified certain commercial liability insurance policies with respect to this exposure 
it is too early to know the nature and extent of insured losses that might arise from the yk problem  be they from information systems failures or embedded chip processing failures 
state auto does not expect a material adverse impact from yk issues arising from embedded chip processing failures occurring on site 
those embedded chip issues which the company has some opportunity to control or address that have been identified to date have been generally facilities related or involving small business equipment ie fax machines 
upgrades and equipment replacement are being coordinated by a variety of business managers responsible for such equipment 
state auto s year contingency plans state auto has not yet created a formal yk contingency plan 
discussions and communications have begun in regards to this 
each internal department has responded to a survey relating to its use of external systems which might be subject to disruption 
state auto has also had one meeting with a page consultant regarding contingency planning 
the company expects to have a contingency plan in place by the th quarter some of the issues that the plan would likely contemplate would be manual processing alternatives  non electronic forms of information distribution  assurance of adequate supplies  and mitigation of the impact of utilities and financial institution disruptions 
state auto continues to work with its business recovery service provider 
state auto is following a program developed by that provider that requires a comprehensive yk preparation approach 
conforming to this allows state auto to take advantage of its provider s facilities for business recovery in the event that an external yk issue that was addressed does happen to fail 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
