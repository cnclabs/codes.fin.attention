under these provisions  the shareholders of the company included their pro rata share of income or loss in their individual returns

seasonality and quarterly results due to the importance of the fall selling season  which includes halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  the fourth calendar quarter has historically contributed  and is expected to continue to contribute  a substantial majority of the company s profitability for the entire year 
as a result  any factors negatively affecting the company during the fourth quarter of any year  including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions  would have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the entire year 
the company s quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons  the number and timing of new superstore openings  the amount of superstore pre opening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing superstores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  competitive factors  weather and general economic conditions

liquidity and capital resources the company s cash needs are primarily for working capital to support its inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new superstores 
prior to the sale of common shares in october  the company had financed its operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  borrowing under bank financing agreements and subordinated loans from its shareholders 
in october the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock  including shares issued upon exercise of an underwriters overallotment option in november net proceeds to the company  after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts and expenses  was million 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to retire long term debt  borrowings under the line of credit and the loans from shareholders 
at december  and the company s working capital was million and million  respectively 
during  cash of million was used in operations  in cash of million was generated by operations 
in and  million and million of cash  respectively  was used to increase inventory levels to support both new and existing stores 
in these periods  part of the inventory increase was financed through increases in accounts payable of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during and was million and million  respectively 
this use of cash was primarily the result of new store openings 
in  the company invested million of proceeds from the sale of shares into marketable securities 
in  the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  which includes approximately million for new store openings  million for remodeling and systems in existing stores  and the remainder for warehouse equipment and systems development 
on march  the company entered into a new four year financing agreement with a bank which provides a million revolving credit facility  million of which is available immediately with the remainder available in million increments in and providing the company is in compliance with the agreement s covenants 
in the company utilized a portion of the credit facility to finance the acquisition of various equipment purchases through a series of five year capital leases 
the company believes the proceeds from the public offering  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under the financing agreement will be sufficient to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations during the past three years 
year the company s computer systems operate on a pc based local area network lan 
each superstore has personal computers linked to the main office lan by modem 
management has evaluated the issues relating to the year yk as it may affect a the company s operating and financial systems and other systems such as its telephone system  and b future operating results  and has determined that in most instances  the company s systems are compliant with year requirements 
in those instances where hardware or software is not compliant  the company has determined a course of action which should be complete by the end of the second quarter of the company has determined the cost of addressing the yk issue is immaterial and the changes required in the company s systems to become yk compliant are of a magnitude which is unlikely to impact future operating performance 
the company does not separately track internal direct costs associated with the utilization of its officers and employees in its year readiness efforts 
the company has surveyed all of its significant vendors and has ascertained that in most cases those vendors are already in compliance or have plans to be compliant by the middle of in evaluating the risks to the company  the most serious risk would be if a vendor does not become compliant with the yk requirements and  as a result  is unable to ship needed inventory to the company 
should this occur  the company does have the ability to resource product from other vendors 
the company is in the intermediate stage of developing contingency plans to mitigate the potential disruptions that may result from the yk issue 
these plans may include identifying and securing alternate suppliers  stockpiling of select products and other measures considered appropriate by management 
the company expects to complete these plans by the middle of once developed and approved  contingency plans  and the related cost estimates  if any  will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
despite the company s efforts to make its systems and facilities year compliant  the ability of third party service providers  vendors and certain other third parties  including governmental entities and utility companies  to be year compliant is beyond the company s control 
accordingly  the company can give no assurances that the systems of other parties on which the company s systems or operations rely will be timely converted or compatible with the company s systems 
the failure of these entities to comply on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on the company
