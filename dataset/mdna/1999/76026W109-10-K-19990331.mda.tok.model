this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
general reptron has grown rapidly through the implementation of its strategy of integrating value added distribution services with contract manufacturing 
since the acquisition of k byte manufacturing in  and other subsequent acquisitions  reptron s net sales have increased from approximately million to approximately million in reptron has also focused on improving its operating margin through such measures as i shifting reptron distribution s business mix from standard component sales to higher margin value added services  which now represent of its net sales  ii continuing to increase the number of customers using both of reptron s distribution and contract manufacturing services  thereby lowering overall selling expenses  iii investing in facilities technology in order to improve efficiencies  and iv creating a corporate sales operation to more efficiently access smaller volume customers 
k byte manufacturing offers contract manufacturing services to its customers on a turnkey basis pursuant to customer designs 
under turnkey arrangements  and pursuant to the customers design  schematics and bill of materials k byte manufacturing purchases the electronic components and other materials used in assembly and delivers a completed product 
for strategic reasons  k byte manufacturing does not pursue consignment business in which the customer supplies the product material and pays only for labor and manufacturing costs 
reptron believes that by retaining total responsibility for material procurement it can achieve greater control of the manufacturing process and leverage the strengths of reptron distribution 
the marketing cycle for k byte manufacturing engagements tends to span six to twelve months and the start up phase typically spans another six months 
during start up  significant investments are made by k byte manufacturing and its customers to prepare for the successful launch of the contract manufacturing engagement 
k byte manufacturing s contracts with customers address the customers obligations relative to cancellation  inventory risks  component price increases  engineering change notices  inventory stores  work in process and vendor stock and payment terms 
in  reptron acquired the electronic components distribution businesses of two distributors collectively  the acquisitions 
the acquisitions  which were accounted for using the purchase method  involved a total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and the balance in assumed liabilities 
in december  reptron also created a division devoted solely to selling memory modules 
this division sells memory modules primarily to computer integrators  retail stores and value added resellers  a customer base not historically served by reptron distribution 
sales in this market segment are generally characterized by lower gross margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses than other sales generated by reptron distribution 
sales from this division have consistently increased and accounted for million or and million or of reptron distribution s net sales in and  respectively and of reptron s total net sales in and  respectively 
in pursuant to a stock transaction  reptron acquired all of the assets and liabilities of hibbing 
the transaction was valued at approximately million consisting of the sum of a cash payment of approximately million and the remainder in the form of assumption of liabilities 
the purchase was recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
also in  reptron incurred expenses of approximately million in connection with a proposed business combination with all american semiconductor  which ultimately did not come to fruition 
sales for reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing are recognized upon shipment  except for sales from in plant stores 
sales from in plant stores are recognized when a customer removes a product from reptron s in plant inventory 
sales from in plant stores represented and of reptron distribution s and net sales  respectively and of reptron s total net sales in and  respectively 
in plant inventories are tracked using bar code labeling technology or frequent inventory counts 
cost of sales for reptron distribution includes only the cost of materials electronic components 
cost of sales for k byte manufacturing includes the cost of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing operate as independent businesses 
the needs of reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing differ and management believes that a focused organizational structure is beneficial 
this decentralized organizational structure allows each division to focus on all aspects of their business operations and the critical factors required to be successful within a very competitive marketplace 
reptron s senior management  treasury and finance and legal functions are centralized to ensure a consistent level of corporate strategy and appropriate oversight 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of the company s net sales represented by each line item presented  except for reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing gross profit  which is presented as a percentage of net sales of the respective segments year ended december  net sales  reptron distribution net sales  k byte manufacturing total net sales gross profit  reptron distribution gross profit  k byte manufacturing total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income loss interest expense  net earnings loss before income taxes net earnings loss compared to net sales 
total net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in reptron distribution net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was  in part  attributed to an million decrease in sales to a single customer from million in to million in additionally  severe price erosion  primarily due to abundant supply of many types of electronic components sold by reptron distribution  had a negative effect on net sales 
the largest reptron distribution customer accounted for approximately and of reptron distribution net sales and and of total company net sales in and  respectively 
the highest volume sales office accounted for and of reptron distribution net sales in and  respectively 
sales of semiconductors  passive components and electromechanical components accounted for  and  respectively  of reptron distribution net sales 
reptron distribution s net sales were comprised of semiconductors  passive components and electromechanical components 
representation by reptron distribution of its major vendor lines remained relatively stable with sales from the top four vendors accounting for approximately million  or of reptron distribution net sales  as compared with approximately million  or of reptron distribution net sales 
k byte manufacturing net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in net sales generated by hibbing  acquired on may   were approximately million in new customers accounted for an increase of million in net sales  which was off set by a net decrease in net sales of million  primarily attributable to reductions in customer orders from the previously existing k byte manufacturing customer base 
k byte manufacturing transacted business with approximately customers inclusive of hibbing customers in the three largest customers represented approximately  and  respectively  of the division s net sales  and  respectively  of reptron s total net sales 
sales to customers in the telecommunications industry accounted for approximately of k byte manufacturing net sales  while sales to customers in the healthcare  industrial instrumentation and banking industries accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of k byte manufacturing net sales 
k byte manufacturing s net sales included    and from the industrial instrumentation  healthcare  telecommunications and banking industries  respectively 
the tampa  florida  gaylord  michigan and hibbing  minnesota manufacturing plants accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of k byte manufacturing total net sales 
gross profit 
total gross profit decreased million  or from million in to million in gross margin decreased from in to in reptron distribution gross profit decreased million  or from million in to million in and the gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to an industry wide decrease in average selling prices  sales mix shift to lower margin products and the write down of certain inventory due to the loss of certain vendor lines and the acceleration of industry wide price declines 
k byte manufacturing gross profit decreased million  or from million in to million in gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to the underutilization of fixed costs and overhead at current sales levels  a change in customer demand to a sales mix of lower margin business  the amortization of capitalized costs and the write off of certain capitalized costs and inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or from million in to million in hibbing accounted for approximately million of the increase in the remaining increase was primarily due to investments in sales operations  management information systems  engineers and senior management  the costs associated with the aborted all american semiconductor transaction  the write off of certain bad debts  the costs of consultants used in re engineering the manufacturing process and employee severance costs 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributed to the increase in average outstanding net debt total debt less invested cash reserves of million  or from million during to million during this million increase in average outstanding net debt during is primarily attributed to the decrease in cash as a result of the may  purchase of hibbing 
compared to net sales 
total net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in reptron distribution net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the largest customer of reptron is a customer of both reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing 
this customer accounted for approximately of reptron distribution net sales  of k byte manufacturing net sales and of total company net sales 
the highest volume sales office accounted for of total reptron distribution net sales 
sales of semiconductors  passive components and electromechanical components accounted for  and  respectively  of reptron distribution s net sales 
the percentage of net sales revenue derived from semiconductor sales decreased from in  primarily as a result of the decline in average selling prices for srams and drams 
representation by reptron distribution of its major vendor lines remained relatively stable in  with sales generated from the top four vendors accounting for approximately million  or of reptron distribution s net sales  as compared with approximately million or of reptron distribution s net sales 
k byte manufacturing net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in sales to new customers accounted for approximately million of the increase in net sales in the remainder of the increase in net sales  approximately million  was generated by the previously existing k byte manufacturing customer base 
k byte manufacturing transacted business with approximately customers in with the largest three customers representing approximately  and  respectively  of k byte manufacturing net sales  and of reptron s total net sales 
sales to customers in the industrial instrumentation industry accounted for of k byte manufacturing net sales  while sales to customers in the healthcare industry  telecommunications industry and banking industry accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales in the tampa  florida manufacturing plant accounted for of k byte manufacturing net sales  with the gaylord  michigan plant totaling of net sales and the saline  michigan  short production run plant  accounting for the remaining 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in gross margin decreased from in to in reptron distribution s gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in and the gross margin decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to industry wide semiconductor pricing declines and increased competition 
for example  although memory module division units shipped increased approximately  memory module division net sales increased by only 
k byte manufacturing s gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in the gross margin decreased from in to in during  nine new customers were integrated into the k byte contract manufacturing operation 
in order to meet the demands of this integration process  reptron added significant production staff which resulted in production inefficiencies and declining margins 
these actions were necessary to meet the demand of existing customers as well as the commitments made to the new customers 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in expense is primarily reflective of investments in senior management and field application engineers  as well as  higher variable costs associated with the increase in net sales 
these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in interest expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in in august   reptron issued million of subordinated convertible notes at a coupon rate of 
a portion of the proceeds was used to pay down existing indebtedness under a revolving credit facility 
the remainder of the proceeds has been invested in short term municipal bonds 
the increase in net interest expense is primarily attributed to the net increase in outstanding net debt total debt less cash of million from million as of december  to million as of december  currency fluctuation reptron pays for its purchases from foreign sources  including asian manufacturers  in us dollars  which reduces the adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
reptron has not experienced substantial adverse effects from currency fluctuations to date 
liquidity and capital resources reptron primarily finances its operations through subordinated notes  operating cash flows  bank credit lines  capital equipment leases and short term financing through supplier credit lines 
on january   reptron entered into a million revolving credit agreement credit agreement with pnc bank the lender to replace its existing million revolving credit facility with nationsbank the nationsbank credit facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by all of reptron s inventory  accounts receivable  equipment and general intangibles 
the credit agreement limits the amount of capital expenditures and prohibits the payment of dividends thereby restricting the distribution of the retained earnings of reptron 
reptron may  at its option  and upon notice to the lender  request advance funds pursuant to either a domestic rate loan or a eurodollar rate loan 
upon notice to the lender  reptron may convert advances from one type of loan to the other 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement as of march  were approximately million 
this amount was drawn in conjunction with a reptron subsidiary s purchase from nationsbank of the mortgage note on the buildings located in tampa  florida 
it is contemplated that this mortgage note will be sold to another financial institution during as of december   reptron was in compliance with  or received waivers  on all financial covenants under the nationsbank credit facility 
there were no amounts outstanding under the nationsbank credit facility as of december  reptron has entered into various capital lease transactions with several financial institutions to finance capital expenditures  primarily for the k byte manufacturing operation 
these leases had an aggregate balance of million as of december  the leases bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to and expire at various dates through july  reptron s operating activities generated cash of approximately million in this increase was primarily a result of a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
these items were off set by a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  a decrease in deferred taxes payable of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
the decrease in inventories was experienced primarily as a result of an increase in k byte manufacturing s average inventory turns from times in to times in reptron distribution s average inventory turns decreased from times in to times in reptron s accounts receivable collections averaged days as of december  and days as of december  reptron used cash of approximately million in investing activities in  comprised of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of hibbing and million in purchase of property  plant and equipment 
these uses of cash were off set by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of approximately  payments on long term obligations used approximately million of cash 
stock sales in connection with the exercise of outstanding reptron options provided cash of approximately  in reptron believes that cash generated from operations  available cash reserves and available credit facilities will be sufficient for reptron to meet its capital expenditures and working capital needs for its operations as presently conducted 
reptron s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on a wide range of factors  including the level of business in existing operations  expansion of facilities and possible acquisitions 
in particular  if cash flows from operations and available credit facilities are not sufficient  it will be necessary for reptron to seek additional financing 
while there can be assurance that such financing would be available in amounts and on terms acceptable to reptron  reptron believes that such financing would likely be available on acceptable terms 
year statement the year issue encompasses the required recognition of computer hardware and software systems and computer controlled devices  including equipment  used in reptron s manufacturing and distribution operations to properly acknowledge the change from year to year the failure of any hardware and software systems or equipment to timely and accurately recognize such change could result in partial or complete systems failure 
in the normal course of business  reptron relies on products and services from critical vendors  customers and other third parties whose computer systems must also be year compliant in order for reptron to realize the uninterrupted flow of its business operations 
reptron is actively taking steps to ensure that its systems and equipment will be year compliant  including assessing the scope of work  prioritizing  certifying compliance  and testing compliance 
reptron has identified those systems and equipment in its reptron distribution and k byte manufacturing including hibbing divisions and in its central corporate operations that are considered to be critical to reptron s day to day operations 
approximately to of the systems and equipment utilized in reptron distribution and reptron s central corporate operations were tested for year compliance during november  with such systems and equipment being certified as year compliant as of march  reptron expects to complete the balance of its year compliance testing of these systems and equipment during the middle of k byte manufacturing has received written assurances from its third party software providers that the software used in its manufacturing operations is year compliant 
although k byte manufacturing has not begun validating such third parties year representations  it has conducted preliminary internal tests of certain of its hardware and software systems  and expects to complete such validation and testing during the middle of while reptron is actively seeking assurances of year compliance from each of its key suppliers  customers and other third parties with whom reptron conducts business  this assessment primarily relies upon such third parties representations of year compliance 
a lack of response or inadequate or inaccurate information from such third parties could materially affect reptron s assessment of year readiness 
until these assessments are completed  which is expected to occur during the middle of  reptron cannot predict whether the failure of any such third party to be year compliant will have a material adverse effect on reptron s business 
to date  the costs incurred by reptron to address year issues have been immaterial  and reptron expects that the costs to complete year compliance certification  testing and verification will also be immaterial 
where appropriate  reptron will develop contingency plans in areas it determines that year readiness is insufficient 
however  no assurances can be given that reptron s year efforts are appropriate  adequate or complete 
in addition  reptron is unable to fully determine the effect of a failure of its own systems or those of any third party with whom it conducts business  but any significant failures could have a material adverse effect on reptron s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
see certain considerations year statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk reptron entered into an interest rate swap agreement during the swap agreement effectively converts a portion of reptron s floating interest rate debt to fixed interest rate debt 
notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received relating to such agreements and do not represent an amount of exposure to credit loss 
under the terms of the agreement  reptron is obligated to pay interest on a notional amount to the extent that the fixed rate of  under the interest rate swap agreement  exceeds the libor rate  as measured pursuant to the agreement 
furthermore  reptron will receive interest to the extent that the libor rate exceeds the fixed rate 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap agreement totaled approximately million which will mature in march  interest received  if any  as a result of this agreement is netted against interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
based on average floating rate borrowings outstanding throughout  a basis point change in libor would have caused reptron s interest expense to change by approximately  reptron believes that this amount is not significant to the results of operations
