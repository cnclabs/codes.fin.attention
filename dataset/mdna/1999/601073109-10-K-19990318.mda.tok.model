acquisitions on january   the company completed its cash tender offer for all of the outstanding common shares of tylan general  inc tylan for per share 
tylan became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company on january  the purchase price was million  plus the assumption of tylan s outstanding debt  net of cash  totaling million 
this acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in a write off for purchased research and development of million in the first quarter of on december   the company acquired the net assets of the amicon separation science business of wr grace co 
amicon for a price of million in cash  including transaction costs 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in a write off for purchased research and development of million in the fourth quarter of as this transaction was completed on the last business day of  the accompanying consolidated statement of income excludes all business activity conducted by amicon 
results of operations the company reported a profit of per share for compared to a loss of per share for and a profit of for excluding restructuring charges and unusual items  the company would have reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  and for  and  respectively 
restructuring charges and unusual items in the second quarter of  the company announced a restructuring program to improve the competitive position of the company by streamlining worldwide operations and reducing the overall cost structure 
the restructuring program was initiated to bring operating costs in line with lower revenues resulting from the financial difficulties in asian economies  the strong us dollar and the continuation of the semiconductor industry slump 
key initiatives include discontinue non strategic product lines  rationalize product offerings and consolidate certain manufacturing operations to eliminate duplicate manufacturing processes and improve product line focus 
realign european country organizational structure to focus on operating business units and establish a regional transaction service center 
reduce administrative and management infrastructure costs in asia 
renegotiate marketing  research and vendor contractual agreements 
streamline the supply chain management function and consolidate vendors resulting in cost savings and better customer response 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded an expense associated with these activities of million million after tax including a restructuring charge of million and a million charge against cost of sales for inventory and fixed asset write offs associated with the rationalization of its product offering and elimination of non strategic business lines 
the million restructuring charge included million of employee severance costs  million write down to fair value of real and intangible assets associated with discontinued product lines  million of lease cancellation costs and million of contract termination costs 
during  approximately million of restructuring costs  consisting primarily of severance  were paid and million remains accrued and will be substantially paid in and with the remainder in future years 
the major programs continuing into include the realignment of european operating units  establishment of the european regional transactional center  streamlining the supply chain management function  consolidating certain manufacturing operations and cancellation of leases 
the restructuring initiatives combined with the consolidation of the company s microelectronics plants will result in the elimination of positions worldwide 
notification to employees was completed in  however a small number of these employees will continue in their existing positions through with their related salary costs charged to operations as incurred 
under the terms of the severance agreements  the company expects to pay severance and associated benefits through the early part of when fully implemented the combination of the restructuring programs and the microelectronics consolidation are expected to yield annual savings of million 
the savings will result in reduced wages  facility related costs  depreciation and amortization and will be primarily reflected as reductions in cost of sales 
the savings began in but will not be fully realized until the company also recorded an incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million during the third quarter of in response to adverse changes in demand attributable to declining business conditions in asia and the slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
see the discussion of gross margins  gain on sale of equity securities  net loss on disposal of discontinued operations and legal proceedings below for additional information related to the other items on the following schedule 
the summary of restructuring charges and unusual items is as follows summary of restructuring charges and unusual items year ended december in millions  except per share data cost of sales write off of inventory and manufacturing equipment provision for excess and obsolete inventory purchase accounting adjustment impact on gross margin operating expenses purchased research and development expenses restructuring charges litigation settlements loss from continuing operations before income taxes gain on sale of equity securities impact on loss from continuing operations before income taxes tax impact of restructuring charges and unusual items net loss from continuing operations net loss on disposal of discontinued operations pre tax net loss from restructuring charges and unusual items net loss per share from restructuring charges and unusual items local currency results the following discussion of net sales  gross profit margins and operating expenses includes reference to revenue  margins and expenses in local currencies 
for comparability of financial results  the foreign currency balances  in all periods presented  are translated at millipore s budgeted exchange rates which differ from actual rates of exchange 
this provides a clearer presentation of underlying trends in the company s business  before the impact of foreign currency translation 
net sales consolidated net sales  measured in us dollars  decreased percent in  compared to an increase of percent in  and an increase of percent in the net sales decrease in compared to was primarily due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  the ongoing economic difficulties in asian markets and negative currency effects 
the higher sales growth rate in compared to was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of amicon and tylan 
without these acquisitions  sales in declined by percent from levels 
sales growth in was adversely impacted by a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor industry  unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate comparisons and certain other factors discussed below 
sales growth by business segment and geography  measured in local currencies and us dollars  is summarized in the table below 
sales growth in local sales growth in us currencies dollars with without with without acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions acquisitions biopharmaceutical research microelectronics consolidated americas europe asia pacific consolidated biopharmaceutical research sales  measured in local currencies  increased percent in compared to percent in the growth of the biopharmaceutical research segment in reflects the combination of increased demand for consumable products and process equipment used in the production of sterile drugs and analytical and water filtration devices used in research laboratories 
the growth in the americas and europe for this segment is attributable to an increase in the number of new drugs developed through synthetic and natural methods new chemical entities approved and in production 
this segment was adversely affected in asia by a decrease in demand as a result of region wide recessionary pressures 
excluding the impact of the amicon acquisition  sales to the biopharmaceutical research business segment grew percent in in local currencies compared to growth of percent in sales of large protein processing systems in to biotechnology customers were level with those in in addition  sales to a beer manufacturing customer in japan were lower in as compared to these two factors  which were significant in boosting the overall segment growth rate  combined to depress the sales growth rate in new product introductions in and  particularly for laboratory water and applied microbiology products  and new distribution alliances launched late in in the united states have enhanced sales growth in this market 
sales growth in was strongest in europe and the americas 
microelectronics segment sales growth measured in local currency declined percent in compared to an increase of percent for sales growth for excluding the acquisition of tylan was percent 
the decrease in sales was directly attributable to the continuation of the semiconductor industry slump  which began in the middle of the reduction in microelectronics segment revenues generated from the sale of equipment was adversely impacted in asia and the americas by a significant reduction in semiconductor plant construction 
sales of consumable gas and liquid purification devices declined to a lesser extent  consistent with lower worldwide semiconductor plant capacity utilization 
the moderate segment growth of percent before acquisitions in reflects the impact of the aforementioned semiconductor downturn coupled with the asian financial difficulties which began late in that year 
during and the us dollar strengthened against most of the european and asian currencies in which the company transacts business 
the net effect of this currency movement in was to increase the rate of the sales decline by percentage points 
in the stronger dollar decreased reported sales growth and sales growth excluding acquisitions by percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
the us dollar increased in value against the japanese yen in with the net result of decreasing the reported sales growth by percentage points 
as a general matter  a stronger us dollar will adversely affect the sales growth of both business segments to a similar degree 
price changes have not significantly affected the comparability of sales during the past three years 
gross profit margins gross profit margins in local currencies were percent in  percent in  and percent in gross profit margins in were percent excluding the effect of the million charge for the write off of inventory and manufacturing equipment associated with product line rationalization activities and a provision of million for excess and obsolete inventory 
local currency gross profit margins in were percent excluding the effect of an inventory write up to net realizable value of million related to acquisition accounting which in turn resulted in very low margins when this inventory was sold 
gross profit margin percentages  excluding these charges  were lower in than those in reflecting the impact of significantly reduced volumes in the company s manufacturing plants serving the microelectronics segment combined with duplicative manufacturing costs resulting from concurrent operations at three existing plants located in california and texas and operations at the new manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
the redundant facilities were closed in september and their operations consolidated into the allen  texas facility 
the lower gross profit margin in is primarily a result of the impact from the acquired companies 
the gross margin percentages of the acquired businesses  particularly tylan  were less than those of the pre existing company s businesses 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses in local currencies decreased percent in  and increased percent in the decrease in is due to cost containment programs initiated as part of the restructuring activities 
the increase in is due to incremental expenses associated with the acquired businesses 
despite the decrease in spending in  the company continued to invest in sales  service and marketing resources focused on maintaining or improving customer services  supporting the launch of new products and development of future sales initiatives aimed at improving the company s competitive positions 
research and development expenses in local currencies decreased percent in  and increased percent in the decrease in was primarily due to the elimination of research and development expenses for non strategic product lines in the microelectronics segment 
the significant increase in was due to the addition of the acquired businesses 
litigation settlements totaling million were recorded in the first quarter of and are described in legal proceedings below 
gain on sale of equity securities gain on sale of equity securities in primarily reflects the sale of the company s holdings in perseptive biosystems common shares 
as of december  the company held million shares of perseptive biosystems common stock and  shares of perseptive biosystems preferred stock 
on january   perseptive merged with the perkin elmer corporation 
pursuant to the merger  all of the company s holdings of common and preferred shares in perseptive were converted into  shares of perkin elmer common stock 
in the first quarter of  the company sold all of its shares of perkin elmer stock for approximately million in cash 
the company also sold all of its common shares of glyko biomedical ltd 
in the first quarter of and recognized a gain of million 
gain on sale of equity securities in reflected the sale of a portion of the company s holdings in perseptive biosystems common shares 
gain on sale of equity securities in reflected the sale of a significant portion of the company s stock holdings in a japanese company 
the company sold these securities to fund a new headquarters and research and development facility in japan 
the cost of moving to this new facility was million and was recorded in s  g a expense 
net interest expense net interest expense in was million less than  primarily as a result of a yen debt swap agreement entered into during december net interest expense in was significantly higher than net interest expense in due to increased borrowings  which were used to acquire both amicon and tylan 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate from continuing operations in  including the restructuring program  was a benefit of percent 
excluding the effect of the restructuring program  the effective income tax rate was percent 
the company s effective income tax rate in  excluding the non tax deductible write off of purchased research and development associated with the tylan acquisition  was percent compared to percent in the lower effective tax rate in as compared to reflected a higher proportion of income generated by low tax rate manufacturing sites 
net loss on disposal of discontinued operations net loss on disposal of discontinued operations in included an additional after tax charge of million related to previously discontinued operations 
in the company sold it s waters chromatography division and  in a separate transaction  sold certain assets of its non membrane bioscience business 
this charge reflects the final determination of the value of the remaining assets and liabilities associated with these divested operations 
the accounting for these transactions is now complete 
earnings per share earnings per share in were impacted by restructuring charges and several unusual items 
both and earnings per share included significant write offs of purchased research and development associated with the company s acquisition of amicon and tylan 
the impact of these items is reflected in the above schedule of restructuring charges and unusual items 
additionally  earnings per share were adversely impacted by the comparatively stronger us dollar  reducing earnings by per share in as compared to and per share in as compared to market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured both against the us dollar and each other 
the company manages these market risks through its normal financing and operating activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange the company derives approximately percent of its revenues from customers outside of the united states 
this business is transacted through the company s network of international subsidiaries generally in the local currency 
this exposes the company to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can impact revenues  net income and cash flow 
sourcing of product from international subsidiary plants and active management of cross border currency flows partially mitigates the impact of changes in foreign currency 
however  the company has significant exposure to changes in the japanese yen that can not be mitigated through normal financing or operating activities 
accordingly  this risk is managed through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the income and cash flow exposure is managed through the use of option contracts and the net equity exposure is hedged through the use of debt swap agreements 
the company enters into foreign currency option contracts to sell yen on a continuing basis in amounts and timing consistent with the underlying currency transactions 
the gains on these transactions  if any  partially offset the realized foreign exchange losses on the underlying exposure 
gains  net of premium costs  of million in  million in and million in were realized from these contracts and were recorded in cost of sales 
at december  the company had open option contracts to sell yen aggregating million 
all open options expire within months 
premiums to purchase foreign currency option contracts are amortized over the life of the contract 
unamortized premiums of million were included in other current assets as of december  the company s net equity exposure to the japanese yen has been effectively hedged through debt swap agreements covering both principal and interest 
pursuant to these agreements  of debt with a weighted average fixed interest rate of percent was swapped for an equivalent value of yen at a weighted average exchange rate of yen to the dollar and a weighted average fixed interest rate of percent 
the swap agreements mature in and although the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar strengthens against currencies in which the company transacts its business  sales and net income will be adversely impacted 
credit risk the company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and derivative financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents are placed with major financial institutions with high quality credit ratings 
the amount placed with any one institution is limited by policy 
trade receivables credit risk exposure is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographies 
the company is exposed to credit related risks associated with the potential nonperformance by counterparties to the debt swap agreements 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
the company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and limits the amount of contracts it enters into with any one party 
capital resources and liquidity cash flow provided from operations was million in  million in and million in reported cash flow from operations was reduced by million in and million in for costs associated with the restructuring activities and the integration of the amicon and tylan acquisitions 
excluding the restructuring and acquisition related expenditures  cash flow from operations was million in and million in the improvement in cash flow from operations over  excluding the restructuring and acquisition related expenditures  is the result of a decrease in working capital offset by a significant decline in operating income before restructuring charges and unusual items 
the favorable working capital comparisons were a combination of a decrease in accounts receivable balances  lower inventory levels and a reduction in other current assets 
the improvement in receivables reflects the impact of the lower sales volume and improved collection experience 
the improvement in inventory utilization was attributable to asset management initiatives launched in and reserve actions taken as part of the restructuring program 
the reduction in other current assets reflects the sale of equity securities in the decline in operating income resulted from the downturn in the semiconductor industry  the financial difficulties in asia and the strength of the us dollar 
the decrease in cash flow in  excluding the expenditures related to the amicon and tylan acquisitions  compared to that of is attributable to higher levels of working capital and an increase in interest cost 
operating income before these acquisition related charges in was slightly less than that of the increase in working capital comparisons were a combination of increases in both accounts receivable balances and inventory levels as a result of the tylan acquisition in january and an increase in other current assets 
the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to significantly higher revenues in the fourth quarter of versus the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in fourth quarter revenues was principally attributable to the acquisition of tylan in the first quarter of inventory balances increased in anticipation of future demand from customers in the semiconductor market which failed to materialize 
the increase in other current assets reflects the pending sale of equity securities in the first quarter of these securities had previously been recorded in other assets 
the increase in interest expense in is directly related to borrowings used for the acquisition of amicon and tylan 
during the company expects to spend approximately million in cash for costs accrued in connection with the restructuring program and for costs to complete the integration of amicon and tylan 
this will be funded by cash flow from operating activities 
cash generated by the company during was used to invest in property  plant and equipment  and to pay dividends 
property  plant and equipment expenditures for exceeded expenditures by million primarily due to million spent for the expansion of the biopharmaceutical membrane manufacturing facility in cork  ireland and million spent for the construction of the new microelectronics manufacturing facility in allen  texas 
the total cost of the allen facility will be approximately million 
the company expects capital expenditures for to be in the range of to million 
depreciation expense in is expected to be slightly higher than in as a result of the increased capital expenditures in the company has no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december  in  cash generated from operating activities  along with increased borrowings  was used for the acquisition of tylan  the purchase of certain assets and technology of fastar ltd 
and fas holding company  and capital expenditures 
in the company used million of cash from operations to purchase shares of its outstanding common stock 
during and the company continued to invest in capacity expansions and the upgrade of manufacturing facilities and in information technology systems and equipment 
the net cash outflow of million and million in and  respectively  for operations discontinued in were in line with the company s expectations 
at december   the company had no significant remaining obligations related to these discontinued operations 
in may  the company reduced the maximum funds available under its unsecured revolving credit agreement  dated january   the credit agreement from million to million 
the company s financial results for the quarter ended september  made it necessary for the company to renegotiate certain financial covenants relating to operating cash flow and interest coverage under the credit agreement  and under the million percent note due in the note 
pursuant to this renegotiation  the lenders involved waived defaults under those covenants and accepted less restrictive operating cash flow and interest coverage covenants for and a portion of the company agreed to an additional minimum earnings covenant  the payment of amendment fees totaling approximately million  and to increases in both the interest rate and the facility fees thereunder 
interest is payable under the credit agreement at a floating us dollar deposit rate  defined as libor  plus a margin 
the company agreed to an increase in this margin from a range of to percent to a range of to percent 
the company also agreed to an increase in the facility fee under the credit agreement from a rate ranging from to percent to a rate ranging from to percent 
the interest rate under the note also increased from percent to percent as of november  in november moody s investor services downgraded the company s debt rating to ba from baa  a rating which moody s characterizes as below investment grade 
standard poors corporation also downgraded the company s debt rating from bbb to bb 
the company expects that this development may make it more difficult for the company to access money markets should it become necessary to do so 
the use of debt to finance the acquisitions of amicon and tylan substantially increased the company s debt to equity ratio 
in the first quarter of  the company successfully completed a public debt offering 
proceeds from the offering of million were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
at december   the company had additional borrowing capacity of million under its credit agreement 
the company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents  funds available under the credit agreement and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve to twenty four months 
however  given the company s current debt ratings  if the company should need to obtain additional borrowings  there can be no assurance that such borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates 
dividends the quarterly dividend was increased in the second quarter of from to per share 
dividends paid in were million 
euro on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign legacy currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges and the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating greater cross border price transparency 
the company is assessing its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
the company has assessed its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies  and is reviewing whether certain existing customer pricing and vendor contracts will need to be modified 
the currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
final accounting  tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance are not available 
the company is evaluating issues involving introduction of the euro 
the company began processing customer orders and invoicing in euro during the first week of january based on current information and current assessments  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
year the company is aware of the year issue that will affect certain products and systems that were not designed to properly handle the transition between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company has recognized the need to ensure that its business operations will not be adversely impacted by the year accordingly  the company has authorized an internal team to assess the company s year readiness and to determine the steps necessary to address its year issues 
among the areas that have been or are being assessed are the company s internal information systems  its manufacturing equipment  its facilities and its products 
in addition  the team has begun the assessment of the year readiness of the company s key suppliers and financial institutions 
as part of the assessment of its year readiness  the company has identified and substantially completed testing of its key internal information systems which includes order entry  manufacturing and financial systems as well as its facilities  manufacturing and other key systems for year compliance 
the testing to date has identified no significant issues 
by mid  the company expects to complete implementation of all modifications or replacements necessary to make all key systems year compliant 
the company has nearly completed its testing of the year compliance of its products 
a large majority of the company s products do not present year compliance issues  and for those products that do present issues the company has communicated with its customers regarding appropriate solutions 
in addition to testing of the company s internal systems and its products  the company has begun implementing its plan of communication with its suppliers and financial institutions regarding their year readiness and the year compliance of the products and services that they provide to the company 
as of december  the company has not identified any important year readiness issues of its key supply chain partners 
the company expects to substantially complete its risk analysis and to develop contingency plans where reasonably possible for dealing with any risks raised by such non readiness before july the company currently estimates that the total costs that will be incurred in its year assessment and remediation program will be in the range of million to million  of which approximately million has been incurred through december  incremental spending has not been and is not expected to be material because most year readiness costs will be met with amounts that are normally budgeted for procurement and maintenance of the company s information systems and infrastructure 
however  the redirection of spending to the implementation of its year readiness program may in some instances delay productivity improvements 
the year presents a number of risks and uncertainties that could affect the company notwithstanding the successful implementation of its year readiness program 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  failure of utilities or transportation systems  competition for personnel skilled in remediation of year issues  and the nature of government responses to the year though the company continues to believe that the year will not have a material impact on its business  financial condition or results of operations  the occurrence of any of the above risks or uncertainties or the failure to successfully implement the company s year readiness program could result in such a material impact

in order to fund the transfer  in the second quarter of the company made a contribution of million to its retirement plan in accordance with erisa funding requirements 
business outlook and uncertainties the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
sales the semiconductor industry in which the microelectronics business segment participates is highly cyclical 
the current downturn began in the middle of and is expected to continue into independent market research for the semiconductor industry suggests that a moderate growth cycle will begin in the second half of with stronger growth in however  capital equipment sales which represents approximately percent of microelectronics revenues could lag the industry upturn due to excess capacity in certain segments of the market 
the biopharmaceutical research segment has demonstrated relatively stable patterns of revenue growth 
customers in this segment  particularly those involved in the production of sterile drugs  purchase standardized products for use in validated production processes 
accordingly  it is important to participate in the development of new drugs new chemical entities in order to be designed into the ultimate manufacturing process 
adoption of new technologies and products requires a lengthy validation process prior to adoption 
the growth of this segment is highly leveraged on the development and approval of new chemical entities 
it is difficult to ascertain the number or timing of such approvals  however  the number of drugs at various stages in the approval process has increased significantly over the past two years 
the remaining driver of this segment is research and development spending which has been relatively stable and is expected to continue with growth in the mid single digits 
both of the company s business segments were adversely impacted by the financial difficulties in the asian economies  which began in late and continued through the continuation of these conditions would moderate the growth rate of both segments 
approximately percent of the company s sales are to customers outside of the united states and are generally made in local currency 
as previously noted  sales and earnings were negatively impacted by a strong us dollar  particularly against the japanese yen and the korean won 
late in  both of these currencies began to show signs of strengthening 
however  in early  european currencies have weakened offsetting the impact of the stronger asian currencies 
therefore if foreign exchange rates remain at the march  level  there will be a minimal foreign exchange impact on first quarter and full year reported sales growth as compared to any change in foreign exchange rates will be reflected in the results of operations 
gross margins the company expects gross margin percentages in to improve as compared with those of margins will benefit from the impact of various restructuring programs and the increased volume in the company s manufacturing plants to support anticipated sales growth 
to the extent that foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar remain at march  levels  first quarter and full year margins will not be significantly impacted from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses the company expects that operating expenses in local currencies  as a percentage of sales  in will be consistent with the percentage achieved in previous years 
interest expense the company expects net interest expense in will be slightly higher than as a result of the revised terms for the credit agreement and the note  as previously noted  net of the impact of anticipated reduced short term borrowings 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in is projected to be in the range of percent  consistent with the effective rate for  excluding the effect of the restructuring program 
the tax rate estimate is based on the company s current expectations for income and current tax law and  therefore  is subject to change 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of million 
although realization of the asset is not assured  the company believes it is more likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if the near term estimates of future taxable income are reduced  which could result in the company s effective tax rate increasing above the expected range of percent 
capital spending the company expects to spend between to million for fixed asset additions in the company does not believe it needs to significantly expand or add manufacturing capacity in to handle its anticipated sales growth 
the company will continue to invest in tooling within its manufacturing plants and in information technology 
accordingly  the company also expects that depreciation expense will be higher than depreciation expense 
forward looking statements the matters discussed herein  as well as in future oral and written statements by management of the company  that are forward looking statements  are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
when used herein or in such statements  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  will  should or the negative thereof and similar expressions as they relate to the company or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
in addition to the matters discussed herein  potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results include  without limitation  foreign exchange rates  increased regulatory concerns on the part of the biopharmaceutical industry  further consolidation of drug manufacturers  competitive factors such as new membrane technology  and or a new method of chip manufacture which relies less heavily on purified chemicals and gases  availability of component products on a timely basis  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  change in product mix  conditions in the economy in general  including uncertainties in selected asian economies  and in the microelectronics manufacturing market in particular  the difficulty in integrating acquired companies  the failure to realize the savings contemplated by certain restructuring activities  potential environmental liabilities  the inability to utilize technology in current or planned products due to overriding rights by third parties  and the other risk factors described elsewhere in this form k annual report  and in particular the matters described in item above under the heading environmental matters
