item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a clinical research organization providing a broad range of integrated product development services on a global basis to its clients in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries 
the company s products and services are provided  both in the united states and internationally  through two business segments clinical operations  which include centralized diagnostic testing services  clinical trial management services and clinical data management services  and technology operations  which includes the development  marketing and support of clinical trial and data management software  support and consulting services 
the company had operated a phase i clinical research unit  which was closed in the first quarter of the company s centralized diagnostic testing services are on a fee for service basis and contracts generally have terms of one month to two years 
a portion of the company s fee frequently is paid upon contract execution as a non refundable up front payment  with the remaining amounts billed monthly 
clinical trial and data management services are generally fixed priced contracts  with certain variable components  and range in duration from a few months to two years 
a portion of the company s fee frequently is paid upon contract execution as a non refundable up front payment  with the balance billed in accordance with the contract terms 
the company s contracts generally may be terminated with or without cause on to days notice 
clients terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the failure of the product s being tested to satisfy safety or efficacy requirements  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  and production problems resulting in shortages of required supplies 
revenues from clinical trial software and services are derived primarily from software license fees  software maintenance and support and consulting services 
revenues from centralized diagnostic testing services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from clinical trial and data management services are generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis as work is performed 
the company regularly subcontracts with third party investigators in connection with clinical trials and with other third party providers for specialized services 
these and other reimbursable costs are paid by the company and reimbursed by clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in revenues 
since reimbursed costs may vary significantly from contract to contract and are not meaningful for analyzing trends in revenues  they are included in gross revenues but excluded from net revenues 
revenues from technology software licenses are recognized upon shipment of the software and related documentation when collectibility is deemed probable and the license fee is deemed fixed and determinable 
revenues from software maintenance and continuing support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the period in which the software maintenance and continuing support is provided  generally twelve months

in addition  net revenues include the recognition of million for work completed under a contract which was cancelled before completion 
clinical trial and data management services increased or million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the same twelve months in the increase in clinical trial and data management net revenues is attributable to recognition of part of the backlog and new contracts signed in the increase in clinical trial and data management net revenues includes million generated from the company s uk operation  which didn t offer such services until late technology operations net revenue results for reflect the full year effect of the acquisition of dlb systems  which occurred in october technology net revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  other net revenues result from the company s phase i clinical research unit which was closed during the first quarter of phase i net revenues for the twelve months ended december  were million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  direct costs increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in overall direct costs reflects the full year impact of dlb operations  acquired in october   the personnel and related expense impact of increased staffing needed to support increased net revenues and the full year impact of the company s decision to build its international clinical trials and data management service capabilities in europe  which began in late direct costs  as a percent of net revenues  declined to in from in the decrease in direct costs as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the full year impact of dlb systems  whose products and services have lower direct costs as a percentage of revenues  recognition of million in net revenues for work completed under a contract which was cancelled before completion  closure of the phase i unit which had a higher percentage of direct cost to net revenues and to the overall increase in net revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is the result of the full year impact of dlb systems  acquired in october  the full year impact of increases to the company s domestic infrastructure to promote and support future growth in operations and the full year impact of the company s decision to build its international clinical trials and data management service capabilities 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to for the twelve months ended december  compared to for the same twelve months of the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the company s ability to spread the fixed portion of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the year to year increase was due to the full year impact of the dlb system s goodwill amortization and increased capital expenditures in other income of million during the year ended december  declined from the million reported for the year ended december  other income resulted primarily from income earned on investment of the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering in february the company had an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  compared to a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the company s effective income tax rate for the year ended december   was  compared to for the year ended december  year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net revenues decreased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  clinical operations net revenues decreased or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in central diagnostic testing service revenues for the year ended december   primarily the result of several significant ecg contracts  which were ongoing in  being completed in early  with a low level of new ecg contracts initiated in partially offsetting the decrease in central diagnostic testing service revenues  were increased clinical trial and data management net revenues 
the clinical trial and data management net revenue growth was attributable to the company s increased service capabilities developed during revenues for the year ended december  were also increased by million in connection with a payment received in the first quarter for a licensing agreement termination

liquidity and capital resources the clinical research and technology industries generally are not very capital intensive 
the company s principal cash needs relate to funding receivables as client payments generally lag up to days after the invoice date 
in february  the company completed the initial public offering of its common stock  which resulted in proceeds from the offering  net of expenses  of million 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the company generally places its investments in ap rated commercial bonds and paper  municipal securities and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than one year 
for the year ended december   the company used cash in operating activities of million compared to cash used by operations of million during the year ended december  the decrease in operating cash usage was due primarily to the company s net profit of million compared to a net loss of million in and an increase in deferred revenues 
this was partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses in during the year ended december   the company purchased million of property and equipment compared to million purchased in the increase in the purchase of property and equipment reflects the needs to support the overall growth in the business 
on july   the company made an investment of million for a minority equity position in americasdoctors 
com  inc  an internet company which provides real time physician chat  referrals and health care events access on america online s health web site 
on july   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase  over time  of up to  shares of the company s common stock at prices determined appropriate by the company 
as of december   the company had used 
million to repurchase  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
during the year ended december   the company received 
million in cash from the exercise of  employee stock options at an average exercise price per option of 
the company has a line of credit arrangement with first union national bank totaling million 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the line 
the company expects that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and borrowings under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and the company may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to the company 
year the company is aware of the issues and problems associated with the year date change 
the company has been addressing company wide data processing and infrastructure issues since premier research has undertaken a year compliance plan that will be completed by september  in addition  the company also plans to have all clinical systems year compliant by june  the purpose of this plan is to assure that premier research  as a corporate entity  has assessed and taken appropriate actions necessary to become compliant with any issues regarding year requirements 
the problems surrounding year compliance are of extreme concern to the company  since premier research is a clinical research organization providing diagnostic testing and clinical research services to the pharmaceutical industry  as well as a developer of clinical database management software 
the company produces and delivers information that is date sensitive  especially in deriving date and time calculations  premier research currently can provide to its clients  date formats that contain century markers or digit year fields for any of its clinical and diagnostic information 
the company s strategy to address year compliance is to replace potentially non compliant software and hardware with new compliant systems or updated year compliant versions 
the inventory and assessment phases of the year plan have primarily been completed for its hardware and software systems 
the company has begun its remediation phase of the plan through the replacement and updating of systems 
as of today over of the company s information technology infrastructure has been assessed and found to be free from any year issues 
those that have shown not to be in compliance are currently being evaluated and renovated for compliance 
if a system can not be made compliant to the requirements  the system will be replaced with one that is compliant 
the company is also assessing its facilities worldwide that it leases or owns  and plans to complete its deployment of applicable contingency plans by september  the company is also assessing and surveying its suppliers of third party products and services 
based upon information received from such parties  the company believes that most of its suppliers are developing  assessing and remediating any issues associated with their year plans 
the company cannot at this time fully assess the status of its suppliers until they have completed their own efforts 
it will review the readiness of the suppliers on an on going basis throughout the remainder of the year and will implement specific actions to rectify potential problems in its supply chain 
as with any other company in its industry or any business in general  the company is exposed to risks associated with failures in the private and public sector to become year compliant 
these risks include the possibility that public infrastructure systems  such as electricity  water  natural gas or telecommunications may fail in this country and other countries in the world that the company does business 
in addition  there are those risks that the internal systems of the company s suppliers  service providers and customers will fail 
the company also relies considerably on travel and could be adversely affected  if air and train travel is disrupted by issues related to the year the company also relies heavily on the healthcare industry 
this industry and its related clinical investigational sites may not have focused their efforts on the year issue to the same degree 
thus the company has an increased risk that its investigational sites  necessary for the conduct of clinical trials  will be unable to provide timely answers and data that it needs to perform services on time to its contractual clients 
also  the failure of the company s customers to address the year issue could negatively impact on their ability to use the company s services 
while contingency plans will be developed to address these risks  the company cannot assure that those plans will sufficiently protect the company from the effects of those risks 
any disruptions from the realization of any of these risks could adversely affect the company s ability to perform its services 
the company estimates that the costs associated with its year program will be approximately million  including costs already incurred 
total year costs of approximately million have been incurred by the company through december  the estimates of cost  timing and impact of addressing the year issue are based on numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  the ability of the company to meet its deadlines and the cooperation of third parties 
however  there can be no guarantee that the assumptions will be correct and that these estimates will be achieved 
actual results could differ significantly from those expected by the company 
inflation the company believes the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
cautionary statement for forward looking information statements included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations set forth above may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties such as competitive factors  technology development  market demand and the company s ability to obtain new contracts and accurately estimate net revenues due to variability in size  scope and duration of projects  and internal issues of the sponsoring client 
further  information on potential factors that could affect the company s financial results can be found in the company s registration statement on form s and its reports on forms k and q filed with the securities and exchange commission 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company generally places its investments in ap rated commercial bonds and paper  municipal securities and certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year 
the company actively manages its portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities but in order to ensure liquidity  will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
the company has not and does not hold any derivatives related to its interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect of the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  the company s interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on the company s future interest income  of future changes in investment yields  will depend largely on the gross amount of the company s investments 
see liquidity and capital resources 
foreign currency risk the company operates on a global basis from locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
all international net revenues are billed and expenses incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the income statement of our uk entity from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
the company does not hedge translation risks because any cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested 
to date  the effect of foreign currency fluctuations are reflected in the company s operating results and have not been material 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported operating loss for international operations by less than  the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place in january the company has not determined what impact  if any  the euro will have on the company s foreign exchange exposure
