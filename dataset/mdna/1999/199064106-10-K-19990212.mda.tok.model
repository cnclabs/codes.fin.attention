item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following summarizes the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the information below and elsewhere in this form k may contain certain forward looking statements that have been based on imprecise assumptions with regard to production levels  price realizations  and expenditures for exploration and development and anticipated results therefrom 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed herein or implied by such statements 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal yielded the lowest average worldwide and domestic crude oil prices in more than ten years for the domestic industry and for columbus 
the company s average natural gas prices were lower than in but natural gas production was up compared to also  fiscal had substantially higher exploration expenses and impairment charges that generated a net loss and overshadowed record natural gas production 
those charges totaled  which  after being tax effected  reduced net earnings by  or per share and resulted in a loss of  or per share 
discretionary cash flow in of  was primarily reduced by weak product prices and lower oil production and was significantly lower than s record cash flow of  gross revenues and oil and gas sales were also lower in with prices the primary culprit 
as of the end of  shareholders equity had decreased to  compared to  at november  due to higher exploration and impairment charges and repurchase of treasury stock 
positive working capital of  at year end  combined with the company s anticipated cash flow for should provide sufficient funds for the expected fiscal capital expenditure program 
this primarily includes developing undeveloped reserves and funding an exploratory program in the lower gulf coast area near its el squared discovery 
success to date with the texas exploratory wildcats in this area has been extremely encouraging 
the unused portion of the  bank credit facility has previously been primarily targeted by management for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  but can be used for any legal corporate purpose and also is available should there be unforeseen capital expenditures required during generally accepted accounting principles gaap require cash flows from operating activities to be determined after giving effect to working capital changes 
accordingly  gaap s net cash provided from operating activities has fluctuated widely from  to  during the last three years which  coupled with use of the company s credit facility  has provided sufficient liquidity to fund those three years oil and gas capital expenditures  treasury share repurchases  and limited purchases of fractional working interests in existing properties 
however  management places greater reliance upon an important alternative method of computing cash flow generally known as discretionary cash flow dcf which is not gaap but is commonly used in the industry 
this method calculates cash flow before considering either working capital changes or deduction of explora tion expenses as the latter can be increased or decreased at management s discretion 
dcf is often used by successful efforts companies when making comparisons with the cash flow results of independent energy companies which use the full cost accounting method where exploration expenses are capitalized and therefore do not adversely affect either operating cash flow or net earnings immediately 
columbus dcf for was  which compared to s  an all time record and was a decrease that was primarily attributable to prevailing lower crude oil and natural gas prices 
dcf is also calculated without debt retirements being considered but in columbus case it does not matter since outstanding bank debt requires no principal payments before august  interest expense on the outstanding debt has been relatively insignificant and is always deducted before computing dcf anyway 
management continues to note in all public filings and reports its strong exception to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
which directs that operating cash flow must only be determined after consideration of working capital changes 
this position is based on our belief such a requirement by gaap ignores entirely the significant impact that the timing of income received for  and expenses incurred on behalf of  third party owners in properties has on working capital where columbus owns only a small working interest but is the operator 
however  neither dcf nor operating cash flow before working capital changes may be substituted for net income or for cash available from operations as defined by gaap 
furthermore  currently reported cash flows  however defined  are not necessarily indicative that there will be sufficient funds for all future cash requirements 
for gaap cash flow was higher than dcf and  for the prior two years  it was the reverse 
at the present time the company has no hedges in place of either crude oil or natural gas prices similar to those swaps it negotiated in prior years as discussed below 
therefore  the company s current oil and gas revenues are fully exposed to risk of declining prices such as have occurred most of fiscal thus  it will be able to fully benefit from any price increases should these occur during fiscal in prior years columbus hedged both natural gas and crude oil prices by entering into swaps which were matched against the calendar monthly average price on the nymex and settled monthly 
revenues were decreased when the market price at settlement exceeded the contract swap price or increased when the contract swap price exceeded the market price 
the following table shows the results of these swaps increase decrease in oil and gas revenues volume description per mo 
period mmbtu or bbl natural gas mmbtu   futures contracts 
  mmbtu   crude oil bbl    bbl with bbl cap 
   the company s natural gas and crude oil swaps were considered financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which were in the normal course of business to partially reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas 
those instruments involved  to varying degrees  elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
the company had no natural gas or crude oil swaps outstanding as of november  columbus had outstanding borrowings of  as of november  against its  line of credit with norwest bank denver  na which is collateralized by its oil and gas properties 
at the end of  the ratio of bank debt to shareholders equity was and to total assets was 
the outstanding debt used a libor option with an average interest rate of 
subsequent to year end through january   the debt was decreased by  to  the net increase or decrease in long term debt directly affects cash flows from financing activities as do the purchase of treasury shares and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
working capital at year end remained positive at  compared to  at november  this was achieved despite capital expenditures of  for additions to oil and gas properties as well as the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for  during the year and benefited from a  increase in current portion of deferred income taxes 
the company has been authorized by its board of directors to repurchase its common shares from the market at various prices during the last several years 
those repurchases are summarized as follows shares fiscal year average repurchased as purchased restated price restated for stock split and stock dividends as of november  a total of  shares remained to be purchased from the most recent authorization at a price not to exceed per share 
as of january    of those shares have been acquired at an average price of per share 
during  capital expenditures actually incurred on oil and gas properties totaled  which amount differs from the capital expenditure shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the latter also includes cash payments made during for expenditures incurred but not yet paid as of s year end 
similarly  there have been expenditures accrued in that will not be actually paid until these were primarily for the exploratory program in the texas gulf coast area 
impact of the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four  or other methods  to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year and could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations such as a temporary inability to process transactions  transmit invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company upgraded its major system computer software in to a new release of a major software vendor that is compliant with the year columbus has started its review of other less important systems as well as its significant suppliers  purchasers  and transporters of oil and gas to determine the extent to which the company might still be vulnerable to other failures and what the impact might be on its operations 
the company s interest in wells operated by other companies is not considered to be as important but management is attempting to determine if those companies are ready for the year outside services are used for payroll and medical benefits processing and those companies provided updates to their software that is year compliant by year end the company is also somewhat dependent upon personal computers as well as certain spreadsheet and word processing software programs which may not be year ready at present 
evaluations will be made to establish which of those systems are critical and need to be remedied 
the company also relies on non information technology systems  such as office telephones  facsimile machines  air conditioning  heating and elevators in its leased office building  which may have embedded technology such as micro controllers and are generally outside of its control to assess or remedy 
these might adversely impact the company s business but in management s opinion would not create a material disruption 
as previously disclosed  the major system computer software upgrade performed in cost  management expects that this represents the majority of the costs  including replacement of any non compliant information technology system  required to meet its goal of being year ready for mission critical systems 
the company does not believe that any loss of revenue will occur as a result of the year problem but regardless of efforts to identify and remedy such problems  there could be year related failures that cause some disruption 
the company has not established a contingency plan should year failures occur and has not determined if it will in fact create a contingency plan 
results of operations the company s gross revenues of million were below s and  as noted previously  the decrease was caused primarily by lower prices 
because of continued low crude oil prices  over half of the company s operated wells in the williston basin have been rendered uneconomic and have either been shut down or are being operated only a few days each month 
furthermore  gross revenues of million were above s which was attributable to higher prices and what was then a record level of natural gas production plus improved crude oil production generated by the company s drilling program 
the operating loss of  in was a direct result of a significant increase in impairments  lower revenues  plus higher lease operating expenses and exploration costs versus operating income of  in represented an improvement of only over but without higher exploratory charges and impairment provisions  the increase would have been 
the net loss of  was primarily attributable to the impairment expense although all of the factors previously discussed contributed to this result 
net earnings during set a new high from us only operations of  which surpassed earnings of  had there not been the extremely high non cash impairment provisions during  record net earnings would have surpassed earlier years results which also included canadian operations 
impairments the fiscal non cash impairment loss of  was recognized during the first and fourth quarters with provisions of  and  respectively 
the primary cause for each was the continued low crude oil prices which showed signs of recovery throughout the year but had retreated to the lows by year end 
this resulted in a significant reduction in total reserve quantities which are based on the sec calculation method using constant prices 
the carrying value of remaining unamortized costs in several successful efforts pools still exceeded the resultant undiscounted future net cash flows even when determined using somewhat higher crude prices than were currently being realized 
several property pools had been initially written down as of the end of the first quarter to a fair value based on an assumption that the average future crude oil price over the life of reserves would be per barrel 
this was lowered to at year end based on bearish longer term sentiments expressed by many noted experts 
the actual year end price calculation eliminated certain proved undeveloped locations as no longer being economic and it also further shortened the economic productive life of most oil wells 
when a price was used over the life of the reserves  it required an additional non cash impairment for the fourth quarter of  although some undeveloped oil reserves would be restored 
there was a  charge included in the first quarter provision for probable loss in value of undeveloped acreage and abandonments of leaseholds located primarily in louisiana which was in addition to the  reserved in this louisiana austin chalk horizontal well  the morrow h  had reserves originally assigned to an extension of the current downdip lateral but were eliminated by price and performance and contributed heavily to the first quarter provision 
also  the necessary recompletion workover to place the updip lateral on production was theoretically postponed 
although economic at a per barrel crude oil price  this recompletion was deferred for two more years for expected better prices which altered the present worth of those reserves and also contributed to the fourth quarter provisions 
non cash impairment losses of  for and  for was recognized for certain oklahoma development oil and gas wells completed in prior years which had become marginal 
during the third quarter of  despite the fact that a production test of the morrow h had not yet occurred  management chose to write off as impaired certain small leaseholds in the acreage block where the possibility of putting together a drilling unit before exploration was rather remote 
also included were leaseholds where annual rentals were already due or about to be due 
these non cash write downs amounted to  bringing the total impairment provision during the third quarter of to  as fiscal closed  it became clearer that because of increasing water cuts the morrow h s oil production rates would be less than the initial potential tests had indicated 
accordingly  s year end proved reserves attributable to both horizontal legs were reduced which resulted in further impairment charges of  related to this louisiana well and  to leaseholds 
as previously indicated  a general provision for all undeveloped leaseholds was recorded in the amount of  where  based upon management s opinion  further development probably could not be completed in time prior to lease expirations 
also  two oil wells in oklahoma which had failed to respond to attempts to eliminate shifting frac sand from halting production were charged with additional impairment of  of the total year end amount 
those wells have not been abandoned permanently and may be returned to production when better crude prices are available 
oil and gas operations the following discussion of the company s oil and gas operations is based upon the tables of production and average prices shown under the caption item  oil and gas properties and production 
the changes in the components of oil and gas revenues during the periods presented are summarized as follows production price change quantity change revenue change vs 
gas oil vs 
gas oil columbus record sales volumes of natural gas averaged  mcf per day while oil and liquids production declined to barrels per day and equate to daily production of  barrels of oil equivalent boe 
this was essentially flat with daily production of  boe during with the increase in natural gas production during and a decrease of in oil production  the company now produces approximately of its volumes from natural gas 
this swing in percentage resulted from the emphasis change initiated by management last year and has proved to be a correct shift as the price of crude oil remained at low levels 
natural gas revenues for decreased compared to primarily as a result of lower prices which overcame improved gas production from new wells in the texas gulf coast area 
these new discoveries offset normal annual production declines plus the sale of a berry r 
cox field property in texas during fourth quarter average prices for natural gas decreased compared to with a lack of increased demand due to a warm winter and the highest percentage of storage refill ever accomplished during oil revenues for were down by a significant compared with as a result of a substantial decrease in the average price plus a lower sales volume of 
the latter directly reflected a very sharp decline of a owned montana oil well which had been recompleted uphole during s third quarter and contributed its initial flush production for the last few months of last year 
furthermore  during s third quarter  several oil wells became marginal because of low prices and were shut down 
also  any well which had pump or tubing problems was not repaired nor were workovers performed as needed 
unfortunately no crude oil swap was in place during to offer protection from this latest price debacle but was in place during a portion of when prices were high 
natural gas revenues in increased over s as a result of both higher volumes and prices 
average prices for natural gas increased in versus due to strong demand and a fairly tight supply of gas in excess of storage injection requirements 
gas revenues for were reduced by  
per mcf and s revenues were reduced by  
per mcf from swaps of natural gas in those years 
sales volumes improved by over as a result of numerous gas wells being completed and connected in texas later in the preceding year and early oil revenues for managed improvement over as a result of a sales volume and average price increase of each 
crude oil production reversed its normal decline over a several year period because new oil wells were completed in which generated such an improvement 
new oil and condensate production in montana and chambers county  texas during was essentially offset by reductions in harris county  texas and north dakota and by properties that were sold in late oil revenues for were decreased by  
per barrel while revenues were reduced by  per barrel from crude oil swaps 
natural gas revenues for compared to in the us increased despite reductions from swaps as a result of a higher price and a increase in production 
average prices improved because of increased demand and severely depleted storage levels following an extended winter heating season 
natural gas revenues for were reduced by  
per mcf from swaps of natural gas while had increased revenues of  
per mcf 
production volumes for increased as a result of property acquisitions and the effects of newly developed wells 
oil revenues in the us for were up from as a result of a increase in the average price received and higher volumes 
oil revenues and average prices for were reduced by  per barrel due to hedging activity and no oil hedges existed in crude oil production in improved because of two new jackson sand oil well completions in the sralla road field plus a third well wi gas condensate discovery extended the field one mile southwest and commenced production in november 
these increases overcame normal production declines elsewhere 
us oil prices have fluctuated for several years with the same wide swings experienced in world crude oil price 
during the spring of crude oil prices rose quickly to above per barrel  declined briefly  then again rose rapidly to almost per barrel by year end 
during crude oil prices steadily softened and declined each quarter 
this trend continued during most of and ended the year at about per barrel 
lease operating expenses increased in over because of expensive workovers along with downhole and surface equipment replacements on several older wells 
lease operating expenses for were lower than despite more wells in operation because the prior year had several expensive workovers performed and production equipment replaced 
lease operating expenses for us wells only increased in over because of incremental working interest acquisitions and several extensive work overs performed 
lease operating costs on a barrel of oil equivalent basis for rose to compared to in but down from for operating costs as a percentage of revenues increased to in due to lower prices and higher costs 
during they decreased to due to increased production and product prices while they were in with lower prices and production 
production and property taxes approximated of revenues in and and of revenues in these vary based on texas percentage share of the total production where oil tax rates are lower than gas tax rates 
the relationship of taxes and revenue is not always directly proportional since several of the local jurisdiction s property taxes are based upon reserve evaluations as opposed to revenues received or production rates for a given tax period 
operating and management services this segment of the company s business is comprised of operations and services conducted on behalf of third parties including compressor rentals and salt water disposal facilities 
operating and management services revenue has increased in each of the last three years 
operating and management services gross profit was  during compared to a  profit during this decline was due to unusually high workover expenses required to clean out sand from the well bore of a salt water disposal well in texas 
revenues improved during s second half as the number of operated wells and drilling activity increased along with an increase from to ownership interest in four compressors operating in south texas 
operating and management services profit of  compared to a  profit for because the number of operated wells and drilling activity increased in interest income interest income is earned primarily from short term investments whose rates fluctuate with changes in the commercial paper rates and the prime rate 
interest income decreased in to  when compared to  in  reflecting a decreased amount of investments and lower short term interest rates 
interest income increased slightly in to  compared to as a result of higher short term interest rates realized and despite a decreased amount of investments 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are considered to be those which relate to the direct costs of the company which do not originate from operation of properties or providing of services 
corporate expense represents a major part of this category 
the company s general and administrative expenses for were higher than last year due primarily to higher medical claims and increased incentive bonuses 
these bonuses are discretionary and directly related to the company s performance during the prior year not and totaled   non cash as of may  compared to   non cash in may  also  some cost increases in resulted from salary adjustments granted effective december  for non officer employees as well as may  for officers 
medical claims under the company s self insured plan vary from year to year with no discernible pattern 
for legal and accounting expenses decreased because had included costs related to a registration statement which was canceled 
reimbursement for services provided by columbus officers and employees for managing resources decreased during and is scheduled to end on march  columbus provided resources with a day notice of termination of the services contract and will completely withdraw from providing personnel services 
resources elected a new president and chief executive officer who purchased a equity position in resources as of june  and he has subsequently added to resources staff 
columbus general and administrative expense will rise commensurately since staff reductions are not presently contemplated although some contract services should be reduced 
reimbursement of  for compares with  during and  in was received for providing services to resources 
the company s general and administrative expenses in were similarly higher than s due to salary increases in may for officers and in december for employees along with incentive bonuses in may the latter were discretionary and were actually based on the company s performance in total bonuses of   non cash in compared to  all non cash in another major source of this increase in was legal and accounting expenses which had been accrued in connection with preparation of a registration statement which was withdrawn because of the rapid paydown of debt from accelerating cash flow 
the company s expenses for were lower than for all of because salary and staff reductions occurred in august which affected the whole year 
also  incentive bonuses all non cash totaled only  in compared to  granted in may  depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets are calculated based upon the units of production for the period compared to proved reserves of each successful efforts property pool 
this expense is not only directly related to the level of production  but also is dependent upon past costs to find  develop and recover related reserves in each of the cost pools or fields 
depreciation and amortization of office equipment and computer software is also included in the total charge 
this expense item for increased over as a result of increased production and development expenditures which occurred in the intervening period while there was a reduction in reserves in several cost pools brought about by lower crude oil prices 
total charges for depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased for over due to increased production and added development expenditures during the intervening period 
total charges for depletion expense for oil and gas properties increased in over due to greater production and despite the benefit realized from the write down of the carrying value of certain properties upon adoption of sfas directly related to reduced crude oil reserves in certain cost pools the depletion and depreciation rate for fiscal reached per barrel of oil equivalent boe 
this compared to per boe for fiscal and per boe in effective october  the company sold its fractional working interests in seven wells in the berry cox field in texas for cash proceeds of  these wells were a part of a larger pool of properties in the general laredo area for purposes of calculating depletion so those sale proceeds were credited to the costs of the successful efforts pool and no book gain or loss was recognized 
the reduction in proved reserves connected with the sale may result in a small increase in that pool s depletion rate in future periods 
exploration expense in general  the exploration expense category includes the cost of company wide efforts to acquire and explore new prospective areas 
the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties requires expensing the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells 
other exploratory charges such as seismic and geological costs must also be immediately expensed regardless of whether a prospect is ultimately proved to be successful 
all such exploration charges not only decrease net earnings but also reduce reported gaap cash flow from operations even though they are discretionary expenses  however  such charges are added back for purposes of determining dcf which is why it more nearly tracks cash flow reported by full cost accounting companies who capitalize such costs 
exploration expense for of  included two exploratory dry holes 
in the se froid area in montana  was expensed while in the texas gulf coast area the second dry hole cost  at present no exploratory oil wells can be justified on any of the d seismic structures mapped on the company s williston basin leasehold blocks in montana until crude oil prices significantly improve 
early in d seismic costs of  were incurred in this area in anticipation there would be an improvement in crude oil prices and because of leasehold expirations due to occur during exploration charges for were also up significantly to  from  in these included  of d seismic costs incurred in the se froid area in montana which located new exploratory well sites  and  incurred for drilling a non commercial exploratory oil well 
during  was expensed when two oklahoma exploratory wells drilled proved non economic 
most of the balance of the expense was for geological consulting 
during  seismic survey costs of  were incurred in canada and expensed while undeveloped leasehold costs in north dakota were impaired by  both of which contributed to a total exploration expense of  litigation expense the litigation expense in relates to the maris e 
penn  et al lawsuit previously described for which charges have only just begun 
interest expense interest expense varies in direct proportion to the amount of bank debt and the level of bank interest rates 
the average amount outstanding has been higher during than in the average bank interest rate paid for debt in  and was   and  respectively 
income taxes the company s income tax position is complex 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards by the company has been complicated by two change of ownership transactions under section of the internal revenue code  one of which occurred on october  and the other on august  only the first of those changes has limited the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
furthermore  a quasi reorganization occurred on december  which requires that benefits from net operating loss carryforwards or any other tax credits that arose prior to the quasi reorganization be credited to additional paid in capital rather than to income 
only post quasi reorganization tax benefits realized can be credited to income 
as a result of available net operating loss carryforwards  the company s federal income tax obligations have been limited to alternative minimum tax so that the company has had a current federal tax payable of less than of pre tax earnings 
in  the company has a net operating loss carryforward from and operating loss carryforwards remaining from periods prior to the first section ownership change 
utilization of those latter benefits are limited to  per year so that the company s current federal tax provision and liability may increase in and thereafter unless an active drilling program is maintained 
in addition  the company pays state income taxes 
during  the net deferred tax asset was  and is comprised of a  current portion and a  long term tax liability 
the valuation allowance was decreased by a net  a deduction of  for the benefit of stock options that were exercised was added to additional paid in capital 
during  there was a net deferred tax liability of  which was comprised of  current portion and  long term liability 
the valuation allowance had a net reduction of  from to november  a deduction of  for the benefit of disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options was added to additional paid in capital 
during  the net deferred tax asset was reduced to  which was comprised of  current deferred tax asset and  long term liability 
the valuation allowance had a net reduction of  from to november  a deduction of  for the benefit of disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options was added to additional paid in capital 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  was issued in june and establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains  and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  and adoption of the statement will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company must apply this statement no later than its fiscal year ending november  sfas no 
requires recording all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
this statement is not expected to materially affect the company s financial statements 
effects of changing prices the united states economy experienced considerable inflation during the late s and early s but in recent years has been fairly stable and at low levels 
the company  along with most other us business enterprises  was then and could again be adversely affected by any recurrence of such economic conditions although in general  inflation has had a minimal effect on the company 
in recent years  oil and natural gas prices have fluctuated widely so the company s results of operations and cash flow have been inordinately affected 
oil and gas prices have also been somewhat influenced by regulation by various governmental agencies  by the world economy  and by world politics 
operating expenses have been relatively stable but  when analyzed as a percentage of revenues  may be distorted because they become a larger percentage of revenues when lower product prices prevail 
drilling and equipment costs have risen noticeably in the last two years but have recently begun to drop as drilling programs have been cutback by most companies 
competition in the industry can significantly affect the cost of acquiring leases  although in the past decade competition has lessened as more operators have withdrawn from active exploration programs 
inflation  as well as a recessionary period  can cause significant swings in the interest rates the company pays on bank borrowings 
these factors are anticipated to continue to affect the company s operations  both positively and negatively  for the foreseeable future
