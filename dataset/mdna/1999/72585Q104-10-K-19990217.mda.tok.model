the company s restaurants operate under separate franchise agreements  which generally have terms between five and ten years with renewal options between five and ten years and require payment of monthly royalties equal to of restaurant sales 
the company also has entered into development agreements with pji to open a certain number of restaurants over a defined period of time within specific geographic areas 
the company s development agreements generally require it to pay a non refundable fee per restaurant covered by the respective agreements and which fee is typically credited against the initial franchise fee that the company is required to pay for each new restaurant opened 
the company amortizes development and franchise fees over a year period  beginning with the opening of a restaurant

impact of inflation the company does not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly labor  employee benefits or food costs  could have a significant impact on the company in the future 
impact of year some of the company s older purchased software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  time sensitive software or hardware recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations resulting in disruptions of important administrative processes  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment of its computer systems and will have to modify or replace certain software and hardware so that they will function properly in the year and thereafter 
based on the company s assessment or representations from software suppliers  or both  the company believes the total year project cost will be less than  and costs incurred to date have been less than  much of the cost related to year coincides with existing management plans to replace certain systems principally the financial accounting system in order to accommodate the company s planned growth 
the company expects the new accounting system to be implemented by june the timing of implementation was not materially affected by year concerns 
the company believes that with the planned modifications to existing software and or conversions to new software and hardware as described above  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on certain administrative processes  but would not be expected to have a material impact on restaurant operating processes 
the company s payroll system interfaces directly with a significant third party vendor 
the company has completed the testing and implementation of the year compliant software utilized to interface directly with this third party vendor 
the company is in the process of querying its significant vendors with respect to year issues 
based on the responses received from vendors  the company is not aware of any vendors with a year issue that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that vendors will be year ready 
the inability of vendors to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company  although the actual impact of non compliance by vendors is not determinable 
the company has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of its year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in june to determine whether such contingency plans are necessary  although at this time the company knows of no reason its year program will not be completed in a timely manner
