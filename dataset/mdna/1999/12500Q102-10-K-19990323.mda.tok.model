item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
this form k contains certain statements that may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result  among other factors  of changes in general  national or regional economic conditions  changes in loan default and charge off rates  reductions in deposit levels necessitating increased borrowing to fund loans and investments  changes in interest rates  and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included within this report

additional funds were raised from increased borrowings 
borrowings from the federal home loan bank were  higher on average  an increase of  as the bank continued to take long term advances to offset the interest rate risk of fixed rate commercial mortgage lending and increased the level of its short term borrowing for the purpose of making high quality investments with short effective duration 
through these efforts  management is attempting to increase earnings without incurring significant additional risk 
other short term borrowings were higher by  on average  an increase of 
at year end  total loans were  higher than a year earlier  an increase of 
on average for the year  they were  higher  an increase of 
increases in some loan categories were partially offset by declines in others

net interest income 
interest rates declined during  which decreased the yields on the bank s loans and investments 
the cost of the bank s deposits and borrowings also decreased  but by a smaller amount 
because of the positive spread between the return on earning assets and the cost of funds  the bank s net interest income increased as a result of the overall growth in deposits  borrowings  loans and investments discussed above

maturity structure of assets and liabilities and sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  fixed rate debt securities and loans mature as follows fixed rate debt securities loans dollar amounts in thousands remaining maturity three months or less   over three months through months   over one year through five years   over five years   totals   included in fixed rate debt securities are  of collateralized mortgage obligations 
these have been distributed based on estimates of their principal cash flows rather than their contractual final maturities 
included in three months or less of loans are  of customer account overdrafts that the bank reclassified as loans 
the remaining maturity of time certificates of deposit as of december  was as follows fixed rate certificates of deposit  or more less than  dollar amounts in thousands remaining maturity three months or less   over three months through months   over one year through two years   over two years through three years  over three years through four years over four years through five years over five years totals   other deposits may be withdrawn by the customer without notice or penalty 
the rates paid thereon are reviewed each month and changed at the bank s option as often as indicated by changing market conditions 
the remaining maturity of borrowings from the federal home loan bank as of december  was as follows fixed rate fhlb borrowings dollar amounts in thousands remaining maturity three months or less  over three months through months  over one year through five years  over five years  totals  rates paid on other interest bearing liabilities change daily 
as of december   floating rate debt securities  fhlb stock and loans reprice as follows floating rate debt securities fhlb stock loans dollar amounts in thousands repricing frequency quarterly or more frequently    annually or more frequently  but less frequently than quarterly   every five years or more frequently  but less frequently than annually  less frequently than every five years 
 totals    floating rate fhlb borrowings dollar amounts in thousands repricing frequency quarterly or more frequently  annually or more frequently  but less frequently than quarterly every five years or more frequently  but less frequently than annually less frequently than every five years totals  most of the bank s residential mortgage loans are adjustable rate mortgages subject to interest rate caps 
the bank s investment securities are subject to market risk in the following ways 
 of the investment securities owned as of december  are floating rate instruments tied to various indices  primarily the month treasury bill and libor 
lesser amounts are tied to longer term treasury rates and other indices 
almost all of these floating rate instruments are subject to interest rate caps which range from to 
if interest rates rise enough so that there is a significant possibility that a given security will become subject to its interest rate cap  the market value of that security will be reduced 
this risk is greater to the extent that the remaining life of the investment is longer 
the bank s floating rate investments have an average life of about two years 
market risk may also result from the fact that various indices will not always move by the same amount when interest rates increase 
this may cause securities tied to one index to perform less well than securities tied to other indices 
most of the remaining  of securities are fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations 
fixed rate investments have market risk because their rate of return does not change at all with the general level of interest rates 
an additional characteristic of cmos is that their principal payments tend to slow when interest rates rise 
if the fixed rate earned on the investment is lower than the new market rate  this can result in a decline in the value of these securities 
almost all of the bank s fixed rate cmos have very short lives and have interest rates above current market levels  which reduces the market risk of these securities 
the average life of the bank s fixed rate investments is less than one year 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses is an estimate of the amount necessary to provide an adequate reserve to absorb probable losses in current loan portfolio 
this amount is determined by management based on a regular evaluation of the loan portfolio and considers such factors as loan loss experience and current economic conditions 
the reserve is an estimate  and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates 
as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings of the periods in which they become known 
some assumptions must be made in order to estimate the extent of losses likely to result from loans in the current portfolio 
although the local economy has been strong in recent years  the national economy may eventually enter into a recession after a long period of expansion 
this could result in a decline in tourism on cape cod negatively affecting the bank s borrowers and resulting in higher losses to the bank 
the bank has experienced increased delinquency and charge off rates in its consumer loan portfolio 
a downturn in the local economy could adversely affect the ability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans 
the bank has also purchased packages of residential mortgage loans which contain loans on properties outside of the bank s market area which may be subject to their own economic risks 
these factors could result in greater losses than are currently expected  in which case  greater provisions for loan losses may prove to be necessary in future periods 
on the other hand  if these factors do not result in significant deterioration to the quality of the loan portfolio  actual losses may be less than the reserve and the excess amount will be recovered by credits to income in future periods 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the bank s reserve for loan losses as part of their examination process 
such agencies may require the bank to make additions to the reserve based upon judgements different from those of management 
non performing assets and loan loss experience non performing assets as of december   and were as follows dollar amounts in thousands nonaccrual loans    loans past due days or more and still accruing property from defaulted loans total non performing assets    restructured troubled debt performing in accordance with amended terms  not included above   accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when it is questionable whether the borrower will be able to pay principal and interest in full and or when loan payments are days past due unless the loan is fully secured by real estate or other collateral held by the bank 
accordingly  for loans which are shown as past due days or more and still accruing  management expects that principal and interest will be repaid in full 
in some instances  the bank may also be repaid in full on nonaccrual loans 
loans are classified substandard when they are not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the debtor or of the collateral 
at december    of loans were included in this category  in addition to loans reported above 
the bank s loan classification system also includes a category for loans which are monitored for possible deterioration in credit quality 
at december    of loans were included in this category 
however  it is probable that there will be losses on other loans which have not been specifically identified 
the changes in the reserve for loan losses during the three years ended december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands balance  beginning of year    provision for loan losses charge offs commercial loans construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans consumer loans recoveries on loans previously charged off commercial loans construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans consumer loans balance  end of year    dollar amounts in thousands allocation of ending balance commercial loans    construction mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans    industrial revenue bonds residential mortgage loans    consumer loans  balance  end of year    ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding recoveries on loans previously charged off exceeded charge offs and management determined that additions to the reserve for possible loan losses were unnecessary in  notwithstanding the growth in the loan portfolio 
management believes that the reserve is adequate to cover the losses likely to result from loans in the current loan portfolio 
liquidity the bank normally experiences a wide swing in its liquidity each year as a result of the seasonal nature of the economy in its market area 
liquidity is usually at its high in late summer and early fall and the annual low point is usually in the spring 
substantially all of the amount shown as cash and due from banks at year end was made up of checks and similar items in the process of collection or was needed to satisfy a requirement to maintain a portion of the bank s deposits in an account at the federal reserve 
accordingly  it does not represent a source of liquidity for the bank 
in general  the bank s investment securities could also be easily sold if necessary to meet liquidity needs 
in that event  a gain or loss would be realized if the market value of the securities sold was not equal to their cost  adjusted for the amortization of premium or accretion of discount 
the bank can also borrow funds using investment securities as collateral 
the bank has a line of credit of  from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the bank has also established a line of credit for the purchase of federal funds from a regional bank and may borrow from the federal reserve if necessary 
computer processing in the year the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of much computer software has been written which allows the year in a date to be recognized and or stored based on a two digit number  ie  might be recognized as meaning december  the same is true of a variety of hardware devices with built in clock calendars  such as computers 
in some cases  this could create problems at the turn of the century when could  in some cases  be interpreted to mean january  rather than january  if such circumstances are not identified and corrected in advance  they could cause system failure or erroneous calculations of such items as interest income or expense 
this could potentially have a significant impact on the bank s ability to do business 
for the bank s internal computer processing  it was determined that it was necessary to replace some of its personal computers and to acquire more recent versions of certain software 
 was spent for this purpose in and an additional  is expected to be spent in these costs will be capitalized and depreciated over the useful lives of the items purchased 
the bank relies on outside vendors for much of its critical data processing 
these vendors have assured the bank that they are year compliant 
the bank s testing has confirmed this  but testing is not yet complete 
approximately one half of those systems that the bank considers to be critical or high risk have not yet been tested at december  the remaining testing is expected to be completed by march  contingency plans are being developed for processing of the bank s work in the event of the failure of any of these systems 
the bank is also dependent on other providers for the conduct of its business  most notably for electrical power and telecommunications 
these providers could possibly be subject to year problems which disrupted their services 
prolonged outages in these services could seriously affect the bank s ability to conduct business as usual 
certain customers of the bank may be subject to year problems which affect their ability to do business 
among other things  this could result in reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their loans to the bank 
year risk still needs to be evaluated for approximately one half of the bank s significant customer relationships 
other customers may withdraw funds from the bank in anticipation of possible year disruptions 
the bank has lengthened the maturities of certain of its borrowings and expects to continue to maintain a very short investment portfolio to meet any deposit outflows 
it is anticipated that maturities in the investment portfolio will be far in excess of any such withdrawals  but the bank may lose the ability to earn on these amounts for the period of time that they are out of the bank 
please refer to the statement regarding forward looking information at the beginning of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with regard to any forward looking statements in this section 
although the bank and bancorp believe that they are responding appropriately to the year issue  please note that neither the bank nor bancorp can guarantee their year readiness nor that of material vendors and customers or the effectiveness of their contingency plans in the event of a failure in any of the bank s computing systems 
distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  average interest rates and interest spread the average amount outstanding for certain categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest income or expense and the average yields earned or rates paid thereon  are summarized in the following table for the three years ended december  nonaccrual loan balances have been included in their respective loan categories which reduces the calculated yields 
a portion of the income reported in certain of the asset categories is not subject to federal income tax  making it relatively more valuable 
the computed yields shown have not been adjusted for taxable equivalency

these amounts were calculated directly from the amounts included in the preceding table 
the amount allocated to change in volume was calculated by multiplying the change in volume by the average of the interest rates earned or paid in the two periods 
the amount allocated to change in rate was calculated by multiplying the change in rate by the average volume over the two periods 
in lower interest rates reduced interest income by more than the decrease in interest expense because the bank has more interest earning assets and because sharply lower treasury rates reduced the yields on loans and investments 
higher interest rates in increased the yields on investment securities but loan yields decreased and the bank was less aggressive in gaining deposit market share

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices 
in particular  the market prices of interest earning assets may be affected by changes in interest rates 
since net interest income the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is the bank s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the bank is exposed 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of the bank s assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the bank s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
in addition to directly impacting net interest income  changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and refinancings  the carrying value of investment securities classified as available for sale and the flow and mix of deposits 
the bank s asset liability management committee  comprised of senior management and several directors  is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
the committee meets monthly and sets the rates paid on deposits  approves loan pricing and reviews investment transactions 
the bank is subject to interest rate risk in the event that rates either increase or decrease 
in the event that interest rates increase the value of the net assets of the bank the liquidation value of stockholders equity would decline 
at december  it is estimated that an increase in interest rates of basis points for example  an increase in the prime rate from to would reduce the value of the net assets of the bank by  on the other hand  if interest rates were to decrease  the value of the net assets of the bank would increase 
although the value of the net assets of the bank is subject to risk if interest rates rise but not if rates fall the opposite is true of the bank s earnings 
if interest rates were to increase the net interest income of the bank would increase because the bank has more interest earning assets than it has interest bearing liabilities and much of this excess amount reprices within a short period of time 
as a result  the bank s net interest income is instead subject to a risk of a decline in rates 
not only are there fewer interest bearing liabilities to reprice  but many of these liabilities could not reprice much lower because the rates paid on them are already low 
accordingly  if interest rates were to decrease by basis points for example  a decrease in the prime rate from to it is estimated that the net interest income of the bank would decrease by  on the other hand  if interest rates were to increase the net interest income of the bank would increase
