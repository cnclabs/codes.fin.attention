this is discussed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this form k 
future outlook the company encountered a difficult set of challenges in large negative currency effects  economic contractions in many international markets  and softness in a few key us markets 
to improve productivity and reduce costs  the company is exiting certain product lines  consolidating manufacturing operations  and eliminating lower value activities in corporate service functions 
relating to these actions  the company recorded a restructuring charge in this charge is discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company is divesting certain businesses  primarily in its health care segment  as part of its restructuring plan 
these businesses have annual revenues of about million and marginal operating income 
potential gains from divesting these businesses with a decreasing strategic fit are not expected to be material and will be recognized when realized as part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company experienced a net reduction of about  positions in the second half of  with a total net reduction of about  positions expected by december  each business segment and geographic area of the company will be affected by this restructuring plan 
the company expects to eliminate about  positions in the united states   in europe  in the asia pacific area  and in the company s latin america  africa  and canada geographic area 
when fully implemented by the end of  the restructuring plan is expected to provide annual pre tax savings of about million 
the company anticipates implementation costs associated with this restructuring plan to be about million in these costs  not included in the restructuring charge  include expenses for relocating employees  inventory and equipment  unfavorable overhead variances  and other expenses 
if the company does not generate adequate sales growth  normal increases in salaries and wages and additional depreciation from capital expenditures will create offsets to the annual savings 
m expects sales growth in of to percent in local currencies 
sales are expected to grow to percent in the united states 
internationally  the company is expecting to increase sales in local currencies to percent 
volume growth is anticipated to be about percent in europe  percent in the asia pacific area and to percent in japan 
in asia outside japan  volume growth is expected to resume in in latin america  it is difficult to predict ramifications of the brazilian currency devaluation  and therefore the company is not expecting any contribution to earnings growth from latin america 
the company is not able to project what the consequences will be from the turmoil in various economies around the world 
the company is monitoring business conditions closely and is prepared to make adjustments in costs  pricing and investments as appropriate 
the company expects to resume earnings growth in  driven by volume growth  new products  greater productivity gains and tight expense controls 
based on exchange rates as of february   the company believes that currency effects will have a minimal impact on sales and earnings in capital spending totaled billion in  and is expected to be about percent lower in the company does not expect a significant change in its tax rate in year readiness the year issue is the result of using only the last two digits to indicate the year in computer hardware and software programs and embedded technology such as micro controllers 
as a result  these programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if uncorrected  such programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause computer system failure or other errors disrupting normal business operations 
the company recognizes the importance of readiness for the year and has given it high priority 
in november  the company created a corporate wide year project team representing all company business and staff units 
the team s objective is to ensure an uninterrupted transition to the year by assessing  testing and modifying it and non it systems defined below and date sensitive company products so that a they will perform as intended  regardless of the date before  during and after december   and b dates before  during and after december  and including february  can be processed with expected results year compliant 
the scope of the year compliance effort includes i information technology it such as software and hardware  ii non it systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various manufacturing and laboratory equipment  environmental and safety systems  facilities and utilities  iii date sensitive company products  and iv the readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers  and the electronic data interchange edi with those key third parties 
the year project team has taken an inventory of it and non it systems and date sensitive company products that might malfunction or fail as a result of using only the last two digits to indicate the year 
the project teams then categorized the potential date component failures into three categories vital stops the business operation and no short term solution is available  critical inconvenient to the business operation and a short term solution is available  and marginal inconsequential to the business operation 
it systems the company is using both internal and external resources to remediate and test millions of lines of application software code 
as of december   approximately percent of the core it systems eg  general ledger  payroll  procurement and order management located in the united states that are deemed vital or critical are year compliant 
as of december   approximately percent of the it systems in subsidiaries outside the united states that are deemed vital or critical are year compliant 
non it systems the company has more than manufacturing and laboratory locations worldwide with varying degrees of non it systems such as programmable logic controllers  gauging guidance and adjustment systems and testing equipment 
assessment and testing of non it systems for year compliance has proven much more difficult than assessing compliance of it systems because testing of non it systems often requires shutdown of the manufacturing operations 
as a result  the company has approached assessment and testing of non it systems that are common to many of the company s facilities by i contacting the suppliers of these non it systems and obtaining statements that the systems are year compliant  and ii testing components of non it systems when they are shut down for normal maintenance 
the company has also shut down manufacturing lines in three of its facilities and tested non it systems that are common to many of the company s facilities 
these tests demonstrate that time intervals instead of dates are used almost exclusively in these non it systems and support the company s belief that potential disruptions of such systems due to the year issue should be minimal 
as of december   approximately percent of the non it systems located in the united states that are deemed vital or critical and approximately percent of the non it systems in subsidiaries outside the united states that are deemed vital or critical are believed to be year compliant 
company products the vast majority of the company s products are not date sensitive 
the company has collected information on current and discontinued date sensitive products 
this information is available to customers as of the date of this filing 
third parties in addition to internal year it and non it remediation activities  the company is in contact with key suppliers and electronic commerce customers to minimize potential disruptions in the relationships between the company and these important third parties related to the year issue 
the company has also categorized supplies purchased from vendors into three categories vital disruption of supply stops the business operation and no short term solution is available  critical disruption of supply is inconvenient to the business operation and a short term solution is available  and marginal disruption of supply is inconsequential to the business operation 
the company has focused its efforts on those vendors that supply goods or services deemed vital to the company s business 
while the company cannot guarantee compliance by third parties  the company is developing contingency plans with its key suppliers that includes the availability of appropriate inventories of supplies in the event the supplier is not year compliant 
contingency planning the company is preparing contingency plans specifying what the company will do if failures occur in it and non it systems  or important third parties are not year compliant 
the company expects to finalize contingency plans by march   for its it and non it systems  and by april   for its key suppliers 
costs through december   the company had spent million out of a total estimate of approximately million related to year readiness issue 
these costs include the costs incurred for external consultants and professional advisors and the costs for software and hardware 
the company s process for tracking internal costs does not capture all of the costs incurred for each of the teams working on the year project 
such internal costs are principally the related payroll costs for its information systems group and other employees working on the year project 
the company is expensing as incurred all costs related to the assessment and remediation of the year issue 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
the company s current estimates of the time and costs necessary to remediate and test its computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
the estimates were made using assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  such as skilled it personnel and electrical power  year modification plans  implementation success by key third parties  and other factors 
new developments could affect the company s estimates of the amount of time and costs needed to modify and test its it and non it systems for year compliance 
these developments include  but are not limited to i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to locate and correct all relevant date sensitive code in both it and non it systems  iii unanticipated failures in it and non it systems  and iv the planning and year compliance success that key customers and suppliers attain 
the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on the current estimate of probable costs of making its products and it and non it systems year compliant 
accordingly  the company is not able to estimate possible future costs beyond the current estimates 
as new developments occur  these cost estimates may be revised to reflect the impact of these developments on the costs to the company of making its products and it and non it systems year compliant 
such cost revisions could have a material adverse impact on the company s net income in the quarterly period in which they are recorded 
although the company considers it unlikely  such revisions could also have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or annual results of operations of the company 
the euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union eu established fixed conversion rates through the european central bank ecb between existing local currencies and the euro  the eu s new single currency 
the participating countries had agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
from that date  the euro is traded on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
following introduction of the euro  local currencies will remain legal tender until december  during this transition period  goods and services may be paid for with the euro or the local currency under the eu s no compulsion  no prohibition principle 
if cross border payments are made in a local currency during this transition period  the amount will be converted into euros and then converted from euros into the second local currency at rates fixed by the ecb 
by no later than december   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
by no later than july   participating countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in local currencies  making the euro conversion complete 
in february  the company created a european monetary union emu steering committee and project teams representing all company business and staff units in europe 
the common objective of these teams is to ensure a smooth transition to emu for the company and its constituencies 
the scope of the teams efforts includes i assessing the euro s impact on the company s business and pricing strategies for customers and suppliers  and ii ensuring that the company s business processes and information technology it systems can process transactions in euros and local currencies during the transition period and achieve the conversion of all relevant local currency data to the euro by december   in the participating countries 
europe is a significant market for the company  contributing of consolidated sales and of consolidated operating income in excluding the restructuring charge 
the company believes that the euro will  over time  increase price competition for the company s products across europe due to cross border price transparency 
the company also believes that the adverse effects of increased price competition will be offset somewhat by new business opportunities and efficiencies in what is the world s second largest economy 
the company  however  is not able to estimate the anticipated net long term impact of the euro introduction on the company 
the company has consolidated it operations and made significant investments in it systems in europe in anticipation of the emu 
the company expects that these investments will enable the company to manage customer orders  invoices  payments and accounts in euros and in local currencies according to customer needs during the three year transition period 
during this period  the company anticipates spending approximately million to complete the conversion to the euro 
because the company believes its it systems will be ready by december  for the euro conversion  it has not developed contingency plans at this time 
the euro introduction is not expected to have a material impact on the company s overall currency risk 
although the company engages in significant trade within the eu  the impact to date of changes in currency exchange rates on trade within the eu has not been material 
the company anticipates the euro will simplify financial issues related to cross border trade in the eu and reduce the transaction costs and administrative time necessary to manage this trade and related risks 
the company believes that the associated savings will not be material to corporate results 
the company has derivatives outstanding beyond january   in several european currencies 
under the eu s no compulsion  no prohibition principle  the outstanding derivative positions will either mature as local currency contracts or convert to euro contracts at no additional economic cost to the company 
the company believes that systems used to monitor derivative positions can be appropriately modified for these changes 
the company believes the impact of the euro introduction on the company s derivative positions will not be material
