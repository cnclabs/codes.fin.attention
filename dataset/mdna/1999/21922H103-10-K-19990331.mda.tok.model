the company has adjusted and ffo by the net gain on interest rate swaps due to the non cash nature of these items 
industry analysts generally consider ffo to be an appropriate measure of performance of a reit such as cornerstone 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and  therefore  should not be considered a substitute for net income as a measure of performance or a substitute for cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity calculated in accordance with gaap 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the company to generate earnings from its recurring operations  after the payment of all administrative costs and interest expense 
for cash flows from operating  financing  and investing activities in accordance with gaap see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements which are part of this report

year compliance general the year compliance issue concerns the inability of computerized information systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after december  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
management recognizes the importance of ensuring that its business and operational systems are not disrupted as a result of year issues 
readiness cornerstone properties inc has created a year task force to evaluate and take the appropriate actions regarding year compliance 
the company s plan is divided into three major sections i compliance of information systems at the corporate offices in new york and atlanta home office  ii compliance of information and real estate operating systems at the corporate offices in california and the wilson projects wilson  and iii assessment of compliance of significant service providers including third party managers and the buildings they manage  vendors and customers external agents 
the plan covers the following major tasks i inventory of all systems  ii analysis of inventory including assessment of risk  iii verification of compliance of inventory with vendors  iv testing of critical equipment and processes  and v replacement or modification of systems 
the first section of the plan  home office  is complete 
the wilson and external agents sections of the plan are proceeding according to schedule with expected completions before december  the plan also includes questionnaires that will be sent to tenants in order to attempt to determine the effect of year on their businesses and ultimately the company s income stream 
cost the total historical and anticipated remaining costs for the year remediation are estimated to be immaterial to the company s financial condition 
the costs to date consist of recurring systems upgrades and replacements  immaterial internal staff costs and other expenses such as telephone and mailing costs 
the information and real estate operating systems that have thus far been identified as non compliant are at or approaching the end of their useful lives and have been or will be replaced or upgraded as a part of the normal operations of the company 
risks and contingency plans the company does not anticipate significant delays in finalizing the first two sections of its year remediation plan 
however  external agents having a material relationship with the company eg  property managers  utilities  financial institutions  governmental agencies  municipalities and major tenants may be a potential risk based on their individual year preparedness  which may not be within the company s reasonable control 
the company is in the process of identifying  reviewing and logging the year preparedness of critical external agents 
while the company is not aware of any matters with regard to its major tenants which could give rise to a material default  there may be a potential risk with regard to their year preparedness which may be outside the company s reasonable control 
the company is currently in the process of surveying its tenants to try to predetermine the risk of defaults due to year issues 
currently  there has been no indication or expectation of material risks in the compliance of the first two sections of the plan 
pending unfavorable results  the company will determine what course of action and contingencies will need to be made 
there can be no assurance that external year issues will be resolved 
noncompliance of external agents as well as the company s major tenants could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition

development project on april   the company entered into an agreement to purchase a  square foot class a office building  currently under development  in downtown minneapolis  minnesota 
approximately million has been spent as of december  on the construction 
the project is scheduled to be completed in the year and is approximately pre leased 
the development is being financed through a construction loan by us bank

subsequent events on january   in connection with the wilson acquisition  the company prepaid the notes on two adp plaza and two corporate centre 
the balances of the two loans at the time of prepayment were million and million  respectively

a cash dividend and unitholder distribution of per share unit was declared for the first half of the fourth quarter of and paid on february   to common stockholders and unitholders of record as of december  a cash dividend and unitholder distribution of per share unit was declared for the second half of the fourth quarter of and paid on february   to common stockholders and unitholders of record as of january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding 
the company does not believe that the interest rate risk represented by its floating rate debt is material as of that date in relation to the approximately billion of total debt outstanding and approximately billion market capitalization of the company 
the company was not a party to any hedging agreements with respect to its variable rate debt as of december  the company will consider entering into hedging agreements with respect to all or a portion of its floating rate debt and during january entered into four hedging agreements with major financial institutions for a total amount of approximately million 
although hedging agreements would enable the company to convert variable rate liabilities to fixed rate liabilities  they would expose the company to the risk that the counterparties to such hedge agreements may not perform  which could increase the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  however  the counterparties to hedging agreements that the company would enter into would be major financial institutions 
the company may borrow additional money with variable rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or loss of benefits of any hedging agreements that the company may enter into in the future  would increase the company s interest expense  which could affect cash flow and the ability of the company to service its debt 
if the company enters into any hedging agreements in the future  decreases in interest rates thereafter would increase the company s interest expense as compared to the underlying variable rate debt and could result in the company making payments to unwind such agreements
