item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed below under the headings recent developments  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors  including those identified below in outlook issues and uncertainties  may affect our actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those in any forward looking statement 
our products and services are grouped into three general business sectors space and ground infrastructure systems  satellite access products and satellite services 
space and ground infrastructure systems include launch vehicles  satellites and related space systems  electronics and sensor systems  and satellite ground systems and software 
satellite access products include satellite based navigation  positioning and communications products and transportation management systems 
satellite services include satellite based two way mobile data communications services  satellite based remote imaging services  our new orbnav initiative relating to satellite based automotive information services and satellite based voice communications services provided by orbcomm and orbimage and to be provided by orbnav and cci  respectively 
we are accounting for our investments in orbcomm  orbimage and cci using the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognize as equity in earnings losses of affiliates our proportionate share of orbcomm s and orbimage s profits and losses 
in accordance with a modified equity method of accounting  we currently recognize as equity in earnings losses of affiliates of cci s profits and losses 
we also recognize of the revenues earned and costs incurred on sales of products and services to these entities 
however  as these companies are currently capitalizing substantially all system construction costs  including amounts paid to orbital  we eliminate as equity in earnings losses of affiliates our proportionate share of our profits and losses from sales to orbcomm  orbimage and cci  respectively 
recent developments in april  we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share  generating net proceeds of approximately in july  our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol orb 
our stock had previously traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol orbi 
in august  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with cci pursuant to which we agreed  subject to the satisfaction by cci of certain milestones and conditions  to purchase up to  of cci s non voting convertible preferred shares  with an option to purchase an additional  of preferred shares  and to provide vendor financing 
in connection with the execution of the stock purchase agreement  we entered into a satellite and launch vehicle procurement contract with cci valued at approximately  for the satellites and a price to be determined for the launch vehicles in the event we procure them 
as of december   we had purchased  of the preferred shares and had not provided any vendor financing 
should cci not achieve its financial or operational milestones  some of which entail raising capital  or if an adequate market for its products and services should not develop  we may be required to write off all  or a portion  of this investment 
in october  we adopted a stockholder rights plan in which preferred stock purchase rights were granted as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common stock to stockholders of record on november  the plan is designed to deter coercive or unfair takeover tactics 
the rights become exercisable only if a person or group in the future becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our common stock  or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in its ownership of or more of our common stock 
each right  when exercisable  entitles the holder to purchase one one thousandth of a share of series b junior participating preferred stock 
under certain circumstances  each holder of a right will be able to exercise the right and receive common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price 
the rights are generally redeemable by our board of directors at a redemption price of per right and expire on october  on december   we acquired the transportation systems business of raytheon company for approximately  in cash 
we merged the acquired business into our existing transportation management systems business 
results of operations the following table shows our revenues  gross profits and gross margins by major product category within each business sector for each of the years ended december   and gross gross gross revenues profits margin revenues profits margin revenues profits margin dollars in thousands space and ground infrastructure systems       launch vehicles       satellites       electronics and sensor systems       satellite ground systems and software       satellite access products       satellite services n a n a   n a consolidated totals       revenues our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
space and ground infrastructure systems 
revenues from our space and ground infrastructure systems sector increased to  in  from  in and  in revenues from our launch vehicles increased to  in  from  in and  in the increase in revenues in and was attributable to a number of factors  including increased work performed under contracts received for our taurus launch vehicle  a significant increase in new orders for our pegasus and suborbital launch vehicles and increased work performed on the x reusable launch vehicle 
revenues from sales of satellites increased to  in  from  in and  in satellite revenues remained generally consistent from to as work on several programs were completed concurrent with the receipt of new satellite orders 
the substantial increase in satellite revenues was primarily due to new satellite orders received in the second half of and in revenues in and also included approximately  and  respectively  of sales generated by the satellite contracts we acquired from cta in august revenues from electronics and sensor systems increased to  in  from  in and  in the increase in and revenues was primarily attributable to work performed on new orders for defense electronics products received during and early revenues from satellite ground systems and software products increased to  in  from  in and  in the increase in revenues is primarily due to work performed on orders received in and  including work on a new remote imaging system 
the decrease in revenues from revenues was primarily due to the sale in late of a software related business that had generated revenues of approximately orbital s space and ground infrastructure systems sector revenues included sales to orbcomm of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  and to orbimage of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
this sector s revenues also included  from sales to cci in none in earlier years 
we expect sales to our satellite services affiliates to be less than those recorded in primarily because the basic orbcomm satellite construction and launch program is nearing completion 
satellite access products 
revenues from sales of consumer  high precision and automotive satellite based positioning and navigation products  satellite communications products and transportation management systems increased to  in  from  in and  in revenues in included approximately  of sales generated by our high precision navigation products that were acquired as a result of the december merger of ashtech with our magellan subsidiary 
although revenues from satellite access products were greater than revenues  revenues were below our expectations due to increased competition in consumer products and slower sales of automotive navigation products 
gross profit costs of goods sold costs of goods sold include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead related to commercial products and under various development and production contracts 
gross profit depends on a number of factors  including our mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to estimated costs 
our consolidated gross profit for  and was  of revenues   of revenues and  of revenues  respectively 
space and ground infrastructure systems 
gross profit from our space and ground infrastructure systems sector was  of sector revenues   of sector revenues and  of sector revenues for  and  respectively 
gross profit margins from our space and ground infrastructure systems sector for were generally consistent with margins 
gross profit margins were slightly higher in due to the inclusion of higher margins from a software related business that was part of our ground systems business and was sold in late gross profit margins in this sector are impacted by management s periodic assessments and reevaluations of programmatic risks included in estimated costs to complete long term contracts 
satellite access products 
gross profit from our satellite access products sector was  of sector revenues   of sector revenues and  of sector revenues for  and  respectively 
the overall increase in gross profit margins when compared to margins is due to the inclusion of higher margin  high precision positioning and navigation product lines acquired from ashtech offset  in part  by lower margins achieved on other consumer and automotive navigation product sales 
the decrease in gross profit margins from to was due to lower unit sales prices for consumer products and certain fourth quarter reorganizational charges incurred by magellan 
during  magellan disposed of approximately  of obsolete inventory that was offset  in part  by previously established inventory obsolescence reserves 
magellan continues to face increased competition  which places significant pressure on individual product lifetimes and inventory levels 
gross profit in was reduced by approximately  of increased inventory obsolescence reserves 
research and development expenses research and development expenses represent our self funded product development activities and exclude direct customer funded development 
research and development expenses during  and were  of revenues   of revenues and  of revenues  respectively 
research and development spending during these periods related primarily to the development of new or improved satellite access products  improved launch vehicles  and new satellite initiatives 
research and development expenses in also included approximately  of costs related to identifying and resolving certain technical issues arising on orbcomm data communications satellites 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of marketing  advertising  promotion and other selling expenses  as well as the costs of the finance  legal  administrative and general management functions of orbital 
selling  general and administrative expenses for  and were  of revenues   of revenues and  of revenues  respectively 
while selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was consistent from to  the total amount of selling  general and administrative costs increased substantially  primarily as a result of growth in our space and ground infrastructure systems sector and the impact of various business and product line acquisitions 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in from was primarily attributable to significant growth in space and ground infrastructure systems revenues  along with only modest growth in selling  general and administrative expenses attributable to those product lines 
net investment income expense net investment income expense was   and  for  and  respectively 
investment income reflected interest earnings on short term investments and realized gains and losses on investments  reduced by interest expense on outstanding debt of   and  in  and  respectively 
interest expense was net of capitalized interest of approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates and non controlling interests in earnings losses of consolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings losses of affiliates and non controlling interests in earnings losses of consolidated subsidiaries were   and  for  and  respectively 
these amounts primarily represent i elimination of proportionate profits or losses on sales of infrastructure products to orbcomm  orbimage and cci  ii our proportionate share of orbcomm s  orbcomm international partners  lp s and orbimage s earnings and losses for  iii of cci s earnings and losses for  and iv non controlling stockholders proportionate share of orbcomm usa  lp s and magellan s current period earnings and losses 
the increases in and were primarily due to increased operational and system depreciation expenses and resulting losses at orbcomm 
we expect equity in earnings losses of affiliates to increase in primarily due to increased losses at orbcomm 
gain on sale of subsidiary equity we recorded a gain on sale of subsidiary equity of  and  in and  respectively 
the gain related to the issuance of additional equity by our orbimage affiliate 
the gain related to the issuance of additional equity by our magellan subsidiary 
provision for income taxes we recorded consolidated income tax provisions of   and  for  and  respectively 
our provisions for these periods were entirely due to foreign taxes attributable to our canadian operations 
at december   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards portions of which expire beginning in of approximately  us research and experimental income tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and foreign investment income tax credit carryforwards subject to expiration in of approximately  such net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits are subject to certain limitations and other restrictions 
at december  and  we provided a valuation reserve of  and  respectively  against certain of our consolidated deferred tax assets 
net income loss our consolidated net income loss for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
our space and ground infrastructure systems sector generated net income of approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
our satellite access products sector reported net losses of  for  as compared to net income of  in and  in our satellite services sector generated net losses of   and  in  and  respectively  and such losses are expected to increase in primarily as a result of increased losses at orbcomm 
during  our satellite access products sector continued to face increased competition in consumer products and slower sales of automotive navigation products  placing pressure on revenues and margins 
magellan has introduced new products and is implementing cost savings measures intended to moderate the unfavorable trends experienced in in this sector 
in addition  this sector incurred significant costs in associated with the integration and restructuring of ashtech and magellan and research and development with respect to new products and enhancements of existing products 
net income for included a  gain on the issuance of magellan stock 
liquidity and capital resources our growth has required substantial capital to fund expanding working capital needs  investments in affiliates  certain business acquisitions  new business initiatives  research and development and capital expenditures 
we have funded these requirements to date  and expect to fund our future requirements  through cash generated by operations  working capital  loan facilities  asset based financings  joint venture arrangements and private and public equity and debt offerings 
we expect to continue to pursue potential acquisitions  new business opportunities and equity investments that we believe would enhance our businesses and to fund such transactions through existing cash  loan facilities  joint ventures  the issuance of equity and or debt securities  asset based financings  and cash generated by operations 
at december   cash and investments were  and we had total debt obligations outstanding of approximately  the outstanding debt is comprised of our  convertible subordinated notes  advances under our line of credit facilities  secured and unsecured notes  and asset based financings 
cash and investments at december  included approximately  of cash and short term investments restricted against outstanding letters of credit 
our current ratio was at december  and in  we amended and restated our primary credit facility to increase the maximum amount available under a revolving line of credit from  to  and to modify certain financial covenants 
at december    was outstanding on the facility 
during the first quarter of  the facility was amended to modify a financial covenant to provide full availability under the facility 
the interest rate charged under the facility is a variable rate based on the prime rate or libor 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  was 
the facility is secured by accounts receivable  prohibits the payment of cash dividends  contains certain covenants with respect to our working capital levels  fixed charges ratio  leverage ratio and net worth  and expires in december during  we provided  in capital to orbcomm 
we currently estimate that our share of additional funding for orbcomm s capital needs could exceed  of which  has been contributed so far in we expect to fund our share of orbcomm s capital needs through existing resources  including our primary credit facility 
in addition  during  orbital deferred invoicing orbcomm for approximately  of work performed under our orbcomm satellite and launch procurement agreement 
during  we may defer up to  of invoicing for work done under our orbcomm procurement agreement 
one half of the deferred invoice amounts has been  and is expected to continue to be  advanced to orbital by an affiliate of teleglobe inc our operations provided net cash of approximately  during also during  in addition to our investment in orbcomm  we invested approximately i  in cci  ii  in capital expenditures for various satellite and launch vehicle production  manufacturing and test equipment and office equipment  and iii  in business acquisitions 
in the event cci meets various operational and financial milestones  we may invest an additional  in cci over the next two years 
we are expanding our offices and satellite related engineering  manufacturing and operations facilities adjacent to our dulles  virginia headquarters 
construction is scheduled to commence in the first half of and we expect completion in to finance the majority of this expansion  orbital is pursuing various financing alternatives  including third party debt financings and a build to suit agreement 
on march   mda and toronto based spar aerospace limited signed an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which mda will acquire spar s robotics division for approximately  in cash 
the transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of approximately one half of the purchase price will be paid at closing and the balance is payable one year from closing 
we expect to fund the first installment of the purchase price through an existing credit facility  and have received a commitment from a lender to finance the second installment due in in late  we agreed to enter into an exclusive  joint venture with hertz whereby hertz will offer magellan s automotive navigation systems in its rental cars in the us  canada and europe 
the agreement  which is subject to negotiation of the joint venture documents  contemplates that we will receive a interest in the venture in exchange for a  investment to be made during and we expect that our capital needs for will be provided by working capital  cash flows from operations  existing or new credit facilities  and operating lease arrangements 
to support further business expansion  we may also consider equity and debt financings 
new accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas becomes effective june  and will require the company to disclose additional information on its hedging activities 
also in  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
initial application by the company of sop was as of january  this sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
sop also amended certain sections of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  which addresses revenue recognition on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the impact of adopting sop in was not significant 
year issues we have developed a plan to prepare for potential year issues with respect to various operational  technical and financial computer related systems 
the plan has been designed to minimize risk to orbital and its customers using a standard industry five phase approach 
the five phases are awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
we have substantially completed the awareness and assessment phases  including preparation of a comprehensive inventory of potentially affected systems 
in many cases renovation work is well underway and validation testing has begun with respect to certain critical systems 
we currently plan to achieve our overall goal of year readiness in mid the first half of will be devoted to renovating  validating and implementing our corrective action plan by reprogramming affected software when appropriate and feasible  obtaining vendor provided software upgrades when available and completely replacing affected systems when necessary 
the total costs to implement the plan  which costs include the already planned replacement of existing systems to support our overall growth  are estimated to be well less than one percent of revenues 
approximately of the estimated costs to implement the plan have been incurred to date and the remaining costs are expected to be incurred in the remainder of all costs  including the cost of internal personnel  outside consultants  system replacements and other equipment  will be expensed as incurred  except for long lived assets  which will be capitalized in accordance with our capitalization policies 
we have not postponed the implementation or upgrade of other systems as a result of focusing on the year plan 
as part of the plan  formal communication with our suppliers  customers and other service providers has been initiated 
to date  however  we have not determined whether year issues affecting key suppliers  significant customers including the us government  or critical service providers will materially impact our cash flows or operating results 
a reasonably likely worst case scenario of the year issue for orbital could include isolated performance problems with engineering  financial and administrative systems  isolated interruption of deliveries from critical suppliers  product liability or warranty issues  and the temporary inability of key customers to pay amounts due to orbital 
contingency plans are being prepared  and will be implemented if necessary  including having sufficient liquidity available to sustain a temporary interruption of cash receipts during early and the identification of alternative suppliers for critical components 
there can be no assurance that we have identified  or will identify  all year affected systems  suppliers  customers and service providers  or that our corrective action plan will be timely and successful 
outlook issues and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor  in certain circumstances  for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of orbital 
orbital and its representatives may from time to time make written or verbal forward looking statements  including statements contained in our filings with the sec and in the report to stockholders 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future  including statements relating to our sales and earnings growth  statements expressing general optimism about future operating results  statements relating to our belief about the outcome of pending litigation  and statements relating to our achievement of year readiness are forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
the forward looking statements are and will be based on management s then current views and assumptions regarding future events and operating performance 
the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from information contained in our forward looking statements most of the products we and our affiliates develop and manufacture are technologically advanced and sometimes novel systems that must function under demanding operating conditions and are subject to significant technological change and innovation 
we have occasionally experienced product failures or other operational problems 
in addition to any costs resulting from product warranties or required remedial action  product failures may result in increased costs or loss of revenues due to postponement or cancellation of subsequently scheduled operations or product deliveries 
our financial performance generally  as well as the recoverability of our investments in orbcomm  orbimage and cci and any other company in which we make a strategic investment  and investments that we make in the development of new technologies for new products or existing product enhancements  depend on several factors including  among other things  the successful and timely funding and implementation of innovative and novel technologies involving complex systems in a cost effective manner  the establishment and expansion of commercial markets and customer acceptance  competition and such entities ability to raise necessary capital 
if we conclude at any time that our investments are not recoverable  we may be required to write off part or all of such investments 
historically  we have made strategic acquisitions of businesses  and we routinely evaluate potential acquisition candidates that we believe would enhance our business 
we have also historically pursued strategic alliances through joint ventures  and we routinely evaluate similar opportunities 
such transactions commonly involve certain risks including  among others  assimilating the acquired operations  technologies and personnel and maintaining appropriate standards  controls  procedures and policies  entering markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  potentially losing key employees of acquired organizations  the diversion of management attention from other ongoing business concerns and resolving potential disputes with joint venture partners 
at december   approximately of our total firm contract backlog was derived from contracts with the us government and its agencies or from subcontracts with prime contractors to the us government 
most of our government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause 
such contract suspensions or terminations could result in unreimbursable expenses or charges or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the accuracy and appropriateness of our direct and indirect costs and expenses under our contracts with the us government are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency or by other appropriate agencies of the us government 
these agencies have the right to challenge our cost estimates or allocations with respect to any such contract 
a substantial portion of payments to us under us government contracts are provisional payments that are subject to potential adjustment upon audit by such agencies 
the majority of our contracts  particularly for our space and ground infrastructure systems  are long term contracts 
we recognize revenues on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue  and therefore profit  is recognized based on actual costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs to complete the contract or based on specific delivery terms and conditions 
revenue recognition and profitability  if any  from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that original cost estimates  estimated costs to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
the costs and other effects of pending or possible litigation or governmental investigations could have an adverse effect on our business and could divert the attention of management from ongoing business matters 
virtually all our products and services face significant competition from existing competitors  many of whom are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do 
furthermore  the possibility exists that other domestic or foreign companies or governments will seek to produce products or services that compete with our products or services 
a foreign competitor could benefit from subsidies from  or other protective measures by  its home country 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have any material exposure to interest rate changes  commodity price changes  foreign currency fluctuations  or similar market risks  although it does enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against specific foreign currency fluctuations  principally with respect to the canadian dollar
