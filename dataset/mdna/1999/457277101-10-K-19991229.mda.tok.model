item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described in the section titled factors affecting operating results set forth below 
overview inktomi was formed in february to develop and market scalable software applications designed to significantly enhance the performance and intelligence of large scale networks  particularly the internet 
our applications fall into two broad categories network products and portal services 
our network products applications currently consist of the traffic server network cache platform and associated media ixt applications  and our portal services offerings currently consist of our search engine  shopping engine and directory engine applications 
network products revenues are composed of traffic server and media ixt licenses  consulting  support and maintenance fees 
traffic server and media ixt license fees are based on the number of cpus running the software and are generally recognized upon shipment of the software 
consulting  support and maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the service period 
portal services revenues are composed of revenues generated through our search engine  directory engine and shopping engine 
we generate revenues from our search engine and directory engine through a variety of contractual arrangements  which include per query search fees  search service hosting fees  advertising revenue  license fees and maintenance fees 
per query  hosting and maintenance fees revenues are recognized in the period earned  and advertising revenues are recognized in the period that the advertisement is displayed 
to date  revenues from the directory engine have not been significant 
we are still developing the business model for our shopping engine and anticipate that revenues will be generated by revenue sharing arrangements with online merchants  and by per query search fees  advertising revenue and license  support and maintenance fees from internet portals and other web site customers 
revenues from online shopping have not been significant to date and are expected to be modest for the next few quarters 
in october  we acquired webspective software  inc webspective  a developer of software solutions for content and application distribution  delivery and management  to supplement our network products offerings 
we offer these software solutions as the inktomi content distribution suite 
the acquisition of webspective will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
financial results for historical periods will be restated to reflect the combined operations beginning in the quarter ended december  inktomi expects to record acquisition costs of approximately million in the quarter ending december  as a result of the acquisition  primarily for investment banking fees  accounting  legal and other expenses 
webspective revenues from inception through september  were million 
webspective raised million through various stock issuances since its inception in march  and had net losses from inception to september  of million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several quarters 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses across all lines of business  and in particular in our shopping engine business as we continue to develop and enhance our shopping technology  solidify and refine the business model  and initiate new sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
result of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
for the year ended september  revenues network products portal services total revenues operating expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition related costs total operating expenses operating loss other income  net net loss fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues were million in the fiscal year ended september   an increase of million or over the year ended september  no customers individually represented over of total revenues for the fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   four customers each represented over and  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total revenues 
network products revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over network products revenues of million in fiscal most of these revenues represented new traffic server license sales 
for the year ended september   two customers represented and of all network products revenue  and for the year ended september   two customers represented and of all network products revenue 
portal services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or over portal services revenues of million in fiscal most of the increase was the result of revenues generated from new search customers 
the increase in portal services revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues recorded from the hotbot site as discussed below 
for the year ended september   three customers represented  and of all portal services revenue  and for the year ended september   two customers represented and of all portal services revenue 
historically  a significant portion of portal services revenues has been derived from the hotbot search service 
from our inception through the first three months of fiscal  hotbot was maintained by us and marketed by wired digital 
during this period  we recorded the gross value of advertising revenues  including barter revenues  generated on the site and recorded amounts due to wired digital as marketing expense 
in the second quarter of fiscal  wired digital assumed maintenance of the hotbot site 
due to the change in our status as operator of the hotbot site  we recorded net revenues from hotbot for the remainder of the fiscal year ended september  barter revenues represented and of total revenues recorded in fiscal and respectively 
expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues consist primarily of expenses related to the operation of our search and shopping services  which are primarily depreciation and network charges 
cost of revenues was million for fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased depreciation and network charges resulting from continued expansions of our data centers in california and the establishment of a data center in the united kingdom during fiscal we expect cost of revenues to increase substantially in absolute dollars in the next few quarters as a result of expanded cluster operation costs 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force and marketing staff and marketing programs  including trade shows and advertising 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel in the united states and overseas  expenses incurred in connection with attendance at trade shows and additional marketing programs  and increased sales commissions 
the increase was partially offset by lower hotbot marketing expenses since we no longer record hotbot advertising revenues on a gross basis as a marketing expense  as described above 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase substantially in absolute dollars over the next few quarters as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  initiate additional marketing programs to support each of our product lines  and establish sales offices in additional domestic and international locations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our development and technical support efforts 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over the comparable period in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel to support expansion of our search engines and network products businesses  online shopping development  and increases in quality assurance  technical support and technical publications personnel 
we believe significant investment in research and development is essential to our future success and expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
we have not capitalized any software development expenses to date 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  human resources  facilities and legal 
general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel and increased accounting and legal costs incurred in connection with business activities 
acquisition related charges in september  we acquired cb technologies  a developer of online shopping software 
we accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition costs of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition 
the charge comprised cb s financial advisory fees  facilities consolidation costs  and legal and accounting fees related to the transaction 
as of september   all acquisition related costs had been paid 
in april  we acquired impulse buy network  a developer of online merchandising software  to supplement the functionality of our shopping engine 
we accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of interests 
we recorded acquisition costs of approximately million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition  primarily for accounting  legal and other expenses 
as of september   all acquisition related costs had been paid 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net includes income on our cash and short term investments  less expenses related to our debt and capital lease obligations 
other income and expense  net  totaled million of income in fiscal  compared to million of income in fiscal most of this increase was generated from interest income on proceeds from our august and november public offerings  partially offset by increased interest charges on debt and capital lease obligations 
we also recognized losses for the abandonment of leasehold improvements and equipment with a net book value of approximately million due to corporate relocation in fiscal fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues were million in the year ended september   an increase of million or over the year ended september  four customers each represented over and  in the aggregate  of total revenues for the year ended september  for the year ended september   two customers accounted for approximately of total revenues 
network products revenues totaled million in fiscal most of these revenues represented new traffic server license fees 
there were minimal network products revenues in fiscal portal services revenues totaled million in fiscal  representing a increase over the prior year 
most of this increase came from the provision of search services to new customers and  to a lesser extent  an increase in revenues from existing search customers 
a significant portion of portal services revenues were derived from the hotbot search service maintained by us and marketed by wired digital 
a portion of the advertising on the hotbot site was exchanged for advertisements on the internet sites of other companies 
the value of these advertisements was recognized as barter revenue by us 
barter revenues represented of total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues was million for fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased depreciation and network charges resulting from expansions of our data center in california during fiscal  and the addition of a new service facility in virginia in the third quarter of fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel in the united states and abroad  increased hotbot marketing expenses and other customer related costs  and expenses incurred in connection with attendance at trade shows and additional marketing programs 
research and development research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel to support expansion of our portal services and network products businesses  initial online shopping development  and increases in quality assurance  technical support and technical publications personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of general and administrative personnel and increased legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with business activities 
acquisition related charges in september  we acquired cb technologies  a developer of online shopping software 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we incurred expenses of million related to the transaction 
the charge included cb s financial advisory fees  facilities consolidation costs  and legal and accounting fees 
of the total charge  million of the expenses were paid in fiscal other income and expense  net interest income  net totaled million of income in fiscal  compared to a net other expense of million in fiscal most of this increase was generated from interest income on proceeds from our june initial public offering and prior preferred stock issuances  partially offset by increased interest charges on debt and capital lease obligations 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at september   up from million at september  most of the increase came from sales of common stock  partially offset by cash used in operations and the purchase of property and equipment 
we used million in cash used in operations in fiscal  an increase of million from the million used in fiscal the increase in cash used in operations was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and other assets  partially offset by increased depreciation  increases in accrued expenses and an increase in deferred revenue in the fiscal year ended september  we have made significant investments in equipment since inception 
this equipment consists largely of computer servers  workstations and networking equipment 
we invested million and million  respectively  in fiscal and primarily to further expand our internet search engine service capacity  to launch and support our online shopping business and for leasehold improvements at our new corporate headquarters 
from time to time  we have used debt and leases to partially finance capital purchases and intend to continue this practice until we begin generate cash from operations 
we obtained an additional million and million in bank loans and added million and million  in capitalized leases to partially fund increased search and online shopping capacity in fiscal and  respectively 
at september   inktomi had million in total loans and capitalized lease obligations outstanding 
the loans are collateralized by the underlying assets 
approximately million of our debt at september  was in the form of bank loans 
the bank loans include certain covenants requiring minimum liquidity  tangible net worth and profitability over time 
in fiscal  we sold million of fixed assets to two leasing companies as part of sale leaseback transactions 
we raised million  net of issuance costs  from equity sales during fiscal this includes million from the sale of common stock and million from stock option and warrant exercises 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of inktomi s products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing international operations  the extent and timing of investments  acquisition costs  and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to hire and expand our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations  to expand marketing programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and for other general corporate activities 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as a result  software that records only the last two digits of the calendar year may not be able to distinguish whether means or this may result in software failures or the creation of erroneous results 
we utilize a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems across our company 
these programs and operating systems include proprietary and third party applications used in our traffic server network cache product  our content distribution suite software  our search  directory and online shopping services  and our internal systems 
to the extent that these applications are unable to appropriately process dates in the calendar year  some level of modification or replacement may be necessary 
we initiated our year compliance program in early by conducting a preliminary review of our traffic server and search engine software code and by performing preliminary tests on these applications to determine year compliance 
we also began making inquiries of the vendors of our essential internal business systems to assess their year readiness 
since this time  we have increased the scope of our business operations  developed new versions of our traffic server and search engine software  acquired and enhanced our online shopping engine software  developed and released the first version of our directory engine software and acquired our content distribution suite 
this expansion led us to hire a full time year project coordinator in early to manage our year efforts 
under his direction  we developed a comprehensive year compliance plan covering each of our software products  our search  directory and shopping services operations  and our internal business systems 
we have completed a code review and testing of current versions of our traffic server software to ensure year readiness 
based on this review and testing  we believe that these versions of our traffic server software  when configured and used in accordance with its documentation  correctly functions when used with year date codes 
although we have reviewed the software code and tested earlier versions of our traffic server software and believe them to be year compliant  we have not performed our suite of tests on these versions 
we have recommended that our customers upgrade to our later traffic server versions 
we have also reviewed the software code to our content distribution suite  which we acquired through the acquisition of webspective software  and performed limited testing 
based on this review and testing  we believe that our content distribution suite  when configured and used in accordance with its documentation  correctly functions when used with year date codes 
our traffic server software runs on several hardware platforms and associated operating systems  including those provided by sun  compaq and silicon graphics  and those based on intel architecture 
our content distribution suite software runs on sun and systems utilizing the windows nt operating system 
these software products are therefore dependent upon the correct processing of dates by these systems 
we have reviewed information made publicly available by our hardware platform partners regarding year compliance 
based on this review  we do not believe the underlying systems that operate in conjunction with our traffic server software or our content distribution suite software contain material year deficiencies in their latest releases 
we have reviewed the software code for our search engine  directory engine and shopping engine software and performed testing on these applications 
based on this review and testing  we believe that these products correctly function when used with year date codes 
we provide our search  directory and shopping services from multiple computer clusters  most of which are housed at facilities operated by a single hosting provider in the united states 
search  directory and shopping services for certain european customers are generated from clusters housed at a single hosting provider in the united kingdom 
our computer clusters are reliant on security  climate control and internet connectivity  all of which are provided and maintained by the hosting providers 
we have obtained affirmative documentation as to their year readiness 
our software applications operate in accordance with several external internet protocols  such as http and nntp  and are therefore dependent upon the correct processing of dates by these protocols 
we have researched the date handling capabilities of these protocols and do not believe they contain material year deficiencies 
we use multiple software systems for our internal business purposes  including accounting  e mail  development  human resources  customer service and support  and sales  most of which have been purchased in the last two years 
we completed an inventory of our internal systems and reviewed the web sites of key system vendors to confirm the systems year readiness 
the current versions of all key systems have been declared year compliant by the vendors 
to date  the costs incurred to perform the assessment of our year readiness have not been material  and have consisted primarily of the cost of our project manager and labor costs for our quality assurance  software development and information technology personnel 
despite investigation and testing by us and our partners  our software products  and the underlying systems  services and protocols running our products may contain errors or defects associated with year date functions 
we are unable to predict to what extent our business may be affected if our software or the systems that operate in conjunction with our software experience a material year failure 
known or unknown errors or defects that affect the operation of our software could result in delay or loss of revenue  interruption of search or shopping services  cancellation of customer contracts  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  and litigation costs  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
factors affecting operating results interested persons should carefully consider the risks described below in evaluating inktomi 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
we have a history of operating losses  expect to incur future losses  and cannot be certain that we will become a profitable company 
inktomi was founded in february and has a limited operating history 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several quarters 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses across all lines of our business  and in particular in our shopping engine business as we continue to develop and enhance our shopping technology  solidify and refine the business model  and initiate new sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
although our revenues have grown in recent quarters  we cannot be sure that this growth will continue at the same rate or that we will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
if we do achieve profitability  we cannot be sure that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our business substantially depends upon the success of our traffic server product 
our future growth substantially depends on the commercial success of our traffic server network cache product  which we have licensed to only a small number of customers 
we are initially targeting telecommunications carriers and internet service providers for our traffic server product  although we are expanding our customer prospects to include internet hosting providers  oem customers and large enterprise customers 
our ability to generate substantial and sustained revenues from our traffic server product is dependent upon achieving sales penetration in each of these market segments and significantly increasing the number of new and repeat customer transactions 
the market for large scale network caching is in its early stages  and we are not sure our target customers will widely adopt and deploy caching technology throughout their networks 
even if they do so  they may not choose our traffic server network cache product  because it does not include the features they require  they wish to outsource content distribution services to a third party vendor rather than directly implement caching in their networks  or for technical  cost  support or other reasons 
although we have tested our traffic server product prior to making it available to customers  we cannot be sure that we have found and fixed all significant performance errors 
if our target customers do not widely adopt and purchase our traffic server product  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
our business would be harmed if customers choose not to use or promote our search and directory services 
revenues from our search and directory services result primarily from the number of end user searches that are processed by our search engine and directory engine and the level of advertising revenue generated by our internet portal and other web site customers 
our agreements with customers do not require them to direct end users to our search or directory services or to use our search or directory services exclusively or at all 
accordingly  revenues from search and directory services are highly dependent upon the willingness of customers to promote and use the search and directory services we provide  the ability of our customers to attract end users to their online services  the volume of end user searches that are processed by our search engine and directory engine  and the ability and willingness of customers to sell advertisements on the internet pages viewed by end users 
certain of our customers have selected competing search and directory services to operate in combination with our services  which has reduced the number of queries available for us to serve and may erode future revenue growth opportunities 
the technological barriers for customers to implement additional services or to replace our services are not substantial 
our entry into the online shopping business will require us to develop significant new capabilities and may not be successful 
the online shopping market is in a rapid state of evolution with a wide variety of companies  including large internet portals  online merchants  online merchant aggregators  auction sites and other web sites  expending substantial funds to develop brand recognition and large bases of end user consumers 
we are still developing and refining the business model for our internet shopping engine in light of this rapidly changing business environment 
we continue to anticipate that revenues will be generated by revenue sharing arrangements with online merchants  and by per query search fees  advertising revenue and license  support and maintenance fees from internet portals and other web site customers 
the success of our shopping engine will largely depend on a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include 
our ability to establish and maintain strong relationships with customers and online merchants  
our ability to assemble a robust and varied database of products of interest to end user consumers  
the ability and willingness of our customers to promote our shopping services on their web sites  
the dollar volume of online purchases made by end users of our customers web sites  
the ability of participating merchants to successfully merchandize their products through our shopping engine  and 
the level of advertising revenues generated by customers 
we launched the first commercial version of our internet shopping engine in mid our shopping engine is designed to collect and organize vast amounts of electronic information from online merchants and publishers of comparative product information 
the shopping engine is also designed to track and confirm purchases made by end users of our customers services and to generate invoices for our online merchants to pay revenue sharing amounts to us 
these are highly complex tasks 
we have experienced some difficulty and delays in implementing our shopping service  stabilizing and optimizing our product database  consistently tracking end user consumer purchases and rolling out new features 
we anticipate that resolving current technological challenges  developing required features to meet current customer commitments  and developing and deploying new features will require significant additional expenses and management and development resources 
we have made significant investments in our online shopping business and expect to continue to do so 
this investment has been and will continue to be required in advance of generating revenues  which have not been significant to date and are expected to be modest for the next few quarters 
we cannot be sure that our entry into the online shopping business will be successful 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete successfully against new entrants and established companies with greater resources 
we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we face competition in the overall network infrastructure market as well as the network cache  internet search directory and online shopping segments of this market 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
competition in the network cache market continues to intensify as market segmentation is increasing  new solutions are coming to market and several companies are forming technology alliances and oem relationships to sell their products 
we directly compete against several other companies that sell network caching products  including cacheflow  cisco systems  infolibria  microsoft  netscape  network appliance  novell and spyglass 
we also compete against freeware caching solutions including cern  harvest and squid 
in addition  we compete against companies that provide content distribution services including akamai technologies  inc further  we are aware of numerous other major software developers as well as smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with traffic server 
we also believe that traffic server may face competition from other providers of competing solutions to network infrastructure problems  including networking hardware and software manufacturers  traditional hardware manufacturers  telecommunications providers  cable tv communications providers  software database companies  and large diversified software and technology companies 
many of these companies provide or have announced their intentions to provide a range of software and hardware products based on internet protocols and to compete in the broad internet intranet software market as well as in specific market segments in which we compete 
we compete with a number of companies to provide internet search and directory services  many of which have operated services in the market for a longer period  have greater financial resources  have established marketing relationships with leading online services and advertisers  and have secured greater presence in distribution channels 
traditionally  our competitors have provided search directory services directly to end users through their own web sites and have supplied search directory services to third party web sites as a supplement to this business 
however  we are facing increased competition from several newer competitors that are following our business model of providing internet search directory services primarily to internet portals and other web site customers 
these newer competitors have focused on search result relevance and ease of use in providing their services  and many of them have recently completed significant financings or initial public offerings 
we currently compete with companies including alta vista  ask jeeves  direct hit technologies  fast search and transfer  google  infoseek  looksmart  lycos  netscape open directory and northern light 
in addition  large media companies  such as the walt disney company and nbc enterprises  and other internet based companies such as america online and excite home  have recently made investments in or acquired internet search engine companies  and we believe that other large media enterprises may enter or expand their presence in the internet search and directory market  either directly or indirectly through collaborations or other strategic alliances 
the market for our shopping engine application is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
our current and potential competitors include other oem providers of shopping technologies and services including bottom dollar  infospace and mysimon  third party merchant aggregators including affinia  snapshot and wizshop  and internet portals and other captive marketplace web sites  including amazon 
com  america online  excite home  lycos and yahoo 
we believe the principal factors that will draw end users to an online shopping application include brand availability  selection  personalized services  convenience  price  accessibility  customer service  quality of search tools  quality of content  and reliability and speed of fulfillment for products ordered 
we have little or no control over many of these factors 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
in addition  our current and potential competitors may bundle their products with other software or hardware  including operating systems and browsers  in a manner that may discourage users from purchasing products offered by us 
also  current and potential competitors have greater name recognition  more extensive customer bases and access to proprietary content 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  fewer search queries served  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the loss of a key customer could adversely affect our revenues and be perceived as a loss of momentum in our business 
we have generated a substantial portion of our historical revenues from a limited number of customers 
we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  if we lose a major customer for any reason  including non renewal of a customer contract  or in the case of our search engine business  if there is a decline in usage of any customer s search service  our revenues would be adversely affected 
in addition  potential customers of inktomi and public market analysts or investors may perceive any such loss as a loss of momentum in our business  which may adversely affect future opportunities to sell our products and services and cause our stock price to decline 
also  we cannot be sure that customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to generate revenues in any future period 
if we do not meet performance requirements in our portal services agreements  customers may cancel our service or choose a different service 
our search engine  directory engine and shopping engine agreements typically include specific performance requirements  including the features provided  reliability  processing speed  size of the internet database maintained  number of merchants and products within the database  and frequency of updating the database 
in addition  we believe it is important to maintain features and functionality that are not explicitly covered in our agreements  such as high relevance of search and product results 
the growing volume of search queries processed by our search engine and the frequency with which we update our portal services to include additional functionality have placed some strain on our operational capability to meet customer requirements 
if we do not meet these requirements  customers may cancel our service or choose to use a different service 
circumstances beyond our control may result in service interruptions which could cause our business to suffer 
we provide our portal services from multiple data centers  all of which are housed at facilities operated by a single source hosting provider 
circumstances outside of our control such as fires  earthquakes  power failures  telecommunications failures  sabotage  unauthorized intrusions into our databases and similar events may bring down one or more of our data centers 
for example  in june  lightning struck the facility housing our data center in virginia  interrupting service from this center 
in addition  our data center hosting provider has experienced network failures from time to time  which has also interrupted our service 
service interruptions for any reason would reduce our revenues and could result in contract cancellations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will come from licenses of traffic server 
we further expect that these revenues will come from licenses of traffic server to a small number of customers 
the volume and timing of orders are difficult to predict because the market for traffic server is in its early stages and the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer 
the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses of traffic server would reduce our expected revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
to the extent significant sales occur earlier than expected  operating results for later quarters may not compare favorably with operating results from earlier quarters 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
we plan to significantly increase our operating expenses to enhance and support our online shopping business  expand our sales and marketing operations  broaden our customer support capabilities  establish new data centers  develop new distribution channels  and fund greater levels of research and development 
a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for the reasons set forth above or for any other reason could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and the price of our common stock may fall 
our operating results may fluctuate because the sales cycle for traffic server is long 
to date  our customers have taken a long time to evaluate traffic server  and many people within our customers organizations have been involved in the process 
along with our distribution partners  we spend a significant amount of time educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of traffic server 
even after purchase  our customers tend to deploy traffic server slowly and deliberately  depending on the skill set of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment  and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy traffic server 
the long sales and implementation cycles for traffic server may cause license revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
our success depends on our ability to expand our sales and support organizations 
we will need to substantially expand our direct and indirect sales operations  both domestically and internationally  in order to increase market awareness and sales of our products 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at several people within our prospective customers organizations 
we have recently expanded our direct sales force and plan to hire additional sales personnel 
competition for qualified sales personnel is intense  and we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting 
in addition  we believe that our future success is dependent upon establishing and maintaining productive relationships with a variety of distribution partners  including oems  resellers  systems integrators and joint marketing partners 
we seek to sign up distribution partners that have a substantial amount of technical expertise in the computer network and telecommunications industry 
even with this expertise  our distribution partners generally require a significant amount of training and support from us  and we anticipate that it will take several quarters before any of our distribution partners will develop the expertise and skills we believe necessary to effectively sell our products 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in signing up desired distribution partners or that our distribution partners will devote adequate resources or have the technical and other sales capabilities to sell our products 
similarly  the complexity of our products and the difficulty of installing them require highly trained customer service and support personnel 
we currently have a small customer service and support organization and will need to increase our staff to support new customers  new product lines such as the recent addition of our directory engine  the expanding needs of existing customers and the internationalization of our business 
competition for customer service and support personnel is intense in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the internet 
our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have grown our headcount substantially 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems  personnel and other resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  enhance our internal and external security systems  and continue to expand  train and manage our work force worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers  merchants and other third parties 
the legal environment in which we operate is uncertain and claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
our products and services operate in part by making copies of material available on the internet and other networks and making this material available to end users from a central location 
in addition  our portal services technology systems collect end user and transaction information  which we use to deliver services to our customers and merchant partners 
this creates the potential for claims to be made against us either directly or through contractual indemnification provisions with customers for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content  copying  collection or use of these materials 
these claims have been threatened against us from time to time and have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against online service providers 
it is also possible that if any information provided through any of our portal services or facilitated by our traffic server product contains errors  third parties could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on this information 
further  there is the potential for product liability claims to be asserted against us by end users who purchase goods and services through our shopping engine 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or be adequate to protect us from all liability that may be imposed 
internet related laws could adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations which apply to communications and commerce over the internet are becoming more prevalent 
the most recent session of the united states congress resulted in internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights  taxation and the transmission of sexually explicit material 
the european union recently enacted its own privacy regulations  and is currently considering copyright legislation that may extend the right of reproduction held by copyright holders to include the right to make temporary copies for any reason 
the law of the internet  however  remains largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online 
the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet  or interpretations of existing law  could adversely affect our business 
the internet infrastructure market is rapidly changing and we must develop and introduce new products and technologies to remain competitive 
the internet infrastructure market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
the increasing scope of our business has led us to allocate additional resources to our current business opportunities and fewer resources to longer term projects 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
material delays in introducing new products and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our products or purchase those of our competitors 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with customers and the companies that supply and distribute our products  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with key hardware and software vendors  internet technology and service providers  distribution partners and customers 
we believe these relationships are important in order to validate our technology  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products  enhance our product and service offering  and expand our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
if we are unable to develop key relationships or maintain and enhance existing relationships  we may have difficulty selling our products and services 
we have from time to time licensed components from others such as reporting functions and security features and incorporated them into our products and services 
if these licensed components are not maintained  it could impair the functionality of our products and services and require us to obtain alternative products from other sources or to develop this software internally  either of which could involve costs and delays as well as diversion of engineering resources 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need to succeed 
we intend to hire a significant number of additional sales  support  marketing  and research and development personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel 
in addition  our products and technologies are complex  and we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing engineering personnel  and especially our founders 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
our relationships with these officers and key employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
any acquisitions that we make could adversely affect our operations or financial results 
we have purchased three companies since september and intend to continue to invest in or acquire complementary companies  products or technologies in the future 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
also  we could have difficulty in integrating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our stockholders 
our efforts to increase our presence in markets outside of the united states may be unsuccessful and could result in losses 
we market and sell our products in the united states and internationally 
we have offices in england  france  germany  japan and korea to market and sell our products in those countries and surrounding regions 
we plan to establish additional facilities in other parts of the world 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be sure that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
we currently have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing our products internationally 
in addition  other inherent risks may apply to international operations  including 
the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  
greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  
potentially adverse tax consequences  and 
political and economic instability 
our international expenses are generally denominated in local currencies 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities 
although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has been insignificant  future fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect results of international operations 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our ability to compete 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
intellectual property claims against us could cause our business to suffer 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry 
we expect that software products may be increasingly vulnerable to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
lycos has announced that it is the exclusive licensee of a patent covering a method of crawling information on the internet  and that it may bring actions against companies that it believes are infringing this patent in the future 
we also believe that many companies have filed or intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology that they may claim our technology infringes 
some of these companies have sent copies of their patents to inktomi for informational purposes 
we cannot be sure that lycos or other third parties will not make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and technology 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  and could cause product shipment delays or require us to reengineer our products or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if our products or the products upon which we depend malfunction because of year problems  our operations may be interrupted and we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims 
our software products operate in complex network environments and directly and indirectly interact with a number of other hardware and software systems 
despite investigation and testing by us and our partners  our software products and the underlying systems and protocols running our products may contain errors or defects associated with year date functions 
we are unable to predict to what extent our business may be affected if our software or the systems that operate in conjunction with our software experience a material year failure 
known or unknown errors or defects that affect the operation of our software could result in delay or loss of revenue  interruption of search or shopping services  cancellation of customer contracts  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  and litigation costs  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources
