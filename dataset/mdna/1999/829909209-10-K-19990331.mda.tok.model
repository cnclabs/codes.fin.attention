factors affecting future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including in this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements  and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of and releases of the securities and exchange commission 
in particular  certain statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated availability of capital for working capital and for capital expenditures constitute forward looking statements 
the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the other risks discussed in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales and profitability from period to period  including competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  availability of foundry capacity and raw materials  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  the company s ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  introduction of products and technologies by the company s competitors  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter  the timing of investments in research and development  including tooling expenses associated with product development  process improvements and production  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development and for inventory in anticipation of increasing sales levels  operating results would be adversely affected if increased sales are not achieved 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and operating results 
supply and manufacturing risks the company currently relies on three outside foundries to supply fully processed semiconductor wafers 
there are significant risks associated with reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of assured wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
the company is also subject to significant manufacturing risks including yield variances which the company or its outside foundries may experience 
intellectual property rights the company relies on certain intellectual property protections to preserve its intellectual property rights 
any invalidation of these intellectual property rights or lengthy and expensive defense of these rights could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on new products the company s success will depend upon its ability to develop new semiconductor devices for existing and new markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner and to have such products selected for design into new products of its customers 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields and market acceptance of the company s and its customers products 
competition  the semiconductor industry the company competes with several domestic semiconductor companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources and broader product lines than the company 
the company believes that its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the breadth of its product line  the ability to develop and introduce new products rapidly  product innovation  product quality and reliability  product performance  price  technical service and support  adequacy of manufacturing quality and capacity and sources of raw materials  efficiency of production  delivery capabilities and protection of the company s products by intellectual property laws 
the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and is subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production over capacity 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuation in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions and overall economic conditions 
international sales the company derives a significant portion of its net sales from international sales  including asia  which are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting the company s intellectual property overseas  seasonality of sales and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that recent economic troubles in certain asian countries will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
stock price volatility the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
year readiness disclosure statement the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has assessed its information technology systems and non it systems such as building security  voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors and has determined the nature and extent of the work required  if any  to make these internal systems year compliant 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company selected new enterprise and manufacturing software systems which are year compliant and began implementation of these systems in the fourth quarter of implementation is scheduled to be fully complete by september the company s business is dependent upon its information systems which are an integral part of all major business processes 
as the company progresses through the implementation of these critical operational and logistical modules  there is a risk that these implementations could be delayed  could experience difficulties or in fact may not be successful and could adversely affect future results of operations and cash flows 
the company s current enterprise and manufacturing system is being upgraded to become year compliant in the second quarter of and will remain in place until the new system is fully operational 
in addition  the company s semiconductor manufacturing and payroll systems are being updated and are expected to be year compliant by september future expenditures on the general upgrade of internal computer systems are estimated to be million  a portion of which would be to become year compliant 
the majority of these expenditures will be capitalized in to the extent in which they relate to the costs of implementation of new systems 
year remediation costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company has conducted a written survey of its foundries and other suppliers of products and services with which it has a material relationship in order to identify and assess their year readiness and compliance  and any negative impacts that any non compliance could have on the company 
based upon the survey responses  the company found all of these principal suppliers to be year compliant 
although management believes the company s systems will be year compliant  the failure of the company s suppliers to address the year issue could result in disruption to the company s operations and have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations  the extent of which the company has not yet estimated 
in addition  the company continues to work with its customers to identify potential year issues with its customers products 
many of the company s key customers are fortune companies  are sensitive to year issues and are expected to be year compliant 
however  the company continues to survey its customers and monitor their progress in ensuring year compliance 
the company is not actively engaged in preparing contingency plans in the event that key customers or suppliers fail to become year compliant 
however  the company  in the ordinary course of business  seeks to expand its customer base to lessen dependence on any one customer for a significant portion of its revenues  and seeks second sources of supply for its key products and services where appropriate 
at this time  the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is that it will be unable to successfully complete the implementation of its enterprise and manufacturing systems discussed above 
however  the company has developed contingency plans for this risk and continues to develop further contingency plans for both mission critical and non mission critical systems as it identifies the year risks 
various statements in this discussion of year issues are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include the inability of the company to complete the plans and modifications that it has identified  the wide variety of information systems and components  both hardware and software  that must be evaluated  the variety  number and complexity of equipment used in the company s operations and the large number of vendors and customers with which the company interacts 
the company s assessments of the effects of year on the company are based  in part  upon information received from third parties and the company s reasonable reliance on that information 
therefore  the risk that inaccurate information is supplied by third parties upon which the company reasonably relied must be considered as a risk factor that might affect the company s year efforts 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve the company s capital until it is required to fund operations  including the company s research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the company does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to the risk of a decline in interest rates 
investment rate risk the company s investment portfolio includes debt instruments that are primarily united stated government bonds of less than one year in duration 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
the company s investment portfolio also consists of certain commercial paper which is also subject to interest rate risk 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
