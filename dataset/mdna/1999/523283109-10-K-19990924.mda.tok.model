hallmark capital corp 
the company is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of wisconsin and is engaged in the financial services business through its wholly owned subsidiary  west allis savings bank the bank  a wisconsin state chartered stock savings bank headquartered in milwaukee  wisconsin 
the company s initial public offering was consummated in december  and the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of the bank issued in the mutual to stock conversion of the bank the conversion on december  the company s primary strategy since the conversion has been to focus on effectively utilizing the capital acquired in the conversion through asset growth and asset portfolio diversification into higher yielding assets 
this strategy resulted in an increase in the company s asset size from million at june  to million at june  the company s asset growth has come primarily through i the origination and purchase of mortgage loans principally loans secured by one to four family owner occupied homes within and outside of the company s primary lending area  ii the purchase of mortgage backed and related securities  and iii the origination and purchase of commercial real estate and business loans within and outside of the company s primary lending area 
this asset growth was funded through significant increases in federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowings  and increases in deposits consisting primarily of brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits 
the company s asset portfolio diversification has been  and continues to be  achieved by altering the composition of loans and securities originated  purchased  sold and held in the total asset portfolio 
in particular  the company has focused on originating and purchasing higher yielding multi family  commercial real estate and commercial business loans secured by properties or assets located within the company s primary lending area as defined herein  to either replace or supplement lower yielding one to four family mortgage loans and principal run off from the mortgage securities portfolio 
as part of its asset portfolio diversification strategy  the company established a new commercial lending division in fiscal to originate commercial industrial real estate term loans  construction loans  equipment leasing  inventory equipment receivables financing  lines of credit  letters of credit and government loan programs both within and outside of the company s primary lending area 
in fiscal  the company intends to continue its asset portfolio diversification strategy while maintaining a steady rate of growth of its asset base 
in fiscal  the company s business strategy is to continue its focus on increasing net interest income and generating additional non interest income from existing and new revenue sources 
in order to increase net interest income  the company intends to continue to utilize its asset portfolio diversification strategy of selling lower yielding assets such as securities and one to four family mortgage loans that conform to federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and federal national mortgage association fannie mae guidelines in the secondary market to provide liquidity to fund higher yielding one to four family non conforming mortgage  multi family  commercial real estate and commercial business loan originations and purchases  increase non interest income and maintain adequate levels of capital 
the company anticipates that increased sales of one to four family conforming mortgage loans will decrease the proportion of the gross loan portfolio represented by such loans and will increase non interest income as a result of increased gains on the sales of such loans 
portfolio diversification in fiscal also will include an increased level of purchases of loans or participation interests in loans originated by other lenders both within and outside the company s primary lending area 
the company anticipates that slightly over half of the asset growth in fiscal will come from residential and commercial loan and participation interest purchases outside of its primary lending area 
loans purchased  or participation interests purchased  which relate to properties or business assets located outside of the company s primary lending area will primarily consist of higher yielding non conforming one to four family  multi family  commercial real estate  multi family construction  commercial real estate construction and commercial business loans 
in fiscal  the company projects total loan and participation interest purchases which relate to residential and commercial properties or business assets to be approximately million compared to million in fiscal the company anticipates that approximately million of such amount will relate to one to four family non conforming mortgage loans secured by properties located outside of the company s primary lending area and the balance approximately million will relate to the purchase of multi family  multi family construction  commercial real estate  commercial construction and commercial business loans secured by properties and assets located both inside and outside its primary lending area 
in deciding whether or not to purchase a loan or participation interest in a loan secured by properties or business assets located outside of the company s primary lending area  management of the company has applied  and will continue to apply  underwriting guidelines at least as strict as those applicable to the origination of similar loans within its primary lending area 
in fiscal  the company will evaluate opportunities to purchase one to four family mortgage loans which conform to fhmlc and fannie mae underwriting guidelines and non conforming portfolio loans which are not sold in the secondary agency market due to underwriting characteristics that do not conform to the secondary agency market 
purchases of conforming and non conforming one to four family mortgage loans will include lending opportunities on a national basis 
one to four family non conforming loans also will be originated by the company within its primary lending area 
in fiscal  the company also intends to continue increasing the activities of its commercial lending division as another element of its overall portfolio diversification strategy 
the focus of the company s commercial lending operation will be the origination and purchase of small business loans and leases 
during fiscal  the company originated and purchased million of multi family  commercial real estate  multi family construction  commercial construction and commercial business loans  lines of credit and leases 
management currently projects that the commercial lending division will increase its level of originations and purchases to approximately million in new commercial loans  lines of credit and leases during fiscal management believes the commercial lending component of its operations will benefit the company longer term and contribute to a long term increase in net income and return on equity 
the commercial lending division also has enhanced the company s core deposit base  through the establishment of new deposit relationships with the commercial lending division s customers 
the company also intends to enhance earnings in fiscal through non interest fee income generated from the company s new mortgage banking subsidiary  hallmark financial  inc d b a major finance 
major finance was established at the end of fiscal to provide lending activities involving higher credit risk financial services also known as subprime lending 
major finance currently acts as a broker of non conforming subprime residential and commercial mortgage loans 
the company anticipates that the majority of major finance s subprime lending activity will relate to residential mortgage loans as opposed to commercial real estate loans in fiscal as a broker  major finance interviews prospective borrowers  completes a loan application  collects and verifies financial data on the borrower and submits the loan file to a potential lender or investor 
the lender or investor makes the final underwriting decision and closes the loan in their own name 
major finance receives a fee directly from the lender or investor for its brokering services but major finance does not fund or retain the loan in its portfolio 
the company intends to evaluate opportunities to broker subprime loans both within and outside of its primary market area 
management estimates that major finance will broker approximately million in subprime loans  generating approximately  in fee income of such loans in fiscal the borrowers on such loans typically have credit deficiencies on their credit history  such as late mortgage loan payments  low credit scores  foreclosures or bankruptcies 
other non conforming factors which may result in a loan being classified as subprime include higher debt to income ratios  no down payment  limited documentation  high cash out refinances or no verification of the borrower s income or assets 
a secondary market of private investors and mortgage bankers provides a mechanism for the underwriting  funding  sale and servicing of subprime loans 
due to the higher degree of credit risk inherent in this type of lending  subprime residential mortgage loan rates generally are higher yielding compared to conventional one to four family mortgage rates  and if sold in the secondary market  a higher origination fee and yield spread premium are generally paid in connection with such loans 
the company currently intends to broker all subprime loans originated by major finance on a service released basis in fiscal however  in the event management decides to originate  service and retain any subprime loans in its portfolio in fiscal  instead of solely brokering such loans  a risk assessment and risk management policy would be established in advance and approved by the company s board of directors 
see lending activities subprime lending 
during fiscal  the company also intends to increase its non interest income by expanding the residential lending and commercial banking fee income producing divisions 
the company expects one to four family mortgage loan originations to remain strong despite the generally higher level of market interest rates 
it is currently anticipated that substantially all of the year fixed rate conforming one to four family mortgage loans originated in fiscal will be sold in the secondary market resulting in income from gains on loans sold 
the company also expects increased fee income from the commercial banking division resulting from a growth in business deposit relationships and loan originations 
the company expects its insurance subsidiary  hallmark planning services  inc  to continue to generate fee income from investment product and annuity sales 
the company also has recently implemented a program for mortgage contract cash processing within the commercial lending division  a service intended to generate fee income 
the bank acts as a partial sub servicer  providing a cash processing function for nationally originated commercial real estate loans 
the company also intends to expand its community relationship banking focus by targeting cross sales opportunities to individuals and businesses through customer segmentation and database marketing  planning the opening of a new retail location at the company s headquarters in glendale  wisconsin  and expanding the delivery of products and services through the internet

the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods 
the following table shows the interest income for periods indicated 
information is provided with respect to i effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  ii effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  and iii changes in rate volume changes in rate multiplied by changes in volume

the increase was funded primarily by an increase in fhlb chicago advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits and money market deposits 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase is largely attributable to the increase in deposits and borrowings 
investment securities decreased to at june  compared to  at june  the change was primarily the result of management s decision to decrease its portfolio of investment securities  which consist primarily of certificates of deposits in other financial institutions  due to the competitive yields on loans in fiscal and loan portfolio diversification 
securities available for sale increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase is the result of management s decision to increase its investment in securities available for sale due to favorable competitive yields on such securities and the increased level of repayments received on the loan portfolio 
at june   the securities available for sale portfolio contained million of fixed rate us government agency securities  million of agency and private issue fixed rate mortgage backed securities with a minimum investment rating of aa  million of private issue adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with a minimum investment rating of aa  million of fixed rate intermediate term tranche cmos with a minimum investment rating of aaa  million of floating rate tranche cmos with a minimum investment rating of aa  million in trust preferred securities  million of adjustable rate mortgage mutual funds and  of municipal bonds 
mortgage backed and related securities held for investment decreased to million at june  compared to million at june  the decrease is the result of management s decision to decrease its investment in mortgage backed and related securities to provide funding for the loan portfolio growth and diversification and increased investment in investment securities available for sale

at june   million of the mortgage backed and related securities portfolio consisted of private issue mortgage backed and related securities  each issue of which carried a minimum investment rating of aa at the time of purchase and at june  the decrease in mortgage backed and related securities was primarily attributable to the principal repayments of adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and cmos which was used for other funding and investment purposes in fiscal loans receivable increased to million at june  compared to million at june  the increase at june  compared to the prior fiscal year end is primarily the result of management s decision to retain more fixed rate loans originated and purchased for the company s portfolio  as such loans carried higher yields than comparable mortgage backed and related securities in fiscal total mortgage loans originated and purchased amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  while sales of fixed rate mortgage loans totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in fixed rate mortgage loan sales is primarily attributable to the lower interest rate environment during the first half of fiscal that increased the level of loans refinanced 
during fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans totaling million and million  respectively 
of the million in purchased loans  the company purchased million outside of its primary lending area  whereby management of the company has applied underwriting guidelines which are at least as strict as those applicable to the origination of similar loans within its primary lending area 
deposits increased million to million at june  from million at june  the increase in deposits was primarily due to the company s use of brokers and marketing efforts to increase the certificates of deposit with the company 
brokered deposits totaled million at june   representing of total deposits as compared to million  or of total deposits  at june  the average maturity of brokered deposits was four months at june   compared to eight months at june  non brokered wholesale deposits totaled million at june   representing of total deposits  as compared to million  or of total deposits  at june  deposits are the company s primary source of externally generated funds 
the level of deposits is heavily influenced by such factors as the general level of short and long term interest rates as well as alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing investment securities such as money market mutual funds 
fhlb chicago advances and other borrowings increased to million at june  compared to million at june  at june   fhlb advances were million  or of total liabilities  compared to million  or of total liabilities at june  borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements at june  totaled million 
there were no borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements at june  the company has increasingly used fhlb chicago advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as a funding source due to attractive rates offered on advances in relation to deposit funds obtainable in the company s local market 
the company uses borrowings from the fhlb chicago and securities sold under agreements to repurchase to manage the total asset liability portfolio of the company 
for a further discussion of fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are retail and wholesale brokered deposits  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments on mortgage backed and related securities and fhlb chicago advances 
alternative funding sources are evaluated and utilized based upon factors such as interest rates  availability  maturity  administrative costs and retention capability 
although maturity and scheduled amortization of loans are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  mortgage prepayments and prepayments on mortgage backed and related securities are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
mortgage loans and mortgage securities prepayments increased in fiscal overall as interest rates declined significantly during the first half of the fiscal year before increasing in the last half of the fiscal year 
during fiscal years and  prepayments increased as interest rates decreased in the second half of the both fiscal years 
the primary investing activity of the company is the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and related securities 
for fiscal  the company originated and purchased loans totaling million and million  respectively  as compared to fiscal when originated and purchased loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the company purchased mortgage backed and related securities in the amount of million and in fiscal and  respectively 
the company also purchased investment securities in the amount of  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal and  these activities were funded primarily by principal repayments on loans of million and million  respectively  principal repayments on mortgage backed and related securities of million and million  respectively  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans of million and million  respectively  proceeds from maturity of investment securities of  and  respectively  proceeds from notes payable to the fhlb chicago of million and million  respectively  and a net increase in deposits of million in fiscal purchases of securities available for sale totaled million and sales were million for fiscal  compared to purchases of million and sales of million for fiscal during fiscal  the company has found wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits to be an efficient source and a cost effective method  relative to local retail market deposits  of meeting the bank s funding needs 
in fiscal  pricing of wholesale brokered deposits ranged from to basis points above comparable term us treasury securities 
at june   the average rate of the wholesale brokered deposits accepted by the company was compared to an average rate paid for retail certificates of deposit of 
management believes that the strategy of leveraging the capital acquired in the conversion to achieve the targeted asset size established by the board of directors within a three to five year period following the conversion  could not have been achieved solely through the use of retail deposits from the local market 
management also believes that the costs  overhead and interest expense of achieving comparable retail deposit growth would have exceeded the costs related to the use of wholesale brokered deposits as a funding source 
however  management recognizes that the likelihood for retention of brokered certificates of deposit is more a function of the rate paid on such accounts as compared to retail deposits which may be established due to bank location or other intangible reasons 
during fiscal  management maintained a million backup credit facility for contingency purposes to replace funds from wholesale brokered deposits should retention of those deposits diminish due to extraordinary events in the financial markets 
the company s overall cost of funds has increased in recent years due primarily to a much greater percentage of the deposits being in certificates  both wholesale brokered and retail  as opposed to passbooks  money market accounts and checking accounts 
management believes that a significant portion of its retail deposits will remain with the company and  in the case of wholesale brokered deposits  may be replaced with similar type accounts even should the level of interest rates change 
however  in the event of a significant increase in market interest rates  the cost of obtaining replacement brokered deposits would increase as well 
the bank s board of directors has set a maximum limitation of total borrowings equal to of total assets 
this internal limit is below the allowable borrowing limit for all borrowings including fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements of of total assets established by the fhlb chicago 
at june   fhlb advances and borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements totaled million  or of the bank s total assets 
at june   the bank had unused borrowing authority under the borrowing limitations established by the board of directors of million and million under the fhlb total asset limitation 
the bank intends to fund asset portfolio diversification in fiscal through modest increases in fhlb advances  and to maintain the excess borrowing capacity with the fhlb as a contingent source of funds to meet liquidity needs as deemed necessary by the board of directors of the bank 
during fiscal  management shortened the maturities of both its wholesale brokered certificates of deposits and the fhlb borrowings to increase net interest income 
as of june   the average maturity of the wholesale brokered certificates of deposit was five months compared to eight months in fiscal and compared to a nine month maturity for retail certificates of deposits as of june  the company is required to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets under the regulations of the department of financial institutions  division of savings and loan for state chartered savings banks 
savings banks are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  certain bankers acceptances  certain corporate debt securities  securities of certain mutual funds and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations of not less than since april  and prior to that date 
the company s liquidity ratios were and at june  and  respectively 
the company adjusts its liquidity levels to meet various funding needs and to meet its asset and liability management objectives 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include investments in highly liquid  short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in deposits 
liquidity management for the company is both an ongoing and long term function of the company s asset liability management strategy 
excess funds generally are invested in short term investments such as federal funds or overnight deposits at the fhlb chicago 
whenever the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available and obtained from the wholesale brokered and non brokered market as well as the unused credit line from the fhlb chicago subject to the board imposed and regulatory limitations discussed herein  and funds also may be available through reverse repurchase agreements wherein the company pledges investment  mortgage backed or related securities 
the company maintains a million contingent backup credit facility to replace a portion of its interest rate sensitive liabilities such as borrowings and deposits should such funding sources become difficult to obtain or retain due to an adverse interest rate environment 
the company also has a federal funds open line of credit in the amount of million with a correspondent bank which does not require the direct pledging of any assets 
in addition  the company maintains a relatively high level of liquid assets  such as investment securities and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale  in order to insure sufficient sources of funds are available to meet the company s liquidity needs 
at june   the company had outstanding loan commitments of million 
the company had million in commitments to purchase securities and mortgage backed and related securities at june  the company anticipates it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments  including loan applications received and in process to the issuance of firm commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at june  totaled million 
impact of year the company is currently in the process of addressing a potential problem that faces all users of automated systems including information systems 
many computer systems process transactions based on two digits representing the year of transaction  rather than four digits 
these computer systems may not operate properly when the last two digits become  as will occur on january  the problem could affect a wide variety of automated information systems  such as mainframe applications  personal computers  communication systems  environmental systems and other information systems 
the company has identified areas of operations critical for the delivery of its loan and deposit products 
the majority of the company s applications used in operations are purchased from outside vendors 
the vendors providing the software are responsible for maintenance of the systems and modifications to enable uninterrupted usage after december  the company s plan includes obtaining certification of compliance from third parties and testing all of the impacted applications both internally developed and third party provided 
testing of the system and conversion activities were completed as of june  there are no mission critical systems which are non compliant 
the company has developed and finalized contingency plans for any adverse situations that may arise related to year the company s plan also includes reviewing any potential risks associated with loan and deposit data base information due to the year issue 
potential risks could include  but are not limited to  system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations which may include the temporary inability to process transactions  and to provide accurate customer loan payment or deposit receipt information 
based on currently available information  management does not anticipate that the cost to address the year issues will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position 
direct expenditures in fiscal year  and fiscal year for the year project totaled  and  respectively 
it is estimated that completion of the project will result in additional expenditures of approximately  direct expenditures include capital expenditures for compliant equipment and software  write offs of non compliant equipment and software upgrades 
the expenditures will be funded by increases in the company s non interest expense budget 
currently  the company is utilizing internal staff to coordinate the year project which may delay new product implementation through calendar year the company does not plan to engage consultants to complete the year project 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other parties on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and not have an adverse impact on the company s systems 
the company also made inquiries and reviewed plans of certain third parties  such as commercial loan customers  where year failures could result in significant adverse impact on the company 
the company has completed the inquiry and review process and is satisfied the bank will not be subject to significant adverse impact 
the board of directors of the company receives written status reports on the year project and meets with project leaders quarterly 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance asset liability management the company s profitability  like that of most financial institutions  depends to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the company is required to pay higher rates to attract deposits which can result in a decline in net interest income if the company is unable to increase the yield on its interest earning assets sufficiently to compensate for the increase in its cost of funds 
in an attempt to manage vulnerability to interest rate changes  management closely monitors the company s interest rate risk 
the company has established its investment strategies through an asset liability committee 
the committee consists of james smessaert  president ceo  peter gilbert  executive vice president coo  arthur thompson  senior vice president finance cfo  and elizabeth borst  senior vice president sales marketing 
the committee generally meets weekly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position  maturing securities and borrowings  interest rates and programs for increasing retail and brokered and non brokered wholesale deposits and originating and purchasing loans  and develops strategies regarding such issues 
in addition  the committee closely monitors the company s growth  profitability  liquidity and capital adequacy ratios 
minutes of these meetings are prepared and given to the board of directors for their review as well as formal quarterly asset liability management and investment strategy reports 
the company utilizes basic strategies in managing its assets and liabilities by managing or maximizing the net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
certain techniques such as hedging through the use of options  financial futures  and interest rate swaps historically have not been utilized by the company 
management does not intend to use such sophisticated techniques in the near future 
in addition to monitoring interest rate risk on a weekly basis  the company reviews loan and deposit rates weekly 
the emphasis has been on prudent pricing as opposed to increasing local retail market share  and the company has significantly supplemented and substituted retail deposits using fhlb chicago advances and wholesale brokered and non brokered deposits in fiscal and as a result of favorable advance and wholesale rates in relation to those obtainable on retail deposits 
generally  the company utilizes the following strategies to manage its interest rate risk i the company maintains a relatively high level of liquid assets  such as investment securities and mortgage backed and related securities available for sale  ii the company seeks to primarily originate and retain mortgage loans and mortgage backed and related securities with short to medium term periods to re pricing  iii the company attempts to extend the maturities of retail deposits when deemed cost effective through the pricing and promotion of certificates of deposit with longer terms  and periodically utilizes deposit marketing programs offering maturity and repricing terms structured to complement the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing asset liability mix  iv the company also attempts to extend the maturities of wholesale brokered deposits when deemed cost effective  and v the bank utilizes longer term borrowings from the fhlb chicago and reverse repurchase agreements to manage its assets and liabilities and enhance earnings 
at june   and  total fhlb chicago advances and borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements were million or of total assets  million or of total assets  and million or of total assets  respectively 
prior to january   most of the company s wholesale brokered and non brokered certificates of deposits had day initial maturities and  as of june   the average maturity was four months 
during the fiscal year ended june   management maintained the maturity level fixed rate term advances from the fhlb chicago to between one to five years 
liquidity is another factor in asset liability management 
as of june   the company had million in cash or demand deposits and million in its available for sale portfolio  of which million is due or will be repriced within one year 
the amount of the held to maturity portfolio as of june  was million  of which million will be due or repriced within one year 
during fiscal  the company increased its interest rate risk by funding fixed rate loan assets with shorter term wholesale deposits and borrowings 
the increase was due to the decreasing interest rate environment during the first half of fiscal that lead to the refinancing of loans to longer term fixed rate loans and early repayment of adjustable rate loans 
however  because of the relative liquidity of mortgage backed and related securities  the company can restructure its interest earning asset portfolios more quickly and effectively in a changing interest rate environment 
the company s arm loans and arm mortgage backed and related securities typically have annual and lifetime interest rate caps which reduce their ability to protect the company against a prolonged and significant increase in interest rates 
mortgage backed and related securities are subject to reinvestment risk 
for example  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage backed and related securities are more likely to prepay  and the company may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from prepayments in securities or other assets with yields similar to those of the prepaying mortgage backed and related securities 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it matures or reprices within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that same time period 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities that mature or reprice within a specified time period 
an interest rate sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets that mature or reprice within a specified time period 
at june  and  total interest bearing liabilities repricing within one year exceeded total interest bearing assets repricing in the same period by million and million  respectively  representing a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap equal to and  respectively  of total assets 
the increase in the company s negative one year gap reflects the increased use of shorter term maturity wholesale deposits and borrowings to fund fixed rate mortgage loans 
during periods of rising interest rates  a positive interest rate sensitivity gap would tend to positively affect net interest income while a negative interest rate sensitivity gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in addition to the potentially adverse effect on net interest income resulting from increasing interest rates due to the company s one year gap position  the company could experience a substantial decrease in prepayments of its fixed rate mortgage loans with rising interest rates  which may result in a lower level of proceeds available for reinvestment 
in addition to measuring the interest rate risk as a static gap measurement  the company also measures the impact on interest income with an instantaneous increase or decrease of interest rates of   and basis points 
this shock analysis is performed monthly 
a third measurement is used whereby interest rates are ramped over a one year time frame with increases and decreases of   and basis points 
management continues to upgrade its modeling techniques related to asset liability modeling 
results of the gap  shock and ramped interest risk analysis are reviewed by the board of directors 
in fiscal  the company intends to extend the weighted average maturity level of its fixed rate liabilities  including fhlb borrowings and certificates of deposit  to fund the asset portfolio diversification 
management anticipates that the effect of funding the origination and purchase of an increasing portfolio of multi family real estate  multi family construction and commercial nonresidential loans with such liabilities will be to lessen the company s negative gap position 
also  the origination and purchase of such assets normally carry more desirable interest rate repricing features as compared to the company s experience with one to four family mortgage lending 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of arm loans and mortgage backed and related securities in the company s portfolios could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinance activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
asset liability management schedule the following table sets forth at june  the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the time periods indicated  based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes thereto

balances have been reduced for undisbursed loan proceeds  unearned credit insurance premiums  deferred loan fees  purchased loan discounts and the allowance for loan losses  which aggregated million at june  although the company s negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts generally are subject to immediate withdrawal  management considers a certain historical amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer effective maturities and times to repricing based on the company s historical retention of such deposits in changing interest rate environments 
now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts are assumed to be withdrawn at annual rates of  and  respectively  of the declining balance of such accounts during the period shown 
the withdrawal rates used are higher than the company s historical rates but are considered by management to be more indicative of expected withdrawal rates currently 
if all of the company s now accounts  passbook savings accounts and money market deposit accounts had been assumed to be subject to repricing within one year  the one year cumulative deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities would have been million or of total assets 
adjustable and floating rate borrowings are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a derivative financial instrument includes futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company currently does not enter into futures  forwards  swaps or options 
however  the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the company
