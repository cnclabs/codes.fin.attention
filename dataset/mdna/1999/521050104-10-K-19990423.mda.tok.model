results of operations the company substantially consummated the acquisition of stanley mining services pty  limited stanley at the end of july  the stanley acquisition 
stanley has been reflected in layne christensen s results of operations beginning august  the stanley acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and will have a significant effect on layne christensen s future operations and on comparisons of income and expense items between periods  after the date of acquisition and prior 
among other things  the company has incurred a substantial increase in long term debt and goodwill and will incur a substantial increase in interest expense and goodwill amortization in the current and future periods 
with the stanley acquisition and other smaller acquisitions thereafter  the percentage of the company s revenues and operating income tied to the mining industry has increased substantially 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services and products depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely 
in this connection  the decline in the prices of various metals has continued to adversely impact the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies and has had  and could continue to have  a material adverse effect on the company 
the following table  which is derived from the company s consolidated financial statements as discussed in item  presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship which certain items reflected in the company s statements of income bear to revenues and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amount of such items period to period

comparison of fiscal to fiscal results of operations revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  compared to  for fiscal water well drilling and maintenance revenues increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the increase in water well drilling and maintenance revenues was primarily the result of the acquisition of certain assets of hydro group  inc  a new jersey based drilling contractor  in march the hydro acquisition 
additionally  the company experienced stronger demand for services at various domestic locations 
mineral exploration drilling revenues decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of lower demand for the company s services as a result of the decrease in exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies

the timmins project  which was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  geotechnical drilling revenues increased in fiscal the increase in the base geotechnical business revenues was primarily a result of increased activity in this market 
environmental drilling revenue increased to  for fiscal compared to revenues of  for fiscal the company believes the improvement was largely attributable to an increase in the number of larger and more technically demanding projects  which were substantially completed during the year 
product sales decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the decrease was a result of the lower demand for the company s services in the mining industry as previously discussed

income tax expense was  for fiscal compared to  in fiscal the effective tax rate for the year ended january  increased to compared to for the year ended january  this was primarily a result of a combination of a reduction in the amount of equity in earnings of foreign affiliates on which income tax is normally not provided as foreign tax credits are generally available to offset the tax liability and the increased impact of certain non deductible expenses resulting from lower earnings for the fiscal year 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal results of operations revenues for fiscal were  a increase compared to  for fiscal water well drilling and maintenance revenues increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of the acquisition of a louisiana drilling company and strong demand for these services in certain central and southern areas of the united states 
mineral exploration drilling revenues increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of the stanley acquisition combined with the company s recent expansion into africa 
geotechnical drilling revenues increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the timmins project 
excluding the timmins project  geotechnical drilling revenues increased for the year due to increased market penetration of the geotechnical drilling market 
product sales increased for fiscal to  from  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of strong demand for the company s mineral exploration drill rigs and related products 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues remained constant at for each of the years ended january  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increases in these expenses were primarily a result of the stanley acquisition 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of additional borrowings to finance the stanley acquisition 
equity in earnings of foreign affiliates decreased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of difficult weather conditions in chile and peru  as well as lower demand for drilling products and services due to depressed minerals prices 
income taxes increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  as a result of higher income before taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for both years 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large drilling contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to drilling sites and the ability to drill  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year

under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
year discussion the year yk problem relates to the fact that many computer programs use only two digits to refer to a year 
as a result  many computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the yk issue 
the company believes that issues related to yk compliance of its information technology it and non information technology non it systems should not have a material adverse impact on its business operations or financial results 
further  the company believes that the estimated costs of yk compliance will not be material 
other than the company s financial reporting systems  the nature of the company s business is such that it is generally not reliant upon date sensitive it and non it systems 
readiness in the fall of  the company initiated efforts to become yk compliant 
these efforts included  in part  a review of six types of it and non it systems that the company believed might be subject to the yk issue 
the identified systems included personal computers  networks  mainframes  telecommunication equipment  automated control manufacturing equipment and facility security environmental control equipment 
the review conducted by the company evaluated the operating systems  application software and it and non it hardware used in each of the six types of identified systems 
the company estimates that approximately of its yk testing and remediation plan has been completed 
the company expects to complete the balance of its yk testing and remediation plan by the end of the second quarter of in conducting its business  the company does not rely upon a limited number of third party vendors or customers 
no single vendor or customer accounts for more than of the company s purchases or sales  respectively 
in addition  there are generally a number of alternative vendors from which the company can obtain its supplies and services 
as a result  the company does not believe that yk problems experienced by third parties will have a material adverse impact on the company s business operations or financial results 
nevertheless  the company is in the process of conducting a review of the yk readiness of its major vendors both of products and services and customers 
the company s belief that it will not be adversely impacted by the yk readiness of third parties with which it conducts business is based not only upon the number and diversity of its customer and vendor base but also upon the yk compliance that is anticipated to be achieved by the majority of its customers and vendors 
in light of the fact that the company s position is based  in part  upon information supplied by third parties  there is of necessity an element of uncertainty in the company s assessment 
costs the company is primarily relying upon internal resources to implement its yk readiness plan and to upgrade and or replace it and non it systems that the company believes might be subject to the yk issue 
accordingly  much of the cost associated with its yk efforts have been incurred through the reallocation of the company s internal resources 
over approximately the past three fiscal years through the end of its fiscal year ended january   the company has expended approximately million in allocated internal resources and incremental costs for routine it and non it hardware and software replacements 
all of these hardware and software replacements have been yk compliant 
the company will continue its routine upgrading of it and non it hardware and software during calendar  all of which will also be yk compliant 
the estimated costs of allocated internal resources and routine systems upgrades during the year ending january  will be approximately  the company believes that the prospective costs of yk compliance will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
this conclusion is based  in part  upon the company s belief that it will not incur significant yk related costs on behalf of third parties with which the company conducts business 
the company expects cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund the costs associated with yk compliance 
risks as the nature of the company s business is such that it is not generally dependent upon date sensitive data for the production of its goods and services  the company believes that any problems associated with the yk issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business operations or financial results 
in spite of these presumptions  the inherent uncertainty associated with the yk issue makes it impossible for the company to reach a definitive conclusion as to the actual impact of the yk issue on its business operations and financial results 
as a result  the company will continue to review and update  where necessary  its yk strategy and to develop yk contingency plans 
further  the costs and timetables in which the company plans to complete the yk readiness activities  as well as potential outcomes of non compliance  are based on management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived using numerous assumptions as to the occurrence of future events  including actions by third parties over which the company has no control 
contingency plans the company s yk efforts are ongoing and its overall plan  as well as consideration of contingency plans where applicable  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
currently  the company believes that internal yk problems  should any occur  could be addressed through the use of alternative resources and manual processes without a significant interruption in the company s business operations 
further  the company believes that the nature of its business does not make it exclusively reliant upon a limited number of third party vendors or customers 
in addition  the company believes that third party vendor yk problems  should any occur  could be mitigated by utilizing alternative third party resources without adversely impacting the company s business operations or financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rates on variable rate debt  equity risk on investments  and foreign exchange rates giving rise to translation and transaction gains and losses 
the company centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
the company uses derivative financial instruments as part of its overall strategies 
a description of these instruments  as well as the company s variable rate debt  is described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on page of this form k 
assuming january  debt levels  an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s interest expense by  compared to  assuming january  debt levels 
the company s investments are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on page of this form k 
the investments are carried at market value and are held for long term investing purposes rather than trading purposes 
operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada  indonesia and thailand 
the operations are described in notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on pages and  respectively  of this form k 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted operating income for the years ended january  and by approximately  and  respectively 
this represents approximately ten percent of the international segment operating profit after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated statements of income reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican subsidiary  which uses the us dollar as its functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses for  and were not significant
