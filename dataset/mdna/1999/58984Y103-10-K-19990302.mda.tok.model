liquidity and capital resources prior to the merger and related transactions  capstar s primary sources of liquidity were cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and funds from external borrowings and debt and equity offerings 
capstar s continuing operations were funded through cash generated from hotel operations 
hotel acquisitions and joint venture improvements were financed through a combination of internally generated cash  external borrowings and the issuance of op units and or common stock 
capstar did not pay dividends to stockholders 
following the merger and spin off  the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and funds from external borrowings and debt and equity offerings 
the company expects to fund its continuing operations through cash generated by its participating leases 
the company also expects to finance future hotel acquisitions and joint venture investments through a combination of internally generated cash  external borrowings and the issuance of op units and or common stock 
additionally  the company will be required  in order to maintain favorable tax treatment accorded to a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  to distribute to stockholders at least of its reit taxable income 
the company expects to fund such distributions through cash generated from operations or borrowings on the company s credit facility 
operating activities provided million of net cash for the year ended december  mainly due to higher levels of net income and depreciation and amortization 
the company used million of cash in investing activities for the year ended december   primarily for the acquisition of hotels and capital expenditures at the company s hotels and a note receivable from opco 
net cash provided by financing activities of million resulted primarily from net borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
in conjunction with the merger  capstar terminated its existing credit facility effective august   and the company entered into a billion senior secured credit facility the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is structured as a million  five year term loan facility  a million  five and a half year term loan facility  and a million  three year revolving credit facility with two one year optional extensions 
the interest rate on the term loans and revolving facility ranges from to basis points over day libor  depending on certain financial performance covenants and long term senior unsecured debt ratings

as of december   the company had available million under the new credit facility s revolving facility 
effective august   the company also entered into a million secured facility secured facility  which is expected to be converted into a commercial mortgage backed security secured by hotels 
the interest rate on the secured facility is basis points over day libor 
the weighted average interest rate on the secured facility as of december  was 
capital for renovation work has historically been and is expected to continue to be provided by a combination of internally generated cash and external borrowings 
once initial renovation programs for a hotel are completed  the company expects to spend approximately annually of hotel revenues for ongoing capital expenditure programs  including room and facilities refurbishment s  renovations  and furniture and equipment replacements 
for the year ended december   the company spent including expenditures by both capstar and agh prior to the merger million on initial renovation and ongoing capital expenditure programs 
the company expects to spend million in  with million used for renovations and million in recurring refurbishment projects 
the company believes cash generated by operations  together with anticipated borrowing capacity under the new credit facility  will be sufficient to fund its existing working capital  ongoing capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
the company believes  however  that its future capital decisions will also be made in response to specific acquisition and or investment opportunities  depending on conditions in the capital and or other financial markets 
accordingly  the company may consider increasing its borrowing capacity or issuing additional debt or equity securities  the proceeds of which could be used to finance acquisitions or investments  or to refinance existing debt 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
demand is lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during peak travel season 
accordingly  the company s operations are seasonal in nature  with lower participating lease payments to the company in the first and fourth quarters and higher participating lease payments to the company in the second and third quarters 
year conversion the company is in the process of conducting a review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year problem and has initiated an implementation plan to address the problem 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  this could result in a major systems failure or miscalculations 
the company s hotel properties contain various information technology and embedded technology systems 
both types of systems contain microprocessors and microcontrollers that must be assessed for year compliance 
the company has developed a comprehensive implementation plan to address the potential year problems caused by such systems 
this plan involves six stages increase awareness of issue  assign responsibility for coordinating response to issue  information collection  analysis  modification  repair or replacement  and testing 
the company is currently in its analysis stage  and expects to complete this stage by march the subsequent stages are expected to be completed as follows modification  repair or replacement june  and testing august as an additional part of its implementation plan to address the year problem  the company has also initiated communications with third parties with which it has material relationships to determine the extent of potential year problems with these parties services provided to the company 
the most critical of these services involve such items as reservations systems for the company s hotels 
without such systems  the company could suffer a material decline in business at many of its properties 
the company expects to complete its communications and assessment of these outside parties services by march also  the company expects to develop contingency plans in to allow for manual or other alternative operation of certain computerized systems  in the event that modification  repair  and replacement efforts are not completed timely 
the company anticipates completing its year implementation plan no later than august   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
historical costs incurred to address the year problem include approximately million 
the company has not yet developed a final cost estimate related to fixing year issues  but an initial estimate of these remediation costs for its properties is million 
this cost estimate is based on the company s preliminary assessment  and will be refined and adjusted as the company continues to complete the stages of its implementation plan to address the potential year problems 
based on its preliminary assessment  the company believes that its risks of year non compliance that is  its most reasonably likely worst case scenario  with modifications to existing software and converting to new software  will not pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems as so modified and converted 
if  however  such modifications and conversions are not completed timely  the year problem could have a material impact on the company s financial position and operations 
the company s operations are highly dependent upon participating lease revenue earned from the lessees of its properties 
these participating lease revenue amounts are based upon revenues generated at the leased properties 
to the extent that the year problems materially affect the conduct of operations at those properties  it is likely that those lessees revenues would be affected  and that the company s participating lease revenues would ultimately be affected
