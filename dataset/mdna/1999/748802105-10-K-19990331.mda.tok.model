item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations results of operations note all dollar amounts are in thousands vs 
net sales   increase decrease in the company experienced record net sales  principally due to record sales of its core products  stackers and bottomwrappers 
gross profit   increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in gross profit was principally the result of an improved sales mix and continued manufacturing cost control programs 
the company s core products have a higher gross profit margin than ancillary products such as twin track  floor equipment or oem original equipment manufacturers 
the improved gross profit margin was partially offset by a reclassification of bad debt allowances of  to product cost contingencies contract reserves 
cost contingencies are anticipated future additional costs that may be incurred after equipment is shipped and installed  the customer has been invoiced and revenue is recorded 
the company records cost contingencies to match possible future expenses with related revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses   increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was principally due to legal and accounting fees incurred in connection with an aborted business combination and patent infringement litigation that the company brought against another company  which was settled during the increase was offset in part by a reclassification of bad debt expense to product cost contingencies  which is included in cost of goods sold 
research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in research and development expenditures from to principally related to improvement of the company s gripper conveyor and the development of a palletizer 
operating income   increase decrease percentage of net sales the decrease in the operating income  as compared to  was principally a result of increases in research and development and selling  general and administrative costs  offset by the increase in gross profit 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income remained relatively stable 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in other income and expense net was a result of increases in interest income resulting from higher interest rates and higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
results of operations note all dollar amounts are in thousands vs 
net sales   increase decrease  the increase in net sales reflects growth in the domestic market 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in international sales  caused by a significant decline in sales to the far east 
management believes that sales in the far east were adversely affected by general economic difficulties in the region 
gross profit   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the increase in gross profit was the result of an increase in sales volume 
as a percent of net sales  gross profit remained stable  despite a higher mix of original equipment manufactured products which generally have lower margins 
this stability is the result of increased manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses   increase decrease percentage of net sales the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from increases in commissions and in freight  warranty and trade show expenses 
these expenses are generally related to the level of company sales  and the increase reflects the higher sales volume 
research and development increase decrease percentage of net sales research and development expenditures remained essentially unchanged 
increased sales volume led to a decrease in research and development expenditures as a percentage of net sales 
operating income   increase decrease  percentage of net sales the increase in operating income resulted from increased gross profit and economies of scale in connection with expenses that are not significantly affected by increased sales volume 
other income and expense net increase decrease percentage of net sales the net increase in other income is principally due to an increase in interest income 
higher cash balances throughout the year had a positive effect on interest income 
in  the company invested largely in tax free securities 
investments in these instruments generally contribute less to income before income tax than taxable instruments 
however  investments in tax free instruments contributed more to net income after tax income than would taxable instruments that the company deemed suitable for investment 
interest obligations on indebtedness partially offset the increase in the interest income 
year disclosure the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
in other words  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has been engaged in an evaluation of its year readiness in connection with its information technology and non information technology systems 
in addition  the company has analyzed its products as they relate to the year issue 
the company has also attempted to analyze year issues relating to third parties with whom the company has a business relationship 
the current status of the company s efforts is as follows internal systems and products information technology systems the company s manufacturing and accounting software supplier has advised the company that year support of mapics was implemented in and that the company s manufacturing and accounting software is year compliant 
in addition  the company s as operating system has been upgraded and the company has received correspondence from the vendor that this software is year compliant 
to confirm year compliance  the company began testing of its manufacturing  accounting and operating system during the fourth quarter of the company s manufacturing department was using a computerized data collection system to record labor time and attendance 
this system was not year compliant 
the company replaced the software and related hardware in february with software and hardware that is certified by the manufacturer to be year compliant 
non information technology systems the company s heating  cooling  ventilation and alarm systems include microprocessor based components 
the heating  cooling and ventilation systems providers have advised the company that these systems are not date sensitive 
the alarm company was unable to provide assurance of year compliance for the alarm 
therefore  the alarm system was replaced in november with a system certified by the manufacturer to be compliant 
products the company s products are not materially date sensitive 
moreover  products currently manufactured that have time and date functions are year compliant 
therefore  the company does not believe it has any material exposure with regard to its products as a result of the year issue 
year issues relating to third parties vendors the company utilizes approximately vendors to supply parts  materials and components for its various products 
the company has surveyed its major vendors regarding their year status 
several vendors supplied letters to the company stating that they are either year compliant or that they will be year compliant by december  however  the company is unable to verify this information and it is possible that advice received from vendors may be erroneous 
moreover  certain vendors have not responded to the company s request for information and may not be year compliant 
nevertheless  the company believes alternative sources of supply are available for all required components 
therefore  absent widespread difficulties effecting several critical vendors  the company does not anticipate that vendors year issues would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  certain machine parts could be manufactured in the company s in house machine shop 
the company has received verbal verification from several of its freight providers that they are year compliant 
however  the company is not currently aware of the year readiness of certain outside service companies  such as telecommunications or utility providers 
the failure of these providers to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company  which is not currently quantifiable 
in the worst case  the company s operations could be seriously disrupted 
customers the company s customer base typically changes significantly from year to year 
since the company s equipment is designed to have an extended life  significant repeat orders are not received on a regular basis 
as a result  the company is unable to predict the identity of most of its major customers in the year and thereafter 
the company is unable to make an inquiry as to whether the customers computer driven payment or purchasing processes are year compliant 
a customer s year issues could cause a delay in receipt of purchase orders or payment 
if year issues are widespread among the company s customers  the company s sales and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
market risk the company is exposed to various types of market risk  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because the company s cash and investments exceed short and long term debt  the exposure to interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolios 
due to the short term maturities of quipp s investments  management believes that there is no significant risks arising from interest rates fluctuations 
the company is actively managing the investment portfolios to increase return on investments  but  in order to ensure liquidity  will only invest in instruments with credit quality and where a secondary market exists 
the counterparties are major financial institutions and government agencies 
general the majority of the company s sales are made on a contract basis 
typically  a deposit is received upon the execution of the sales contract 
prior to shipment  additional payments are received  reducing the customer s balance due 
larger orders are normally received some months in advance of delivery 
therefore  backlog can be an important  though by no means conclusive  indication of the company s short term revenue stream 
the timing of revenues can be affected by pending orders  the amount of custom engineering required  the timetable for delivery  and the receipt and nature of new orders 
the backlog  as of december   and december   was  and  respectively 
the backlog consists of some oem products which generally have lower margins 
management believes all orders in the december  backlog will be satisfied by the end of liquidity and capital resources on december   cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaled  as compared to  at december   an increase of  this increase was principally related to cash provided by operations  an increase in deferred revenues of  and a reduction of  in inventory 
working capital at december  was  an increase of  from  at december  on may   the company will pay a special dividend of per share to shareholders of record on april  based on the number of shares outstanding on march  the company will distribute  this amount will increase if any outstanding stock options are exercised on or prior to april  the company believes that the remaining cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund operations at the current level 
inflation the rate of inflation has not had a material impact on operations 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k regarding the shipment of backlog during the next twelve months  the planned introduction of an improved gripper conveyor and a palletizer  third party statements regarding year readiness of their products  services and systems  consequences of the failure of the company s products and systems  and outside parties to be year compliant  and other year related matters are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements including  among others  economic conditions generally and specifically in the newspaper industry  change in product demand  delays in shipment  cancellation of customer orders  engineering and production difficulties relating to the gripper conveyor and palletizer  unanticipated hardware or software problems in connection with upgrades  unavailability of vendors to replace vendors having year difficulties  inability of the company to internally fabricate necessary machine parts and unanticipated costs of year measures
