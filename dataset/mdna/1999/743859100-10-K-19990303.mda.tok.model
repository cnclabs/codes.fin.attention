pmc  mutual funds  annuities and insurance products through provident investment center pic and leases through court square leasing and provident lease corp 
during  the corporation acquired first citizens financial corporation and the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  results for the reporting periods have been restated 
the corporation recorded net income in of million or per share diluted  a increase over before adjusting for merger related costs 
adjusting for merger costs  would have shown net income of million and per share diluted  giving an increase of million in net income and 
per share diluted over the prior year 
the growth in net earnings was attributable to an million rise in net interest income and million higher non interest income offset in part by higher provision for loan losses of million and a million increase in operating costs  net of merger expenses 
these variances are discussed in more detail beginning on the following pages 
results of operations net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
interest income  for purposes of analysis  is presented on a tax equivalent basis to recognize associated tax benefits 
this presentation provides a basis for comparison of yields with taxable earning assets 
the discussion on net interest income should be read in conjunction with table analysis of changes in net interest income and table consolidated average balances  interest income and expense and yields and rates 
tax equivalent net interest income for increased million  or  from as average earning assets grew million over the prior year 
net interest margin fell by basis points primarily caused by a lower interest rate environment and leveraging of million of trust preferred securities issued during the second quarter of these securities constitute additional capital for regulatory purposes and provide leveraging opportunities while not increasing shares outstanding 
provident s interest income increased million  or  during the year primarily due to the growth in average earning assets offset in part by a basis point decrease in yield 
the decrease in yield was mainly due to a lower rate environment and the leveraging of the trust preferred securities noted above 
the increase in average earning assets resulted from a million increase in the loan portfolios  million in investments and million in loans held for sale 
consumer loans grew million while the commercial business portfolio also experienced growth of million 
residential and commercial mortgage loans declined million and million  respectively  due to sales of mortgage loans and prepayments of commercial mortgages 
interest income earned on the loan portfolio increased million reflecting higher loan outstandings 
the yield on investments and loans decreased basis points and basis points  respectively 
interest lost from non accruing loans was thousand compared to thousand in interest expense increased million from resulting from a million growth in average interest bearing liabilities 
the overall cost of funds remained relatively flat as total interest bearing liabilities increased basis points mainly due to the use of brokered cds to fund asset growth 
the offset was due to the increase in non interest bearing liabilities 
excluding the effect of off balance sheet positions in each year  total costs of interest bearing liabilities would have increased basis points 
the average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased basis points during the increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflects a million rise in interest bearing deposits  million of which is associated with brokered deposits and million with money market certificates of deposit 
noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts grew by million or 
the corporation experienced a million increase in borrowed funds 
future growth in net interest income will depend upon consumer and commercial loan demand and the general level of interest rates

mortgage originations during the year increased million to billion 
provident investment center pic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank  offers annuities and mutual funds through an affiliation with a securities broker dealer 
for the year  income associated with these products increased by thousand to million 
this increase is attributed to continued sales efforts towards these products 
other non interest income increased million over this increase is primarily due to commercial loan fees tied to an increase in loan volumes and higher prepayment penalties 
cardholder income increased thousand associated with higher usage and gain on sale of fixed assets increased thousand due to sale of a bank building 
non interest expense non interest expense is composed primarily of costs associated with employees salaries and benefits  bank facilities and external data processing 
provident s non interest expense of million represented a million increase from expenses adjusted for merger related items

the rise in these categories is attributable to higher commissions and incentives of million related mainly to increased mortgage business 
regular salaries rose million mainly attributable to merit increases  increased staffing and recognition of expenses related to lending activities 
full time equivalent employees for the year were  compared to  last year 
occupancy costs rose thousand or over last year 
this increase is mainly due to additional rent and leasehold improvements as the branch network increased to branches in total furniture and equipment expense increased thousand due to upgrading of technology in the bank s office automation and branch platform systems 
external processing increased million  or  associated with increase in account volume 
the year includes capital securities expense of million associated with the million trust preferred securities offering during the second quarter of all other non interest expenses were up by million from this increase is connected to higher marketing expenses of million and communication and postage expenses of thousand resulting from the branch network acquired in the merger of first citizens financial corporation savings bank  and higher employment advertising costs of thousand 
impact of the year issue management initiated the process of preparing computer systems and applications for the year in september the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions 
the corporation is currently in the testing phase using both internal and external resources to test the software and hardware for year compliance 
the corporation plans to finish testing by june  and intends to reprogram  or replace  software and hardware  to the extent necessary 
testing to date has not led to any adverse events 
the corporation intends to be year compliant by june  the corporation relies on m i services  a third party processor for the majority of its data processing requirements 
provident is working with all of its significant data processing software and hardware suppliers  to make certain they will be year compliant 
a due diligence approach is being used to develop general risk control guidelines to assist in identifying material customers  evaluating their preparedness  assessing year customer risk and implementing controls to manage the risk 
the total costs associated with becoming year compliant are expected to be less than million and are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
as of december   the corporation had spent approximately thousand to become year compliant 
money to fund year compliance will come from normal operating cash flow 
expenses associated with year compliance will directly reduce otherwise reported net income of the corporation in the period incurred 
as a precaution  the corporation has developed a contingency plan in case it is not completely year compliant after december  management believes the contingency plan will permit provident  even if some of its systems fail  to continue to operate until normal operations can be restored 
these plans include the capability to process off line and transport the data to our third party processor by the most effective and efficient means available 
these procedures could require changing schedules and hiring of temporary staff  which would increase the cost of the operations 
the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios foreseeable at this time would include the bank temporarily not being able to process  in some combination  various types of customer transactions 
despite provident s efforts to date to remediate affected systems and develop contingency plans for potential risks  management has not yet completed all activities associated with resolving year issues 
under the unlikely scenario that required modifications or conversions are not made or are not completed on a timely basis prior to the year  normal business operations could be disrupted 
in addition  noncompliance by third parties including loan customers and disruptions to the economy in general resulting from year issues could also have a negative impact of undeterminable magnitude on the corporation 
the costs of the project and the date on which the corporation plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
income taxes provident recorded income tax expense of million on pre tax income of million for an effective tax rate of 
this compares with a effective tax rate for this decrease is related to permanent tax differences associated with the merger of first citizens financial corporation during fourth quarter results provident recorded net income of million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  in the fourth quarter of  an increase of million  or  over the million  or 
per share on a diluted basis  recorded in the same period last year 
the higher earnings are principally due to a increase in tax equivalent net interest income and higher non interest income 
a higher loan loss provision and a rise in operating expenses partially offset these increases 
tax equivalent net interest income in the fourth quarter rose million to million as the net interest margin declined basis points to and average earning assets grew million to billion 
the decrease in the net interest margin primarily reflected a flatter yield curve along with a lower rate environment as yield on earning assets declined more than the drop in the costs of funds 
the corporation recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the quarter to provide for loan growth in the portfolio as well as to more fully provide for an adverse decision in a lawsuit relating to a letter of credit see note 
non interest income increased percent to million 
the increase is derived from fee based services as a result of higher account volumes  increased mortgage banking business  security gains and increased loan fees 
fee income from deposit accounts increased million and net security gains increased million 
mortgage banking income increased million as originations were million compared to million for the same period in and loan fees increased thousand 
non interest expense increased million to million 
compensation and benefits increased million much of which is associated with increased mortgage business 
furniture and equipment expense was thousand higher due to network expansion and upgrading of branch technology

financial condition source and use of funds deposits a major portion of provident s funding comes from core deposits which consists of consumer and commercial transaction accounts and consumer savings and time deposits 
these deposits are generated through the bank s branch banking locations 
at december   core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities 
provident s future funding growth is expected to be generated from deposit growth through strategies outlined below 
the branch network strategy includes traditional full service branch locations supplemented with in store branches 
in store branch locations are comprised of supermarket locations and national retail superstores 
provident bank of maryland as of december  had traditional branch locations and in store branches 
the corporation has an agreement with rich food corporation to operate branches in their metro and basic supermarkets in the baltimore metropolitan area 
provident will selectively look for additional branch opportunities complementary to existing locations when the cost of entry is reasonable 
the corporation has five additional in store branches and one new traditional branch planned for provident continues to attract increased commercial and retail deposits 
interest bearing demand money market deposit balances at december  were up million  or  compared to year end the bank also operates seven fast n friendly check cashing centers 
the purpose of the check cashing centers is to offer alternative banking services to a segment of our market place that does not utilize traditional banking services

during  average deposits grew million  or  compared to average money market demand deposits and noninterest bearing deposits increased million or 
this growth reflects provident s emphasis on full banking relationships with its retail and commercial customers 
average time deposits increased million  or  million of which is attributable to brokered deposits and million in money market certificates of deposit 
brokered deposits  often a cheaper source of funds compared to other available sources of borrowed money such as federal home loan bank advances and repurchase agreements  are used to match fund investments and acquired loans 
the table below presents information at december   with respect to the maturity of certificates of deposit of  or more 
deposit maturities table maturities over three over six three months months to months to over dollars in thousands or less six months months months total balance      percent of total credit risk management much of the fundamental business of provident is based upon understanding  measuring and controlling credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risk  which is inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit loss 
for example  loans with generally low credit loss experience include home mortgage and home equity loans 
loans with medium credit loss experience are primarily secured products such as auto and marine loans 
the category with high credit loss experience includes unsecured products such as personal revolving credit 
in commercial lending  losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can vary widely from period to period and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
the evaluation of specific risk is a basic function of underwriting and loan administration  involving analysis of the borrower s ability to service debt as well as the value of pledged collateral 
policies and procedures have been developed which specify the appropriate credit approval and monitoring for the various types of credit offered 
the bank employs prudent lending practices and adheres to regulatory requirements including loan to value ratios and legal lending limits 
these procedures are modified periodically in order to reflect changing conditions and new products 
the bank s lending and loan administration staffs are charged with reviewing the loan portfolio  identifying changes in the economy or in a borrower s circumstances which may affect the ability to repay debt or the value of pledged collateral 
in order to assess and monitor the degree of risk in the loan portfolio  credit risk identification and review processes are utilized 
credit risk analysis assigns a grade to each commercial loan based upon an assessment of the borrower s financial capacity to service the debt and the presence and value of collateral for the loan 
an independent loan review function tests risk assessment and determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
financial accounting standards require creditors to evaluate the collectibility of contractually due principal and interest on commercial credits to assess the need for providing for losses 
the corporation s credit procedures require monitoring of commercial credits to determine the collectibility of such credits 
if a loan is identified as impaired  it will be placed on non accrual status and recorded according to accounting guidelines 
as of december   there were million in commercial loans considered to be impaired

provident s residential mortgage lending includes the origination  sale and servicing of fixed and variable rate mortgage loans 
loans are originated through the loan production offices of provident mortgage corp 
financial accounting standards for mortgage banking enterprises that acquire mortgage servicing rights  and sell or securitize those loans with servicing retained  require the allocation of the cost of the mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and the loans 
mortgage origination activity in showed a significant increase as originations totaled billion in compared to million in during  income from the sale of loans was million 
the mortgage servicing portfolio ended the year at million 
the residential real estate mortgage loan balance at december  was million compared to million at the end of the prior year

hlts are loans to borrowers for the purpose of purchasing or recapitalizing a business in which the loans represent a majority of the borrower s liabilities 
hlts totaled million as of year end  and all are performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  renegotiated loans and real estate and other assets that have been acquired through foreclosure or repossession 
past due loans are loans that are days or more past due as of december and still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection 
the corporation does not place consumer loans on non accrual status as delinquent consumer loan outstandings and any uncollected interest are generally charged off at the time they would be placed on non accrual status 
information with respect to non performing assets and past due loans is presented in table for the years indicated 
as shown in the table  total non accrual loans increased million  mainly in the residential construction portfolio 
the increase in past due consumer loans is a result of a million  or  growth in the consumer loan portfolio  the majority of which is secured by residential real estate

beginning in  consumer loans are not placed in non accrual status but are generally charged off at days past due for installment loans and days for revolving loans 
this was done to conform to standard industry practice 
allowance for loan losses provident maintains an allowance for loan losses which is available to absorb potential losses 
the allowance is reduced by actual credit losses and is increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries of previous losses 
determination of the adequacy of the allowance  which is performed quarterly  is accomplished by assigning specific reserves to individually identified problem credits and general reserves  based on historic and anticipated loss experience  to all other loans 
the following table reflects the allowance for possible loan losses and the activity during each of the respective years

allowance for loan losses to year end loans the continued emphasis on loan quality and close monitoring of potential problem credits has resulted in a strong credit portfolio 
senior managers meet at least monthly to review the credit quality of the loan portfolios and at least quarterly with executive management to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is determined by management s evaluation of the composition and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
based upon the evaluation of credit risk  loan loss provisions in the form of charges to operations  are made to bring the allowance up to a level management believes is adequate 
an analysis of the loan portfolio was performed at december   and expected losses have been provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
during  the loan loss allowance increased million to million at year end 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to at december  in april of  a judgment stemming from a lawsuit alleging that provident bank of maryland had failed to fully honor a letter of credit in was entered against provident in the amount of million  exclusive of post judgment interest

at year end  core deposits represented billion  or  of total liabilities and of total assets 
an important element in liquidity management is the availability of borrowed funds 
at december   short term borrowings totaled million  or  of liabilities in contrast to million  or  of liabilities at december  this decrease was the result of greater utilization of the broker cd market and the money market cd product to match fund assets 
brokered cds at december  amounted to billion  a million increase from the same period last year 
money market cds totaled million at december   a million increase from the prior year end 
the average maturity of short term borrowings at the end of the current year was days 
these borrowings are fully collateralized by us government or mortgage backed securities owned by the bank 
long term borrowings consisted of variable and fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank and totaled million as of december  it is anticipated that provident will continue to have access to the repurchase market and fed fund lines as well as short and long term variable and fixed rate funds from the federal home loan bank 
during the second quarter of  the corporation issued million of trust preferred securities with a maturity of years  callable at the end of the tenth year 
the rate on the trust preferred securities is 
interest sensitivity management the nature of the banking business  which involves paying interest on deposits at varying rates and terms and charging interest on loans at other rates and terms  creates interest rate risk 
as a result  earnings are subject to fluctuations which arise due to changes in the level and directions of interest rates 
management s objective is to minimize this risk 
measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process which is performed regularly as an important component of management s analysis of the impact of changes in asset and liability portfolios 
control of provident s interest sensitivity position is accomplished through the structuring of the investment and funding portfolios  securitizing loans for possible sale  the use of variable rate loan products and off balance sheet derivatives 
management does not try to anticipate changes in interest rates 
its principal objective is to maintain interest margins in periods of both rising and falling rates 
traditional interest sensitivity gap analyses alone do not adequately measure an institution s exposure to changes in interest rates because gap models are not sensitive to changes in the relationship between interest rates charged or paid and do not incorporate balance sheet trends and management actions 
each of these factors can affect an institution s earnings 
accordingly  in addition to performing gap analysis  management also evaluates the impact of differing interest rates on net interest income using an earnings simulation model 
the model incorporates the factors not captured by gap analysis by projecting income over a twelve month horizon under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
as of december   provident s interest sensitive liabilities exceeded interest sensitive assets within a one year period by billion  or of assets 
the bank s savings products are structured to give management the ability to reset the rates paid on a monthly basis 
this causes the bank to become more liability sensitive 
if interest rates rise  the rate paid on savings deposits may follow  and the corporation s net interest margin may decline 
management continues to take steps to protect the bank from possible increases in interest rates 
in  these steps included lengthening the maturities on purchased funds and certificates of deposits and shortening asset maturities with interest rate swaps and caps 
management monitors the interest rate environment and employs appropriate off balance sheet strategies to address potential changes in interest rates 
these strategies lower the net interest margin but are designed to maintain an acceptable margin in a changing rate environment 
as a result of off balance sheet transactions undertaken to insulate the bank from interest rate risks  interest income increased by thousand and interest expense decreased by thousand  for a total increase of million in net interest income for the year ending december  included in this net interest income increase was the amortization of closed positions which reduced interest income by thousand and increased interest expense by million a net decrease of million for the quarter 
without the amortization of closed positions  off balance sheet positions increased net interest income million for the year 
management was assuming for planning purposes as of december   that short term rates will decrease by basis points and long term rates will increase by basis points over the next twelve months 
the corporation s analysis indicates that if management does not adjust its december  off balance sheet positions and the forward yield curve assumptions occur  off balance sheet positions  including amortization of closed positions  would increase net interest income by million over the next twelve months 
this compares to an increase of million should interest rates remain unchanged 
amortization of closed positions will increase net interest income by million over the next twelve months 
thus  without amortization of closed positions  net interest income would increase thousand over the next twelve months if the forward yield curve assumptions occur and million if rates remain unchanged 
stockholders equity it is necessary for banks to maintain a sufficient level of capital in order to sustain growth  absorb unforeseen losses and meet regulatory requirements 
in addition  the current economic and regulatory climate places an increased emphasis on capital strength 
in this environment  provident continues to maintain a strong capital position 
provident is well capitalized  exceeding all regulatory requirements as of december   see note regulatory capital 
at december   total stockholders equity was million  a million increase over the prior year 
in addition to the ordinary adjustments to stockholders equity of net income and dividends paid  additional capital of thousand was raised through the dividend reinvestment plan  million from the exercise of stock options  while capital increased by thousand during as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
this statement requires changes in market value  net of applicable income taxes  of the available for sale investment portfolio to be accounted for through equity 
an additional component of regulatory capital are the capital securities issued in these securities are treated as tier i capital even though they are not included in stockholders equity in the consolidated statement of condition 
during  the corporation also repurchased  shares totaling million 
in the second quarter of  the corporation issued a stock dividend and all earnin gs per share figures have been adjusted for this dividend and the for stock split in february provident exceeds all regulatory capital requirements as of december  the standards used by federal bank regulators to evaluate capital adequacy are the risk based capital and leverage ratio guidelines 
equity for regulatory purposes does not include market value adjustments as required by sfas no 
risk based capital ratios measure core and total stockholders equity against risk weighted assets 
provident s core capital is equal to its common stock  capital surplus and retained earnings less treasury stock 
the calculation of provident s total stockholders equity  for these purposes  is equal to the above plus the allowance for loan losses subject to certain limitations 
risk weighted assets are determined by applying a weighting to asset categories and certain off balance sheet commitments based on the level of credit risk inherent in the assets 
at december   provident s total capital ratio was compared to the minimum regulatory guideline of 
in addition  core common stockholders equity tier capital must be at least of risk weighted assets 
at year end  provident s tier capital ratio was 
the leverage ratio represents core capital  as defined above  divided by average total assets 
guidelines for the leverage ratio require the ratio of core stockholders equity to average total assets to be to basis points above a minimum  depending on risk profiles and other factors 
provident s leverage ratio of at december  was well in excess of this requirement 
capital components and ratios table december  dollars in thousands qualifying capital tier capital   total capital   risk weighted assets   quarterly average assets   ratios leverage capital tier capital total capital financial review for the year ended december   provident recorded net income of million or per share diluted net of merger related costs  net income was million or per share diluted basis  compared to million or per share diluted basis in the per share amounts have been adjusted for stock dividends and a for stock split in february this improvement in earnings was attributable to a million rise in net interest income  lower provision for loan losses and a million decrease in operating costs  net of merger expenses 
these were partially offset by a million decrease in non interest income 
tax equivalent net interest income for increased million  or  from as average earning assets grew million over the prior year 
net interest margin grew by basis points primarily caused by an million increase in noninterest bearing liabilities 
the provision for loan losses  net of the merger related portion  decreased million to million in during the corporation incurred a million write off attributed to a single commercial credit 
without this write off  the provision in would have been approximately million 
total loans outstanding grew by million 
total non interest income decreased to million 
excluding net securities gains losses  non interest income decreased million or  primarily due to lower mortgage banking income 
deposit service charges rose over due to a million increase in retail demand deposit service fees  million increase in atm fees and a thousand increase in commercial deposit fees 
interest bearing demand money market deposits grew million or over while noninterest bearing deposits increased million or income from mortgage banking activities decreased million  million due to lower gains on the sale of mortgage servicing rights  million in lower gains from sale of mortgage loans and million from lower origination income 
mortgage originations during declined million to million 
the changes resulted primarily from the interruptions of closing sales offices and shifting to a more indirect origination business 
income associated with products sold through provident investment center increased by thousand to million 
loan fees increased thousand from  all associated with retail loan fees 
this increase is tied to an increase in loan volume 
provident s non interest expense of million net of merger expenses represented a decrease from salaries and benefits decreased million during compensation decreased thousand while benefits were down thousand 
the decline in these categories is attributable to the change in the mortgage banking business from predominately retail to wholesale and savings associated with the merger 
occupancy costs grew thousand  or  during this increase is mainly due to additional rent and leasehold improvements as the branch network increased to branches in total furniture and equipment expense increased thousand due to upgrading of technology in the bank s office automation and branch platform systems 
external processing increased million  or  associated with increased account volume 
regulatory fees declined million  mainly associated with a one time saif special assessment of million paid by first citizens financial corporation in the third quarter of provident recorded income tax expense in of million on pre tax income of million for an effective tax rate of 
this compares with a effective tax rate for this increase is related to permanent tax differences associated with the merger of first citizens financial corporation offset in part by a lower effective state income tax rate
