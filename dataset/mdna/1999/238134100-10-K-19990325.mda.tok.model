item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general collaborative operates two separate businesses within the clinical research industry 
through its clinical business  the company operates a multi specialty smo that provides clinical research services to companies in the clinical pharmaceutical  biotechnology  cro and medical device research industries 
through datatrak  the company provides edc and other services to assist sponsors in accelerating the completion of clinical trials 
datatrak had no revenue prior to on december   the company signed the agreement with west providing for the sale of assets of the company related to the clinical business 
the sale is subject to shareholder approval and  if approved  is expected to be completed by the end of april upon completion of the proposed sale  the company will no longer operate the clinical business 
the proposed sale would transfer substantially all of the company s backlog to west  and the company would no longer generate revenue from the operation of the clinical business 
consequently after the proposed sale  the datatrak business will be the sole source of the company s revenue  and approximately of the company s assets  or approximately million  will be held in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
after the proposed sale  the company anticipates that datatrak s operating results will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
there can be no assurance of datatrak s long term future prospects 
the discussion that follows highlights the business conditions and certain financial information specific to each of the company s two business segments 
clinical business 
the clinical business provides services to three segments of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
through wce  it provides clinical research services relating to the reclassification of prescription drugs into drugs available for otc purchase and other otc services 
in addition  the clinical business provides phase i research services from its bed clinic at gfi 
finally  through its affiliated site network which is comprised of six therapeutically focused sub networks drawn from over affiliated research sites affiliated sites  it provides phase ii  iii  and iv research services 
the company has no ownership interest in any of its affiliated sites 
the clinical business enters into contracts that provide a fixed price for each component or service delivered 
the ultimate contract value depends on such variables as the number of research sites selected  patients enrolled and other services required by the sponsor 
generally  these contracts range in duration from several months to several years 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  revenue is earned under the percentage of completion method utilizing units of delivery 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
pass through costs that are paid directly by sponsors  and for which the company does not bear the risk of economic loss  are excluded from revenue 
these clinical trial costs can include investigator meeting fees  irb fees and travel costs 
the termination of a contract results in no material adjustments to revenue or direct costs previously recognized  and the company is entitled to payment for all work performed through the date of notice of termination and all costs associated with termination of a study 
contracts in the clinical business may generally be terminated by the sponsor with or without cause 
some of the reasons clinical trials may be terminated include unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to the drug  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the drug or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or development efforts on a particular drug 
depending on the size of the trial  a sponsor s decision to terminate or delay the trial could have a material adverse effect on the company s backlog  future revenue and profitability 
the net loss of the clinical business was million  including a special items charge of  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   including special items and impairment charges totaling million 
the company s backlog at december   substantially all of which relates to the clinical business  was million  as compared to backlog of million at december  during  a large contract  which had not been performing as expected  together with several smaller contracts were removed from backlog 
the removal of these contracts reduced backlog by million 
the current backlog reflects the addition of million of new backlog during other miscellaneous contract adjustments had the effect of increasing backlog by million 
of the million backlog at december   the company expects that million will be converted to revenue subsequent to datatrak business 
collaborative s wholly owned subsidiary  datatrak  uses the software known as datatrak edc tm to provide edc and technology services to sponsors in order to assist in the more timely completion of clinical trials 
the company is currently developing this business  has recognized minimal revenue to date  and has experienced significant losses and negative cash flow from operations since beginning operations in datatrak had no operating results during during the year ended december   datatrak had no revenue and a net loss of million  including a special items charge of million 
for the year ended december   datatrak s net loss was million  including special items charges of  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving commercial acceptance of the datatrak r process 
datatrak contracts provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered 
services provided by datatrak that are in addition to those provided for in its contracts are billed on a fee for service basis for services completed 
generally  these contracts range in duration from twelve to eighteen months 
the ultimate contract value is dependent upon the length of the customers use of datatrak edc tm and the services provided by datatrak 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  revenue and direct costs of revenue are recognized under the percentage of completion method utilizing units of delivery 
costs associated with contract revenues are recognized as incurred 
these contracts can be terminated by the sponsor with or without cause 
datatrak is entitled to payment for all work performed through the date of notice of termination and for recovery of some or all costs incurred to terminate a contract 
the termination of a contract will not result in a material adjustment to revenue or costs previously recognized 
datatrak is also a seller and licenser of software 
generally  revenue is recognized upon delivery of sold software 
licensing revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the license 
to date datatrak has not recognized any revenue from software sales 
since its purchase of the datatrak edc tm software  in january  datatrak has recorded revenue related to two fixed unit price clinical trial contracts 
at december   datatrak s backlog  related to one contract  was  in the future datatrak may also record revenue related to the sales of software 
due to datatrak s early stage of development and its low level of backlog  there can be no assurance as to its future levels of revenue 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed in thousands by line of business 
year ended december  other clinical datatrak corporate business business items total revenue   direct costs   gross profit loss   selling  general and administrative expenses     impairment charge   special items   depreciation and amortization  loss from operations     other income expense   loss before income taxes     income tax expense net loss     year ended december  other clinical datatrak corporate business business items total revenue   direct costs   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses     special items   depreciation and amortization  loss from operations     other income expense   loss before income taxes     income tax expense benefit net loss     year ended december  other clinical datatrak corporate business business items total revenue   direct costs   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses    depreciation and amortization income loss from operations   other income expense   income loss before income taxes    income tax expense net income loss    during  the company s only line of business was the clinical business 
for comparative purposes  statement of operations items related to corporate overhead have been shown in the other corporate items column of the table for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with year ended december  clinical business 
revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of a decline in revenue from clinical trials conducted by the clinical business  caused by the inability to attract sufficient new business and convert existing backlog into revenue during the year ended december  during both and the clinical business performed services on approximately contracts 
the size  duration and difficulty of each contact varies  therefore the amount of backlog converted into revenue and revenue earned in any year is independent of the number of contracts on which services are performed 
during the second half of  the company hired a new vice president of marketing and sales and rebuilt its sales force in an effort to increase backlog 
in december of the company hired a chief operating officer for the clinical business and a new general manager for gfi 
during  million of new contracts was added to backlog  however  due to the duration of many of these contacts  much of this new backlog was not converted into revenue in the clinical business s backlog at december  was million 
the company expects million to be converted to revenue in there can be no assurance as to the level of backlog that will be added in  or as to the clinical business s level of revenue in and beyond 
direct costs include compensation and related fringe benefits for non administrative employees including those at company owned research facilities and other expenses directly related to contracts  which can be subcontracted to the affiliated sites and other vendors

as a percentage of revenue  direct costs increased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the clinical business incurs a high level of fixed direct costs at its owned research sites  due to the number of clinical and support personnel required in order to offer clinical services at these sites 
the increase in direct costs as a percentage of revenue was the result of the division s low level of revenue and its inability to leverage fixed costs at its company owned research facilities 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business development costs  and costs associated with the growth and quality maintenance of the affiliated site network  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
approximately of the clinical business s sg a expenses are for costs associated with the growth and quality maintenance of the affiliated site network 
these affiliated site network costs  which include among other things expenses related to personnel  travel  advertising  database management and regulatory compliance  are expensed as incurred 
sg a costs for the year ended december  decreased  to million as compared to million during the year ended december  of this decrease  was the result of the company s exiting of its european and other strategic initiatives  which were intended to increase the types of research services offered by the clinical business

the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue was the result of the clinical business s low level of revenue being unable to absorb its fixed operating costs 
during  the clinical business recorded asset impairment charges of million related to the impairment of goodwill 
of this charge  million was related to goodwill written off related to two clinical business locations that were closed in september due to poor operating performance 
the million of goodwill represents the unamortized portion of goodwill that was allocated to these sites at the time of their purchase 
the remaining million of the impairment charge was for goodwill associated with gfi s operations 
gfi s revenue was in continual decline and its net losses continued to increase since its acquisition 
in the third quarter of  after management s efforts to effect a turn around were exhausted  and concurrent with the company s planning process  it was determined that the possibility of recovering the recorded value of the gfi goodwill through a sale of gfi  exclusive of a sale of the entire clinical business was remote 
in addition  it was determined that gfi s future undiscounted cash flows were below the carrying value of gfi s long lived assets 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  the company adjusted the carrying value of gfi s long lived assets to their estimated fair value of approximately million  resulting in the non cash charge of million 
the estimated fair value was based on the purchase price allocated to gfi pursuant to an initial offer from west to purchase the clinical business 
the write downs of goodwill will result in a reduction of the clinical business s depreciation and amortization expense by approximately  as compared to expense levels 
the clinical business incurred special items charges of million for the year ended december  of this total   was incurred as part of the company s reorganization plan and included severance costs for employees who were terminated in march of  costs associated with the relocation of certain clinical business employees and costs related to a lawsuit settlement with two former clinical business executive officers

the company s contracts usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received upon completion of negotiated performance milestones throughout the life of the contract 
all amounts received are recorded as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized

the actual proceeds received by the company in the proposed sale will depend on the clinical business s net working capital as of the closing date  and on the collection of net accounts receivable during the days following the closing date 
the company has not yet determined how those proceeds  as well as its other cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be used 
the board is considering numerous alternatives consistent with its objective to permit shareholders to realize the value of the datatrak technology 
among them  the board is considering using some of the proceeds to provide working capital to finance datatrak s development and expansion either independently or in conjunction with one or more strategic partners 
it is also considering using a portion of the proceeds to repurchase outstanding common shares 
the board is also considering a possible sale or merger of the company 
however  the company is not currently engaged in any discussions or negotiations concerning a sale or merger of the company 
subsequent to the proposed sale  it is possible that the company may be required to voluntarily delist its common shares from quotation and trading on nasdaq  which may impair the liquidity of the trading market for the common shares 
however  if the common shares are delisted  the company may list its common shares for trading over the counter or may apply for listing of the common shares on the nasdaq smallcap market  subject to nasdaq s approval 
the company s liquidity and capital resources would not be materially effected if it were required to voluntarily delist its common shares from quotation and trading on nasdaq 
however  a delisting of the common shares could have a long term impact on the company s ability to raise future capital through a sale of its common shares 
in january  datatrak purchased the edc software now known as datatrak edc tm from eds for  the company is responsible for funding the future development and testing of this software

the company expects such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments  cash flow from operations  borrowings under its line of credit  as needed  and the proceeds from the sale of its clinical business 
year readiness disclosure many existing computer systems and software programs currently in use are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the company understands that as the new millennium approaches it is vital to all of its sponsors  affiliated sites and suppliers that collaborative s internal information technology it and non it systems are year compliant 
in addition  just as important a priority is the compliance of external it and non it systems and services provided by others to collaborative 
to meet the above compliance requirements collaborative has utilized the following methodology since mid it has i developed a three year plan with year it issues as a priority  ii established a corporate year program  iii performed a physical inventory of all it and non it systems and software  iv delegated internal year evaluation and testing responsibilities within the company  v assessed its compliance with the above plans on an on going basis  vi identified and categorized any mission critical items  vii repaired or replaced all non compliant it and non it systems and services  viii internally tested all systems and services for compliance  ix compiled appropriate documentation of all testing and vendor compliance statements  x queried its utilities  sponsors  affiliated sites and suppliers as to their readiness and status  xi developed a business contingency plan in the event of year malfunctions  and xii issued a public year disclosure statement on the company s web site 
the company has also established internal policies that have actively informed its employees of the year problem and that assist in procurement of only new equipment that is year compliant 
at this point in the company s year effort  substantially all of the company s internal it and non it hardware and software systems have been tested and either replaced or repaired 
the company expects that all other non compliant it and non it systems will either be year ready or replaced by june  there can be no assurance that additional coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future though management believes the possibility of such discoveries is quite low due to the recent vintage and uniformity of it and non it systems throughout collaborative 
the company is in the process of determining how it may be impacted by any third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant sponsors  suppliers and other third parties to determine the extent  if any  to which the company s interface systems could be impacted by those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company will continue these communications through mid management currently does not anticipate any material adverse impact on its operations as a result of year issues of third parties 
however  at this stage of the review no assurance can be given that the failure by one or more third parties to become year compliant will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
management of the company believes an effective program for resolving year issues in a timely manner is in place 
since it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company s operations could be interrupted 
in addition  disruptions in the economy in general resulting from year issues could also adversely impact the company 
the most significant year issue and worst case scenario of concern to the company has been identified as being a long term electrical power disruption 
the company s contingency plans for large scale year disruptions focuses on two critical high level operational issues i the preservation and availability of critical company data as of december  and ii the use of manual transaction processing until all disruptions are eliminated 
to date  the total cost of the year systems review has been immaterial to the company s financial position and results of operations 
management does not anticipate incurring any additional costs that would be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
as of january  the company has not utilized any outside consultants or technical staff to meet its year goals and has no current plans to do so 
inflation to date  the company believes the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
information about forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k contain certain forward looking statements that are based on management s current beliefs  estimates and assumptions concerning the operations  future results and prospects of collaborative and the clinical pharmaceutical research industry in general 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that management anticipates will occur in the future  including statements related to future revenue  profits  expenses  income and earnings per share or statements expressing general optimism about future results  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
in addition  words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the exchange act 
any number of factors could affect future operations and results 
the company has identified the following important factors  which could cause the company s actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
under no circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by the company 
collaborative undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
limited operating history  lack of profitable operations the company commenced operations in and has a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate its performance 
with the exception of  the company has recognized losses in each year since its inception 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable during future periods 
continuing development of datatrak edc tm  ability to absorb corporate overhead although the datatrak edc tm software has been used in clinical trials  its continued development is necessary 
upon the proposed sale of the clinical business  the company will have a minimal backlog and minimal revenues from which to support the costs of this continued development 
there can be no guarantee of datatrak s potential future revenue  or its ability to absorb its corporate overhead and other fixed operating costs that will be necessary for the success of the datatrak r process 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company is subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including the company s success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which the company participates  the timing of sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials and other factors 
as a result of the company s limited operating history  the company does not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods on which to base planned operating expenses 
therefore  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
there can be no assurance as to the company s revenue in any given period  and it may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of the company s relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accurately anticipate quarterly results 
volatility in the company s quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of the company s common shares 
risks associated with unproven business strategies and early stage of the company s development the company s efforts to establish a standardized edc and qrc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of sponsors 
the long term viability of the company s business remains unproven 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy will continue to gain acceptance among sponsors  research sites or investigators 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts 
potential delay or loss of contracts although the company s contracts with sponsors provide that it is entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  sponsors generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or the company s contract related thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
a sponsor s decision to delay or terminate a trial in which the company participates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on major customers the company s primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company s business is substantially dependent on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
bayer accounted for all of datatrak s revenue  totaling  during each of the three years in the period ended december   sales to companies in the pharmaceutical industry accounted for more than of the company s revenue 
during  sales to merck co  inc and dey laboratories accounted for approximately and of the clinical business s revenue  respectively 
other customers in the pharmaceutical industry have from time to time accounted for more than of the clinical business s annual revenue

these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the company s services

many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company  and there can be no assurance of the company s ability to continue to compete effectively with these larger competitors 
there can be no assurance that these larger competitors will not develop their own networks of affiliated sites  nor as to the effect of such competing networks on the company s operations 
the company may also face competition from other networks of research sites in the recruitment of potential affiliated sites 
the edc market  which is still developing  is also highly fragmented 
the major competitors include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies

potential liability from operations clinical trials involve the testing of approved and experimental drugs on human beings 
this testing carries with it a significant risk of liability for personal injury or death to participants resulting from an adverse reaction to  or improper administration of  the potential product 
the company participates with sponsors in the site selection process 
the company also contracts on behalf of its customers with physicians who render  and itself renders  professional services including administering the drugs being tested to participants in these trials 
consequently  the company may be subject to claims in the event of personal injury or death of persons participating in clinical trials and arising from professional malpractice of physicians with whom it has contracted and its own employees 
although the company is generally indemnified by its clients for such liability  in order for such indemnification to be valid  the company and its employees and agents must act within the bounds of specific procedural requirements governing the conduct of the clinical trial 
since the value of the company s indemnification depends on the financial viability of the indemnifying party  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to rely on such indemnification in each instance of potential liability 
in addition  the company has significant involvement in the patient treatment process at its owned research facilities 
accordingly  the company s risk of liability for malpractice is increased 
if the company was forced to undertake the defense of  or found financially responsible for  claims based upon the foregoing or related risks  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
clinical pharmaceutical and medical device research also requires the review and handling of large amounts of patient data

anti takeover provisions  preferred share purchase rights the company s articles of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may discourage a third party from acquiring  or attempting to acquire the company 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for common shares of the company s stock 
in addition preferred shares of the company s stock can be issued by the company s board of directors  without shareholder approval  whether under the company s shareholder rights plan or for other uses determined by the board 
the issuance of preferred shares may adversely affect the rights of common shareholders  the market price of the common shares and may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding common shares of the company 
at the present time  the company does not plan to issue any preferred shares 
general economic conditions to date the company believes that conditions such as the rate of employment  inflation  interest rates  and the condition of the capital markets have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition
