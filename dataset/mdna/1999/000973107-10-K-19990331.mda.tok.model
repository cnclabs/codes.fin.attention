the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview act manufacturing  inc provides value added electronics manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers oems in the networking and telecommunications  computer  industrial and medical equipment markets 
the company provides oems with complex printed circuit board pcb assembly primarily utilizing advanced surface mount technology smt  mechanical and molded cable and harness assembly  electro mechanical sub assembly  and total system assembly and integration 
the company targets moderate volume production runs of the complex  leading edge commercial market applications of emerging and established oems  which generally require technologically advanced and flexible manufacturing as well as a higher degree of value added services 
these applications are generally characterized by multiple configurations and high pcb densities 
as an integral part of its service to oem customers  the company provides advanced manufacturing and test engineering  flexible materials management  and comprehensive test services  as well as product repair  packaging  order fulfillment and distribution services 
the company was founded in as a contract manufacturer of cable and harness assemblies 
in  the founder of the company organized a separate corporation to serve as a contract manufacturer of pcb assemblies 
each of these companies was acquired by the current principal stockholder of the company effective january  pursuant to two option agreements  one of which was entered into in july and the other of which was entered into in june the predecessor pcb assembly company was merged with and into the company in december  at which time the company changed its name to act manufacturing  inc from november  to march   the company was treated as an s corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes 
as a result  during that period the company had not been subject to federal income taxes and had been subject to certain state income taxes at a reduced rate 
accordingly  net income for periods prior to is presented on a pro forma basis as if the company had been a c corporation for such periods 
the company expanded the geographic scope of its operations through two strategic acquisitions in june the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of electronic systems international  located in norcross  georgia 
electronic systems international provides electronics manufacturing services to oems based primarily in the southeastern united states consisting of pcb assembly  electro mechanical subassembly and total system assembly 
the company also acquired advanced component technologies limited fka signmax limited  located in dublin  ireland 
advanced component technologies limited fka signmax limited provides electronics manufacturing services primarily consisting of cable and harness assembly and production has been expanded to include a pcb operation utilizing smt technology 
the operating results of the acquired businesses are included from the date of purchase in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes a full year of operations of the acquired businesses 
see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company typically recognizes revenue upon shipment to customers 
the company generally does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from its customers  and  accordingly  works with its customers to anticipate delivery dates and future volume of orders based on customer forecasts 
the level and timing of orders placed by the company s oem customers vary due to customer attempts to manage inventory  changes in the oem s manufacturing strategy and variation in demand for customer products due to  among other things  introduction of new products  product life cycles  competitive conditions or industry or general economic conditions 
the company may source components for product assemblies based on customer forecasts 
however  the company s policy is that customers are responsible for materials and associated acquisition costs in the event of a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from the forecasted amounts 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each fiscal year indicated 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest and other expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss for the year ended december   the company experienced significant changes and events that adversely affected its results of operations 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the company experienced a decrease in net sales on both a sequential and comparable period basis 
the decline in net sales was principally due to a softness in demand from several major customers resulting in the conversion of fewer forecasted orders than anticipated as well as  in the case of the third quarter  orders and commitments anticipated to ship prior to the end of the quarter that were received too late for configuration and completion in the quarter 
the company identified a significant inventory shortfall as a result of its year end physical inventory 
as a result of the shortfall  the company recorded a charge of approximately million that was included in cost of goods sold for the shortfall was investigated by company personnel and  under the direction of the audit committee of the board of directors  by independent external accounting specialists 
the ultimate cause of the shortfall could not be finally determined  and accordingly the associated charge was reported in the fourth quarter of as a result of this shortfall  the company has reviewed and continues to review its security procedures and operating and financial controls and  based upon such review  has implemented enhanced security systems and inventory work in process tracking systems and expects to continue to identify opportunities to implement enhanced procedures and controls 
the company expects to continue to conduct quarterly inventories until it can assess the effectiveness of these measures 
in addition  in the company included in its accounts receivable reserve approximately million in connection with amounts due from discontinued customers and accrued an expense of  for professional fees related to the investigation of the inventory shortfall 
the company provides electronics manufacturing services to customers in the networking and telecommunications  computer  industrial and medical equipment markets 
the percentage of net sales by market for the years ended  and is as follows market percentage of net sales networking telecommunications computer industrial medical compared to the company s net sales increased million or to million in from million in the increase was attributed principally to an expansion of business from existing customers and sales to new customers in the pcb assembly markets 
the increase was also due to the effect of a full year of operations of the acquisitions made in as a percentage of net sales  the company s largest customers in included ascend  emc and bay networks as compared to bay networks  emc and ascend in in each of the second  third and fourth quarters of the company experienced increased net sales compared to the respective comparable quarters in net sales in the pcb assembly division including system integration and test operations  as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in net sales in the cable and harness assembly division accounted for of net sales compared to of net sales 
gross profit increased million or to million compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin increased to in from in within gross margin was   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
this sequential improvement is due primarily to higher absorption of manufacturing overhead  the positive impact of the company s cost management programs and a favorable product mix 
in addition  expenses were impacted by a charge relating to the inventory shortfall of approximately million which was included in cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million or to million in  from million in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to is primarily the result of a reduction in sg a in due to cost management programs at the company while net sales increased in operating income increased million to million in  compared with an operating loss of million for as a result of the previously discussed factors 
interest and other expense  net decreased million to million for from million for the decrease in interest and other expenses resulted principally from reduced average borrowings on the company s credit facility 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million in the effective income tax rate was in the company expects that the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  will approximate 
compared to the company s net sales increased million or to million in from million in this increase was attributed principally to an expansion of business from existing customers and sales to new customers in the pcb assembly markets 
the increase was also due to the effect of acquisitions made by the company during without the acquisitions  the increase in net sales would have been approximately 
as a percentage of net sales  the company s largest customers in included bay networks  emc and ascend 
as a percentage of net sales in  ascend was the largest customer with of net sales 
during  the company experienced a reduction in  and then a termination of  business with com 
sales to com were less than of net sales in compared to of company net sales in net sales in the pcb assembly division including system integration and test operations increased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in net sales in the cable and harness assembly division accounted for of net sales compared to of net sales 
gross profit decreased by million or to million in compared to million in gross margin decreased to in from in this change is attributable primarily to the following the million inventory shortfall  changes in product mix with shipments of lower margin products higher than anticipated  lower than anticipated shipments resulting in lower manufacturing absorption  and the incidence of higher than normal manufacturing efficiency variances 
these occurrences primarily affected business operating results in the second half of gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the first and second quarters of was relatively consistent with business operating results 
without the effect of the inventory shortfall charge  gross margin would have decreased to in due to the aforementioned reasons 
sg a expenses increased million or to million in from million in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales for compared to reflects the charges associated with accounts receivable provisions  provision for professional fees related to the investigation of the inventory shortfall  acquisitions made in ireland and norcross  georgia  the continued investment in sales and marketing programs at the company  and the effects of lower third and fourth quarter net sales levels affecting full year comparative results 
without the effect of these provisions for accounts receivable and non recurring professional services  sg a as a percentage of net sales would have been in compared to of net sales in operating income was a loss of million for compared with operating income of million for as a result of the previously discussed factors 
interest and other income  net increased to million for compared with million for the increase in interest and other expense resulted principally from additional borrowings on the company s line of credit to support working capital requirements 
the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of million in compared to a provision for income taxes of million in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  the million increase is primarily due to the classification of the outstanding amount under the credit facility as a long term liability at december  operating activities provided million of cash in compared with the use of million of cash in cash was generated by operations in primarily as a result of the refund of income taxes  the increase in accounts payable balances  and the positive impact of a profitable operation in  offset by the impact of higher trade receivables and inventories at december  cash provided by operations was used primarily for the acquisition of property and equipment in of million compared with million for accounts receivable increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase reflects higher net sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  as well as a shift in the requirements of the company s customers to having a higher proportion of shipments occur nearer to the end of the quarter in than in as of december   the company s accounts receivable days sales outstanding for product shipments measured from date of shipment was approximately days 
inventory increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase reflects higher net sales activity levels anticipated in the first quarter of as compared to net sales activity levels in the first quarter of increases for anticipated higher net sales activity levels were offset slightly by inventory management initiatives such as the implementation of in house stores programs with key distributors  whereby certain distributors of the company maintain inventory stockrooms on the company s premises which provide just in time purchases of certain components upon issuance to the company s manufacturing process 
it is expected that distributor in house stores programs will reduce company owned raw materials requirements during capital expenditures amounted to million in of such capital expenditures  million related to leasehold improvements for facility expansion at the company s hudson  massachusetts printed circuit board facility  and million related to leasehold improvements in the company s new facility in ireland 
the remaining million related primarily to the purchase of various manufacturing equipment  furniture and computer equipment 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in in the fourth quarter of  the company executed a new million senior secured credit facility credit facility to replace the company s million loan and security agreement then outstanding 
this new credit facility provides for borrowings up to an aggregate amount of million  limited to a certain percentage of qualified accounts receivable and qualified inventory  of which million was utilized at december  an additional million was available for use at december  based upon the applicable borrowing base 
interest is payable monthly and the credit facility matures in through november   the company may choose an interest rate of either i to 
above the prime rate as announced by the bank  or ii to above the prevailing eurodollar rate depending upon the average borrowing base availability of the company 
commencing december   the company may choose an interest rate of either i to 
above the prime rate as announced by the bank  or ii to above the prevailing eurodollar rate depending upon the calculated leverage rates of the company 
the credit facility requires the company to maintain certain levels of minimum availability and maximum leverage ratios 
in addition to certain other prohibited actions  the credit facility also limits capital expenditures by the company and prohibits the payment of cash dividends on the company s capital stock 
the company exceeded the limit of capital expenditures for provided in the credit facility 
a waiver with regard to the excess has been received from the banks 
at december  the interest rate on the credit facility was 
the company entered into a million interest rate swap agreement in the fourth quarter of simultaneous with the execution of the credit facility 
the swap agreement provides for payments by the company of a fixed rate of interest of and matures on october  the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was approximately  since the fixed rate of interest of was higher than the floating rate 
the company was in default as of december  with certain financial covenants under its former loan and security agreement 
the company s banks waived compliance with such covenants as of december  due to the nature of the financial covenants under such former agreements  in the company reclassified all its long term bank debt of million at december  to a current liability 
the company has equipment lease lines of approximately million available for purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer hardware and software and furniture 
in may  the company entered into a million operating lease line agreement for the purchase of certain equipment in the dublin  ireland facility 
at december  substantially all of this available lease line had been utilized for outstanding commitments 
the company s need for  cost of and access to funds are dependent in the long term on future operating results as well as conditions external to the company 
the company believes that its current sources of and access to future capital are adequate to support operations for the next twelve months 
because the company s capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  however  there is no assurance that the company will not require additional financing during this period 
there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
year readiness disclosure statements the company and the companies with which it does business utilize computer software programs and operating systems and embedded technology in the conduct of their operations 
many computer software programs and operating systems and much technology in use today are unable to distinguish between the year and the year because they use two digit shorthand to define the applicable year 
this is commonly known as the year problem or issue 
if the company does not properly identify and correct its year issues prior to january   the operations of the company could be materially disrupted  due to  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  receive and record inventory or payments  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  the company s operations could also be significantly disrupted if the companies with which it does business are not year compliant on a timely basis  and such failure adversely affects their ability to do business with the company 
any of these year failures or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
to address these issues the company has undertaken an extensive project to assess and remedy the areas within its business and operations which could be adversely affected by year issues  including its information technology it and non it systems and processes 
the first phase of the project is i to determine the extent of the company s year problem by reviewing all of the company s hardware  software  equipment and embedded technology to determine if any of this software and technology is not year compliant and ii to determine whether companies with which it does significant business will be year compliant on a timely basis 
the next stage in the project is to correct or replace and test all such hardware  software  equipment and embedded technology of the company and to address the year issues identified at the company s vendors and customers  as appropriate 
the project is being conducted by the company using internal and external resources 
finally  the company will determine the need to formulate and revise contingency plans based on the results of its assessment and remediation efforts with regard to its own year issues as well as those of its customers and suppliers 
the company has substantially completed the assessment stage of the project and has commenced the remediation stage 
the company has also begun discussions regarding year compliance with its vendors and customers  and has not been informed by any vendor or customer of material year compliance problems which are likely to cause a material disruption in the company s operations 
the company will continue to work with its vendors and customers to identify any possible issues  including testing interfaces and site audits 
based on its review to date  the company expects the total cost of its year assessment and remediation project to be approximately million  of which approximately million has been expensed to date 
the company s current expectations regarding the total cost of its year project are subject to change as the project progresses and more detailed information is developed regarding the remediation efforts necessary to make the company year compliant on a timely basis 
the sources of the funds for the company s year project are operating cash flow and available equipment lease lines 
no other material company it project has been deferred as a result of the year project 
the company currently does not believe that internal year issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company has identified its significant systems which could be adversely affected by year issues to be i manufacturing equipment including smt lines and testing equipment  ii integrated enterprise resource planning erp systems and networking software and equipment used in its massachusetts  atlanta and ireland facilities  and iii electronic commerce capabilities 
the company has obtained certifications from its equipment vendors indicating that its critical manufacturing and testing equipment is year compliant 
the company plans to test its critical equipment by june  the company has installed a vendor certified year compliant version of erp software in its massachusetts facilities 
the company plans to test such erp software by june  the version of the erp software used by the company s atlanta facility is certified as year compliant by the vendor and was installed and tested by the company in february the erp systems used in the company s ireland facility is not year compliant and cannot be upgraded 
the company has purchased the version of the vendor certified year compliant software utilized in the atlanta facility and has engaged the software vendor to assist in implementing the new erp system in its ireland facility 
the project plan provides for a completion date of june  all network software and electronic commerce capabilities are in the remediation phase with completion of testing and contingency planning scheduled for june  for the above identified applications  the company is developing manual process procedures as a contingency plan 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s plans and programs to become year compliant will succeed in their entirety  or be completed on a timely basis or that the use of the company s internal resources to complete the project will not adversely effect other aspects of the company s business 
the company s ability to implement its year compliance plan and to make the necessary modifications or replacements may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside the control of the company  including the availability and cost of trained personnel and the ability of such personnel to acquire year compliant systems and otherwise to locate and correct all relevant computer codes 
in addition  there can be no assurance that one or more of the company s vendors or customers won t have material year compliance problems 
if either the company or any of its customers or suppliers fail to become year compliant on a timely basis  or if the costs to the company are significantly greater than currently anticipated  the result could be a significant disruption in the company s business due to a failure in the systems designed to allow the company to process transactions  invoice and receive payments  receive inventory from suppliers or engage in similar business practices 
such failure would result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
newly issued accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
management is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on the financial statements of the company 
the company will adopt this accounting standard on january   as required 
cautionary statements the private securities litigation reform act of the act contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information  which involve risk and uncertainties 
any statements in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements including  but not limited to  statements concerning the company s year plans  expectations  compliance and cost  the characteristics and growth of the company s market and customers  the company s expectations  objectives and plans for future operations  the company s ability to effectively manage the costs of the manufacturing processes  and the company s expected results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
the following cautionary statements should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
the factors discussed in these cautionary statements  among other factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
these cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
customer and market concentration  dependence on electronics industry for  the company s five largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
three customers accounted for in excess of of net sales individually in sales to ascend  emc and bay networks were approximately   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for in  the company s five largest customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales 
sales to bay networks  ascend and emc were approximately   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the company s results will depend to a significant extent on the success achieved by its oem customers in marketing their products and the company s ability to diversify its customer base in order to reduce its reliance on particular customers 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products and services from the company at current levels  if at all  or that the company will be able to consistently expand its customer base to make up any sales shortfalls from such major customers and increase overall revenue 
the loss of one or more major customers  a significant reduction in purchases from such customers  discontinuance by any major customer of products manufactured by the company  the failure to expand its customer base or developments adverse to the company s customers or their products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company could be adversely affected if a major customer were unable or unwilling to pay for products and services on a timely basis or at all 
the company s customer base has historically been concentrated in a limited number of segments within the electronics industry 
net sales to customers within the networking and telecommunications segment accounted for over of the company s net sales in each of  and these industry segments  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to intense competition  consolidation  rapid technological changes  significant fluctuations in product demand  relatively short product life cycles  and consequent product obsolescence 
developments adverse to such industry segments could have a material negative effect on the company 
the industry segments served by the company are also subject to economic cycles and have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
in addition  the company cannot predict whether year concerns will adversely affect demands or spending patterns for its customers products  thereby adversely affecting demand for the company s services 
a recessionary period or other event leading to excess capacity or downturn affecting the electronics industry generally or one or more of the industry segments served by the company would likely result in intensified price competition  reduced gross margins and a decrease in net sales  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
variability of customer requirements  nature and extent of customer commitments on orders the level and timing of orders placed by the company s oem customers vary due to customer attempts to manage inventory  changes in the oem s manufacturing strategy and variation in demand for customer products due to  among other things  introduction of new products  product life cycles  competitive conditions or industry or general economic conditions 
the company generally does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from its customers and  accordingly  works with its customers to anticipate delivery dates and future volume of orders based on customer forecasts 
the company relies on its estimates of anticipated future volumes when making commitments regarding the levels of business that it will seek and accept  the timing of production schedules  the purchase of inventory and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
from time to time  the company will purchase certain components without a customer commitment to pay for them 
the company may source components for product assemblies based on customer forecasts 
however  the company s policy is that customers are responsible for materials and associated acquisition costs in the event of a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from the forecasted amounts 
in the event a customer is unwilling or unable or not obligated to reimburse the company for materials costs in the case of a significant variance from forecast  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  may cause customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
the variability of the level and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers may result in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
a substantial portion of net sales in a given quarter may depend on obtaining and fulfilling orders for assemblies to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which those orders are received 
further  a significant portion of net sales in a given quarter may depend on assemblies configured  completed  packaged and shipped in the final weeks of such quarter 
in addition to the variability resulting from the short term nature of its customers commitments  other factors have contributed  and may in the future contribute  to such fluctuations 
these factors include  among other things  customers announcements and introductions of new products or new generations of products  evolutions in the life cycles of customers products  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  cost effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes  changes in costs and availability of labor and components  efficiencies achieved by the company in managing inventory and fixed assets  a shift in the company s product assembly mix which results in fluctuating margins  capacity utilization  inventory obsolescence  currency exchange rate movements  acquisitions and related charges and expenses  competition in the electronics manufacturing services market  trends in the electronics industry and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
an interruption in manufacturing resulting from shortages of parts or equipment  fire  earthquake or other natural disaster  equipment failure or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed  any unanticipated shortfall in revenue in a quarter may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for that quarter 
management s failure to cost effectively manage its manufacturing processes and manage inventory levels also could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  it is possible that in some future period the company s results of operations will fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and the price of the common stock would then be materially and adversely affected 
competition the electronics manufacturing services industry is highly competitive 
the company competes against numerous us and foreign electronics manufacturing services providers with global operations 
the company also faces competition from a number of electronics manufacturing services providers who operate on a local or regional basis 
in addition  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  systems  sales and marketing resources than the company 
also  due to the consolidation trend within the industry  the company faces larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have combined resources with which to compete against the company 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  may adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and may devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their services than the company 
the company may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers or who have lower cost structures 
the company s manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection  and companies with significant resources or international operations may enter the market 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the segments of the electronics manufacturing services industry in which it operates are technology  service  manufacturing capability  quality  geographic location  price  reliability  timeliness in delivering finished products and flexibility in adapting to customers needs 
there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
management of growth the company has grown rapidly in recent years and expects to continue to expand its operations 
such growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant strain on the company s management  operations  technical  financial  systems  marketing and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth will require it to continue to invest in its operational  financial and management information systems  as well as to develop further the management skills of its managers and supervisors and to retain  motivate and effectively manage its employees 
in addition  as a result of the inventory shortfall occurring in the fourth quarter of  the company has reviewed and continues to review its security procedures and operating and financial controls and  based upon such review  has implemented enhanced security systems and inventory work in process tracking systems and expects to continue to identify opportunities to implement enhanced procedures and controls 
there can be no assurance  however  that the controls implemented by management will result in the cost savings anticipated by management 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the quality of the company s services and products  its ability to retain key personnel and its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition for personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified employees in the future  especially senior managers  engineering and sales personnel 
the failure to hire and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statements acquisitions and geographic expansion and dependence upon key personnel and skilled employees 
acquisitions and geographic expansion in june  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of electronic systems international  located in norcross  georgia 
the acquired company provides electronics manufacturing services  primarily consisting of pcb assembly  electro mechanical subassembly and total systems assembly to customers based primarily in the southeastern united states 
also in june  the company completed the acquisition of advanced component technologies limited fka signmax limited located in dublin  ireland 
advanced component technologies limited fka signmax limited provides electronics manufacturing services primarily consisting of cable and harness assembly 
the company has limited experience in managing geographically dispersed operations  in integrating acquired companies into its operations  in expanding the scope of operations of acquired businesses  and in operating in the southeastern united states or internationally 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will operate the acquired businesses profitably in the future 
the company may expand into other geographical areas within the united states and internationally by acquiring additional electronics manufacturing services providers or by establishing new manufacturing operations in such areas 
the company may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with entities having significantly greater resources than the company 
any such transactions may result in the potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  and other costs and expenses  all of which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations following such a transaction 
such transactions also involve numerous business risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees from the combined company 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the key employees and businesses of acquired companies will be successfully integrated with the company  that any acquired business will contribute significantly to the company s sales or earnings  or that sales and earnings of the company will not be adversely effected by the integration process or other factors 
dependence upon key personnel and skilled employees the company s future success will be largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of john a 
pino  its president and chief executive officer  and other key executives as well as its managerial  sales and technical employees 
none of the senior management or other key employees of the company is subject to any employment contract or noncompetition agreement and the company does not maintain any key man life insurance on any of its key executives 
the loss of services of any of its executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  continued growth of the company will require that  despite significant competition  it attract  motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced managerial  sales and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company s business and operations 
expansion of facilities and manufacturing capacity the company believes its long term competitive position depends in part on its ability to increase manufacturing capacity 
the company may obtain such additional capacity through acquisitions or through expansion of its current facilities 
the acquisition and expansion of additional facilities from time to time will require substantial additional capital  and there can be no assurance that such capital will be available 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire sufficient capacity or successfully integrate and manage such additional facilities 
in addition  the company s expansion of its manufacturing capacity has significantly increased its fixed costs  and the future profitability of the company will depend on its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 
the failure to obtain sufficient capacity or to successfully integrate and manage additional manufacturing facilities could adversely impact the company s relationships with its customers  limit the company s growth opportunities and materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item properties 
availability of key components the company and many of its customers rely on a single or limited number of third party suppliers for many components used in the assembly process 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements
