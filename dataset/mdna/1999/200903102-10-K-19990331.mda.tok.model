item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an information technology service company providing a wide range of computer consulting services to our customers 
historically  we have derived the majority of our revenue from our traditional staff augmentation services and software and hardware solutions 
we introduced year compliance services in december as a result of the significant demand for such services  a significant percentage of our revenue during the year ended december  and was derived from year compliance services 
year compliance services  as well as other complete project and solution services  typically provide higher margins than our staff augmentation and software and hardware solutions 
moreover  as indicated below  we have decided to de emphasize our hardware solutions services 
the following table sets forth the revenue percentages by line of business

 staff augmentation year software and hardware other total revenue as indicated above  revenue from year projects decreased as a percentage of our revenue in each of the quarters in there can be no assurance that revenue from year projects will not decrease as a percentage of our revenue for future periods 
we have decided to de emphasize our hardware solutions services due to the fact that they carry low margins and  therefore  hardware solutions may constitute a decreasing percentage of our revenue 
the results of operations during were adversely affected primarily due to costs associated with our increase in sales and project management personnel  which were not accompanied by expected growth in complete projects and solutions business 
in addition  we experienced a lower than expected gross margin reflecting low rates of employee utilization in the offshore technology resource center  a less profitable mix of business and reduced margins from year and other project business 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue may be affected as we continue to strive to shift an increasing percentage of our business from staff augmentation to a project orientation 
following certain concerns expressed relating to our performance under a year compliance services contract for one of our largest customers in early  the customer terminated the contract 
as a result of diminishing demand for year services and the impact of the recent decision by one of our significant customers to discontinue using outside staff augmentation services  we expect to experience a decline in our revenue in the first quarter of in addition  one of our large year contracts was completed as scheduled during the fourth quarter of due to such decline in revenue and our relatively fixed costs  as well as continued pressure on our gross margins  our business will be materially and adversely affected unless and until we increase revenue from other sources or lower our costs 
over of our service revenue is billed on a time and materials basis 
revenue from services provided on a time and materials basis is recognized in the period that services are provided 
the balance of our service revenue is derived from services provided on a fixed price basis 
such revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
we bear the risk of cost overruns and inflation with respect to our fixed price projects 
when entering into such contracts  we strive to mitigate the attendant risks by subdividing such projects into smaller  more manageable phases with fixed price and time frames 
see item business risk factors our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected because of our project intensive business and certain relatively fixed costs 
in the mid s  several conferences and market pronouncements increased worldwide awareness of the year problem  which prevents existing applications from properly interpreting dates after we began providing year compliance services in december through our workforce both in the us and at the software development facility in bangalore  india in response to the needs and demands of our customers 
see item business risk factors rapidly diminishing for year services  we depend on our bangalore  india facility and doing business in india is risky and item business industry overview 
personnel and rent expenses represent a significant percentage of our operating expenses and are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
in particular  due to hiring and employment practices and applicable law in india  it has been difficult to affect appropriate reductions of staff at our bangalore  india facility in response to revenue shortfalls 
senior management seeks to manage our personnel utilization rates by carefully monitoring our needs and basing most personnel increases on specific project requirements 
to the extent revenue does not increase at a rate commensurate with these additional expenses  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
during  we entered into an agreement with phoenix home life mutual insurance company to organize command international software pvt 
in bangalore  india  an offshore technology resource center 
initially  we and phoenix maintained a and interest  respectively  in command international software pvt 
on december   phoenix  acting through a wholly owned subsidiary  exchanged its interest for shares of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
phoenix converted these shares of preferred stock into  shares of common stock upon consummation of the initial public offering 
accordingly  we currently own of the bangalore facility 
as a result of the acquisition of the minority interest in the bangalore facility  we recorded goodwill of approximately million which will be amortized over a period of years commencing january  we believe that as a result of the detonation of nuclear devices in india in may  there may be some adverse economic repercussions caused by the institution of sanctions or other similar actions  the effects of which are unknown to management at this time 
although the us government has decided to lift some sanctions  other sanctions remain 
no assurance can be given that such actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
income tax matters from our inception through august   we had elected to be taxed under the s corporation provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
an s corporation generally is not subject to income tax at the corporate level  with certain exceptions under state income tax laws 
this election was terminated in conjunction with our formation as a delaware holding corporation and the issuance of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in connection with the termination of our s corporation status  we were required by the internal revenue code to change our method of accounting for tax reporting purposes from the cash method to the accrual method 
this change resulted in a one time charge to earnings of  which was recorded in the three month period ended september  this was the result of differences of approximately million in the tax treatment of some of our assets and liabilities under the cash and accrual methods of accounting and is reflected through an increase in current and deferred income tax liabilities 
the offshore technology resource center in bangalore  india is eligible for certain favorable tax treatment provided under india law including 
an exemption from payment of corporate income taxes for a period of five consecutive years in the first eight years of operation or  
an exemption from income taxes on the profits derived from sources outside india  known as an export exemption 
the export exemption remains available after expiration of the tax holiday 
as a result of the availability of these exemptions  we have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to the undistributed earnings of the offshore technology resource center  which aggregated approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
we consider these earnings to be permanently invested in india and do not anticipate repatriating any of these earnings to the us if any earnings of our subsidiary  command international software pvt  are repatriated to the us in the future  we will be required to record a provision for income taxes on such amounts and  upon repatriation of the funds  pay us taxes thereon 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expense litigation expense loss income from operations other income expense  net loss income before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit provision loss before minority interest minority interest net loss preferred stock dividends and accretion loss applicable to common stockholders year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue

as compared to the year ended december   revenue from year projects and other services for the year ended december  increased as a percentage of our revenue 
however  revenue from year projects and other services for the three months ended december  decreased as a percentage of our revenue as compared to the three month periods ended march  and june   and was slightly higher than the three months ended september  there can be no assurance that revenue from year and other services will not continue to decrease as a percentage of our revenue for future periods 
we have decided to de emphasize our hardware solutions services due to the fact that they carry low margins and  therefore  hardware solutions may constitute a decreasing percentage of our revenue 
as a result of diminishing demand for year services and the impact of the recent decision of one of our significant customers to discontinue using outside staff augmentation services  we expect to experience a decline in our revenue in the first quarter of in addition  we completed one of our large year contracts during the fourth quarter gross profit 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits for personnel as well as the cost of hardware and software purchased for resale to customers 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from low rates of employee utilization in india  a less profitable mix of business and reduced margins for year  other project and staff augmentation business 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits for selling and administrative personnel as well as travel  telecommunications and occupancy costs for our us and india operations 
these expenses are relatively fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
to the extent revenue does not increase at a rate commensurate with these expenses  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
selling  general and administrative expense  net of amortization of goodwill  for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december   and included a one time charge to operations of  relating to the proposed settlement of stockholder litigation and related costs 
in addition  the increase was also attributable to additional sales and project management personnel  which were added in anticipation of growth in complete projects and solutions business which  did not materialize to the extent expected 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  was  relating to our purchase of the minority interest in our bangalore facility from phl global holding co 
on december  we accounted for this transaction as a purchase and recognized the  excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill that will be amortized over fifteen years 
loss income from operations 
operations for the year ended december  lost  compared to income of  for the year ended december  loss from operations as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  as compared to income of for the year ended december  absent the recognition of the one time settlement and litigation expenses  we would have reported at  loss from operation for the year ended december  other income expense  net 
other income  net  was  for the year ended december  compared to other expense net of  for the year ended december  the other income was primarily attributable to interest earned from investments in commercial paper  cash equivalent instruments and marketable securities from the net proceeds of our initial public offering during the year ended december  interest expense in was a result of bank borrowings required to provide us with working capital and accrued interest expense associated with subordinated notes issued to phoenix home life mutual insurance company 
in addition  during  we recognized an  foreign currency exchange gain in connection with our us dollar denominated cash and receivable balances of the offshore technology resource center in bangalore  india 
income tax provision benefit 
the income tax benefit for the year ended december  was  as a result of the utilization of deferred tax credits 
we compute our income tax provision on a quarterly basis and provide for deferred income taxes based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided when necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized 
from our inception through august   we had elected to be taxed under the s corporation provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
an s corporation generally is not subject to income tax at the corporate level with certain exceptions under state income tax laws 
this election was terminated in conjunction with our formation as a delaware holding corporation and the issuance of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in connection with the termination of our s corporation status  we were required by the internal revenue code to change our method of accounting for tax reporting purposes from the cash method to the accrual method 
this change resulted in a one time charge to earnings in the year ended december  of  resulting from differences of approximately million in the tax treatment of certain of our assets and liabilities under the cash and accrual methods of accounting and is reflected through an increase in current and deferred income tax liabilities 
preferred stock dividends and accretions

as a result of the foregoing  loss applicable to common stockholders was  for the year ended december  as compared to net income of  on a pro forma basis for the year ended december  therefore  basic and diluted loss per share were for the year ended december  as compared to pro forma earnings of for the year ended december  pro forma earnings give rise to the effect of the change in corporate tax status 
absent the recognition of the one time settlement and litigation expense  the net loss for the year ended december  would have been  or per share 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share increased over the comparable period as a result of shares issued in conjunction with our march  initial public offering 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue during the year ended december  increased by to  from  during the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our traditional information technology consulting services and the introduction of year solutions services in december gross profit 
gross profit during the year ended december  increased by to  from  during the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from the introduction of our year solution services which were performed primarily from our offshore technology resource center in bangalore  india and which carried higher margins than our information technology services performed in the united states

these fluctuations in our operating results occur to a large degree because we obtain a large portion of our revenue from large projects and because certain of our costs are relatively fixed 
factors causing these variations include 
number  timing and scope of our projects  
contractual terms of our projects  
delays incurred in performing our projects  
difficulty in accurately estimating resources and time frames for completing our projects  
patterns of capital spending by customers  
information technology outsourcing trends  
pricing changes in response to various competitive factors  
new service introductions by our competitors  
level of market acceptance of our service and product offerings  
our ability to staff our assignments with qualified personnel and 
general economic conditions 
a high percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses  particularly salary  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  unanticipated variations in the number and timing of our projects during a particular quarter may cause a significant variations in the operating results in that quarter 
the following situations could require us to continue to pay for underutilized personnel and  therefore  materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a major project may be terminated unexpectedly 

a customer may decide not to pursue a new project or proceed to a succeeding stage of a current project 

we may complete several major customer projects during a previous quarter 
specifically  hiring and employment practices and applicable law in india make it difficult for us to effect reductions in staffing at our bangalore  india facility 
the results of operations in the second  third and fourth quarter were adversely affected primarily due to costs associated with our increase in a sales and project management personnel which were not accompanied by expected growth in complete projects and solution business 
in addition  we experienced 
a lower than expected gross margin reflecting lower rates of employee utilization in the bangalore  india facility  
a less profitable mix of business and 
reduced margins from year and other project business 
demand for our services generally is lower during the fourth quarter due to reduced activities during the holiday season and fewer working days for those customers which  curtail operations during such period 
we expect such seasonal variations to continue 
see item business risk factors our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected because of our project intensive business and relatively fixed costs 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with 
internally generated cash flows  
borrowings under our line of credit facilities  
proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes to the phoenix home life mutual insurance company and 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering 
our operating activities used  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year december  the use of cash was primarily due to the operating loss we recorded 
we used cash of  for capital expenditures during the year ended december  primarily to support planned sales growth in the farmington facility 
we spent  during the year ended december   which was primarily related to the offshore technology resource center 
our financing activities provided  for the year ended december  and  for the same period in in march  we issued and sold  shares of par value common stock for per share in our initial public offering 
of the  shares we sold  shares were not registered 
in addition   shares sold by selling stockholders in the public offering in march were not covered by a registration statement 
we filed a registration statement covering the  unregistered shares 
this registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on february  persons who purchased unregistered shares in our initial public offering have rescission rights under the securities act of if the purchaser has not sold the shares  the right to rescind means he or she can sue to exchange the unregistered shares for an amount equal to what he or she paid for the shares  plus interest 
if the purchaser no longer owns the unregistered shares  and sold them at a loss  he or she may sue for damages 
the maximum rescission liability for the  unregistered shares which we sold would be   shares at per share plus interest 
we have not recognized a liability based on the rescission of the  unregistered shares since  as noted above  only someone who is still holding the same share he or she bought in the initial public offering has a right of rescission 
since the large trading volume subsequent to our initial public offering suggests a substantial turnover in share ownership and for each individual purchaser  we are unable to identify which shares were registered and which were not  we believe it is not probable that we will be required to effect an actual rescission  instead of paying rescissionary damages we and certain stockholders who sold shares in the initial public offering have entered into an indemnification agreement with our former counsel in the initial public offering  which would hold command and those stockholders harmless for damages which might result from any claims as a consequence of the aforementioned circumstances 
in view of the indemnification agreement  and in light of assurances we have received concerning the professional indemnity insurance maintained by such counsel  we do not believe that any claims relating to the foregoing will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are also being sued by stockholders in connection with the initial public offering 
the stockholders suing us in their consolidated lawsuit seek rescission of the sales of all the shares in the initial public offering and unspecified damages  including rescissionary damages  interest  costs and fees 
if the lawsuit is concluded in favor of the stockholders suing us  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
we and the other defendants have entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the dispute with the stockholders suing us  but a memorandum of understanding is not a definitive settlement agreement 
a definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum will also require court approval 
we cannot be certain that a definitive settlement agreement will be reached  or that  if it is reached  that the court will approve it 
see item legal proceedings 
from the sale of the  shares in the initial public offering  the company received net proceeds of  after underwriters discounts and before other offering expenses in the amount of  simultaneously with the initial public offering  all the holders of series a and b redeemable convertible preferred stock exchanged their shares for  shares of common stock 
dividends accrued during the period and previously unamortized offering expenses have been recognized as a reduction to net income 
we paid preferred stock dividends of  from the proceeds 
for the year ended december   cash was generated under our bank credit facilities  and the issuance of subordinated notes to the phoenix home life mutual insurance company 
as of december   we had  in cash and cash equalivants and  of working capital 
in october  we entered into a new revolving line of credit which limits borrowings to million  for our us operations 
as of december  no amounts were outstanding under such credit facility 
borrowings under this bank line of credit are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and are utilized primarily to fund our working capital requirements 
we are required to maintain a minimum of the following total net worth of five times credit facility  debt service coverage ratio of  interest coverage of  and a current ratio of in june  command international software pvt  our wholly owned indian subsidiary  entered into a funded and non funded credit facility 
the funded facility provides for borrowings up to of our export receivables subject to a maximum of rs 
mm approximately  based upon monthly export credit billing and an overdraft facility of rs 
mm approximately 
the export billing facility is at a base fedai rate of  the overdraft facility is at an interest rate of 
the non funded facility provides for a letter of credit line in the amount of rs 

mm and a guarantee letter of credit line in the amount of rs 

mm approximately 
corresponding deposits equal to are required for utilized facilities 
the letter of credit facility is per annum  the guarantee letter of credit facility charge is at a commission rate of 
these credit facilities are secured primarily by accounts receivable and a lien on the fixed assets of the command international software pvt 
as of december  there was no outstanding amounts under these facilities 
in the past  we have been in default of our covenants and have had to obtain waivers 
while we do not anticipate utilizing this credit facility in the near future  if we do borrow under the line  we may be required to seek additional amendments or waivers 
although we anticipate that we would be able to obtain such amendments or waivers  there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so 
we believe that the net proceeds from the initial public offering  together with other available funds  and the cash flow expected to be generated from operations  will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations over the next months 
legal proceedings see item legal proceedings 
inflation our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our consultants and other professionals 
competition in india and the us for information technology professionals with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform our service offerings have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation 
as with other information technology service providers  we must adequately anticipate wage increases 
further  india has in the past experienced significant inflation 
historically  our wage costs in india have been significantly lower than our wage costs in the us for comparably skilled employees  although wage costs in india are presently increasing at a faster rate than in the us we may not be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the us impact of the year issue the year issue refers to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips or software that use dates where the date has been stored as just two digits eg  for 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism incorporating date sensitive software which uses only two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
we have completed an assessment of our information systems to determine the extent to which our existing systems correctly define the year those systems found not to be compliant have been upgraded by the vendors of those systems except for certain purchased software packages which are expected to be upgraded and brought into compliance by their vendors before the year the majority of the upgrades were implemented via standard maintenance contracts  without costs 
as of this date  a nominal amount has been expended 
the remaining upgrades are expected to be implemented for minimal cost 
based on such review we do not currently believe that we have material exposure to the year problem with respect to our own information systems 
with respect to be information systems of third parties who are our major vendors  we will be seeking to obtain year compliance certifications for those systems that relate to our business 
these third parties may include major hardware and software vendors  as well as financial services providers 
most of our major vendors have made public statements indicating that they intend to cause their products and services to be year compliant on a timely basis 
based on the foregoing  we have not to date developed contingency plans for the failure by our major vendors to provide year compliant products and services 
the year problem could affect the information systems of our major vendors as they relate to our business 
although we believe that the information systems of our major vendors as they relate to our business are year compliant  we cannot be sure that the advent of the year will not affect our major vendors information systems 
if a major vendor s information system fails or malfunctions significantly due to the year problem it could materially and adversely affect us 
recent accounting pronouncements in  we adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances  excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
the primary difference between our net income and our comprehensive income is due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
we are showing comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of comprehensive loss 
in  we adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise  and replaces the industry segment approach with the management approach 
the management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of a company s reportable segments 
sfas no 
also requires disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect results of our operations or financial position or the segments we reported in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk approximately  of our sales consists of work performed by employees at our bangalore  india facility 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets where we employ our workforce 
our currency exposure is concentrated in the indian rupee 
we do not hedge overseas sales demoniated in foreign currencies or translation exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
see item risk factors we do business in international markets which exposes us to currency fluctuations and other problems administering foreign operations 
we utilize bank loans and other debt instruments throughout our operations 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  such debt is usually denominated in the underlying local currency 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  charges in these interest rates primarily affect the interest we earn on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
