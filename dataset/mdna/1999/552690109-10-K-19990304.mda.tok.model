overview the following table dollars in millions  where applicable summarizes the contribution to consolidated earnings by each of the company s businesses 
years ended december  electric natural gas distribution natural gas transmission construction materials and mining oil and natural gas production earnings on common stock earnings per common share basic 
earnings per common share diluted 
return on average common equity reflects the company s three for two common stock split effected in july compared to consolidated earnings for decreased million from the comparable period a year ago due to lower earnings at the oil and natural gas production business  largely resulting from million in noncash after tax write downs of oil and natural gas properties 
decreased earnings at the natural gas distribution business also added to the earnings decline 
higher earnings at the construction materials and mining  natural gas transmission and electric businesses partially offset the earnings decrease 
compared to consolidated earnings for increased million when compared to this increase includes the effect of the one time adjustment in the third quarter of of million or cents per common share  reflecting the write down to market value of natural gas being held under a repurchase commitment and certain reserve adjustments 
the improvement is attributable to increased earnings from the natural gas transmission  electric  and oil and natural gas production businesses  partially offset by a decrease in construction materials and mining  and natural gas distribution earnings

the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for natural gas operating revenues and purchased natural gas sold were million for the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for natural gas operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expenses were million  million and million  respectively  for  and million  million and million  respectively  for compared to electric operations electric earnings increased due to earnings at the utility services companies acquired since mid and increased electric utility earnings 
sales for resale revenue improved due to percent higher volumes and percent higher margins  both due to favorable market conditions 
also contributing to the earnings increase was the absence in of million in maintenance expenses incurred in associated with a ten week maintenance outage at the coyote station 
slightly higher retail sales and decreased net interest expense also contributed to the earnings improvement 
increased fuel and purchased power costs  largely higher purchased power demand charges resulting from the pass through of periodic maintenance costs  and increased operations expense due to higher payroll and benefit related costs  partially offset the electric utility earnings improvement 
depreciation expense increased due to higher average depreciable plant  also partially offsetting the increase in earnings 
utility services contributed million to earnings in natural gas distribution operations earnings decreased at the natural gas distribution business due to reduced weather related sales  the result of percent warmer weather 
increased average realized rates and decreased net interest costs somewhat offset the earnings decline 
natural gas transmission operations earnings at the natural gas transmission business increased due to increases in transportation revenues resulting from a million million after tax reversal of reserves for certain contingencies in the first quarter of relating to a ferc order concerning a compliance filing 
higher volumes transported at higher average transportation rates also contributed to the revenue increase 
increased average prices and production from company owned natural gas reserves added to the earnings improvement 
gains realized on the sale of natural gas held under the repurchase commitment and lower net interest costs also added to the increase in earnings 
the increase in energy marketing revenue and the related increase in purchased gas sold resulted from the acquisition of a natural gas marketing business in july construction materials and mining operations construction materials and mining earnings increased primarily due to businesses acquired since mid and increased earnings at existing construction materials operations 
increased aggregate and asphalt sales volumes due to increased construction activity  and lower cement and asphalt costs contributed to the increase at the existing operations 
earnings at the coal operations increased largely due to increased revenues resulting from higher sales  primarily due to a ten week maintenance outage at the coyote station 
higher interest expense resulting mainly from increased acquisition related long term debt partially offset the increase in earnings 
oil and natural gas production operations earnings for the oil and natural gas production business decreased largely as a result of million million after tax in noncash write downs of oil and natural gas properties  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
lower oil and natural gas revenues also added to the decrease in earnings 
the decrease in revenues was due to realized oil and natural gas prices which were percent and percent lower than last year  respectively  and slightly lower production 
decreased depreciation  depletion and amortization due to lower rates resulting from the aforementioned write downs and lower production partially offset the decrease in earnings 
decreased operation and maintenance expenses  the result of lower production and decreased well maintenance  and decreased production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices  also partially offset the earnings decline 
compared to electric operations higher wholesale electric sales margins  increased average realized retail rates and revenues from the july acquisition of two utility services companies improved operating revenues 
however  decreased retail sales due to warmer fourth quarter weather somewhat offset the improvement 
operating expenses increased due to the above mentioned acquisitions  costs associated with a planned  but extended  maintenance outage at the coyote station and repairs from an april blizzard 
lower payroll and benefit related expenses somewhat offset the operating expense increase 
higher revenues more than offset the operating expense increase leading to improved operating income 
earnings increased due to the operating income increase partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average short term debt balances 
utility services contributed million to earnings 
natural gas distribution operations revenues from the positive effects of a rate change implemented in montana in may and reduced operations expense from lower payroll and benefit related costs did not fully offset reduced natural gas sales caused by percent warmer weather than the pass through of higher average gas costs more than offset the revenue decline resulting from the reduced sales 
increased transportation volumes  primarily to large industrial customers  were offset by lower average transportation rates 
these factors reduced operating income and earnings 
lower net interest expense and increased returns on gas storage and prepaid demand balances partially offset the earnings decline 
natural gas transmission operations increased transportation volumes  higher production from company owned wells  and increased natural gas prices and sales volumes from the energy marketing operations  improved revenues 
the reversal of certain reserves for regulatory contingencies in of million after tax and lower average transportation rates partially offset the revenue improvement 
higher royalty expenses and increased taxes other than income added to the operating income decrease 
earnings improved million compared to  due to the absence of the million after tax write down to the then current market price of the natural gas available under the repurchase commitment and lower costs in associated with this natural gas 
the reversal of certain income tax reserves aggregating million partially offset the earnings improvement 
construction materials and mining operations construction materials revenues improved primarily due to the acquisition of several construction materials businesses in mid and in  combined with improved aggregate and ready mixed concrete sales volumes  increased construction revenues and higher asphalt prices 
however  lower coal sales due to planned but extended maintenance at the coyote station partially offset the revenue improvement 
operating costs associated with the acquisitions  higher construction materials volumes and higher stripping costs at the coal operations reduced operating income 
these factors  combined with higher interest expense resulting mainly from increased acquisition related long term debt  decreased earnings from this business unit 
oil and natural gas production operations slightly higher operating revenues due to higher natural gas prices  largely offset by lower natural gas production and slightly lower oil production and decreased oil prices  added to the operating income improvement 
total operating expenses remained unchanged as lower volume related expenses were largely offset by increased taxes other than income 
overall  earnings increased from slightly higher operating income and decreased net interest expense from lower average long term debt balances

year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
in  the company established a task force with coordinators in each of its major operating units to address the year issue 
the scope of the year readiness effort includes information technology it and non it systems  including computer hardware  software  networking  communications  embedded and micro processor controlled systems  building controls and office equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk fidelity oil has entered into certain price collar agreements to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
the collar agreements call for fidelity oil to receive monthly payments from counterparties when the settlement price is below the floor price in the collar agreement or make monthly payments to counterparties when the settlement price is above the ceiling price in the collar agreement 
these payments are based upon the difference between a fixed and a variable price as specified by the agreements 
the variable price is a quoted natural gas price on the new york mercantile exchange 
the following table presents natural gas collar information for outstanding agreements as of december  the fair value of these collar agreements reflects the estimated amounts that the company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account the current favorable or unfavorable position on open contracts 
favorable and unfavorable positions related to these collar agreements are expected to be generally offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the value of the underlying commodity transactions
