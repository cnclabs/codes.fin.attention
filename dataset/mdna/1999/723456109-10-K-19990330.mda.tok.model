year the company is actively evaluating and resolving any potential impact of the year problem on the processing of date sensitive information by its information systems  and the information systems of vendors upon whom the company is dependent 
the year problem exists because computer systems and applications were historically designed to use two digit fields rather than four to designate a year  and date sensitive systems may not properly recognize  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
hollywood park has established a year project team composed of individuals from each business unit and each corporate function to identify and mitigate year issues  with respect to the company s information systems  products  facilities  suppliers and customers 
internal computer systems the company believes that its various financial reporting software and associated hardware are year compatible 
the company has identified the following software and hardware applications that will need to be upgraded or replaced at an estimated cost of  a point of sale cash register systems  b personal computer networks  and c gaming patron player tracking systems 
this cost estimate is based on numerous assumptions  including the assumptions that the company has already identified the most significant year issues 
there can be no guarantee that these assumptions are accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
external computer systems both the hollywood park and the turf paradise race tracks lease pari mutuel wagering software and associated hardware  though from different providers  which are essential to operations 
each pari mutuel wagering service provider has assured the company  in writing  that they will be year compatible by the end of march the company does not have an alternative software system to handle pari mutuel wagering  and if the pari mutuel wagering service providers are unable to overcome any potential year issues  this would have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company cannot be assured that its year program will be effective  or that estimates about timing and costs of completing the year program will be accurate  or that third party suppliers will timely resolve any or all year problems with their systems 
any failure of a third party supplier to timely resolve their year issues could result in material disruption of the company s business 
such disruption could have a materially adverse effect on hollywood park s business  financial condition and results of operations
