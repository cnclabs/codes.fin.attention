item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statement of operations the company accounts for its operations under generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of its financial performance is captioned net decrease increase in net assets resulting from operations  which is the sum of three elements 
the first element is net operating loss  which is the difference between the company s income from interest  dividends  fees and other income and its operating expenses  net of applicable income tax benefit provision 
the second element is net realized loss on investments  which is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio securities and their stated cost  net of applicable income tax benefits provisions 
these two elements are combined in the company s financial statements and reported as net realized loss 
the third element  net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments  is the net change in the fair value of the company s investment portfolio  net of increase decrease in deferred income taxes that would become payable if the unrealized appreciation were realized through the sale or other disposition of the investment portfolio 
net realized loss on investments and net increase in unrealized appreciation on investments are directly related 
when a security is sold to realize a loss gain  net unrealized appreciation increases decreases and net realized gain decreases increases 
financial condition the company s total assets and net assets were  and  at december   respectively  versus  and  at december   respectively 
the decrease is primarily owing to the payment of a one time cash dividend of  to meet one of the company s requirements for qualification for sub chapter m treatment  the payment of the company s outstanding balance on the demand promissory note of  which reduced the company s total assets in  and the decrease of  as a result of operations 
see statement of operations contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
net asset value per share nav was at december   versus at december  nav was reduced by the cash dividend paid by the company in the company s shares outstanding as of december  were  versus  at december  the company s outstanding shares were reduced as a result of its repurchase in the open market of a total of  shares as of december  however  the treasury shares were then decreased by purchases of company stock by directors with percent of their director compensation 
see note of notes to financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the company s financial condition is dependent on the success of its investments 
the company has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth or have no history of operations 
at december    or percent of the company s total assets consisted of investments at fair value in private businesses  of which net unrealized appreciation was  before taxes 
at december    or percent of the company s total assets consisted of investments at fair value in private businesses  of which net unrealized appreciation was  before taxes 
the increase in the percentage of private investments from percent in to percent in is primarily owing to an increase in the value of several private investments  the payment of the company s outstanding balance on the demand promissory note of  which reduced the company s total assets in  the decrease of  as a result of operations see statement of operations contained in item financial statements and supplementary data  and the payment of a one time cash dividend of  to meet one of the company s requirements for qualification for sub chapter m treatment 
a summary of the company s investment portfolio is as follows december  december  investments  at cost   unrealized appreciation   investments  at fair value   the accumulated unrealized appreciation on investments net of deferred taxes is  at december   versus  at december  following an initial investment in a private company  the company may make additional investments in such investee in order to increase its ownership percentage  exercise warrants or options that were acquired in a prior financing  preserve the company s proportionate ownership in a subsequent financing  or attempt to preserve or enhance the value of the company s investment 
such additional investments are referred to as follow on investments 
there can be no assurance that the company will make follow on investments or have sufficient funds to make additional investments 
the failure to make such follow on investments could jeopardize the viability of the investee company and the company s investment or could result in a missed opportunity for the company to participate to a greater extent in an investee s successful operations 
the company attempts to maintain adequate liquid capital to make follow on investments in its private investee portfolio companies 
the company may elect not to make a follow on investment either because it does not want to increase its concentration of risk  because it prefers other opportunities  or because it is inhibited by compliance with bdc or ric requirements  even though the follow on investment opportunity appears attractive

results of operations investment income and expenses the company had a net operating loss of  in   in and  in the company s investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation rather than current income from its investments 
therefore  a significant portion of the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the potential for capital appreciation and provides little or no current yield in the form of dividends or interest 
the company does earn interest income from fixed income securities  including us government obligations 
the amount of interest income earned varies based upon the average balance of the company s fixed income portfolio and the total average yield on this portfolio

to date  no actual payments have been made under the company s profit sharing plan 
the company has in the past relied  and continues to rely to a large extent  upon proceeds from sales of investments  rather than investment income  to defray a significant portion of its operating expenses 
because such sales cannot be predicted with certainty  the company attempts to maintain adequate working capital to provide for fiscal periods when there are no such sales

as of december   the company had a  line of credit in place with jp morgan  on which the company had no outstanding balance 
management believes that its cash  receivables and marketable securities provide the company with sufficient liquidity for its operations over the next months 
on february   nbx corporation announced that it had agreed to be acquired by com corporation for approximately million in cash plus additional consideration for employees of nbx 
this transaction was effective on march  and closed on march  on closing  the company received a total of  in cash  of which  was placed in a one year escrow 
on february   the board of directors of the company declared a cash dividend of per share approximately million to shareholders of record on march   payable on march  see note of notes to financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
recent developments sub chapter m status on september   the company s board of directors approved a proposal to seek qualification of the company as a ric under sub chapter m of the code 
in order to qualify as a ric  the company must  in general annually derive at least percent of its gross income from dividends  interest and gains from the sale of securities  quarterly meet certain investment diversification requirements  and annually distribute at least percent of its investment company taxable income as a dividend 
in addition to the requirement that the company must annually distribute at least percent of its investment company taxable income  the company may either distribute or retain its taxable net capital gains from investments  but any net capital gains not distributed could be subject to corporate level tax 
further  the company could be subject to a four percent excise tax and in some cases  corporate level income tax if it fails to distribute percent of its annual taxable income 
because of the specialized nature of its investment portfolio  the company could satisfy the diversification requirements under sub chapter m of the code only if it received a certification from the sec that it is principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions  technological improvements  new processes  or products not previously generally available 
on april   the company announced that it had received such a certification from the sec for pursuant to the company s receipt of the certification  the company s board of directors declared and paid a one time cash dividend of per share to meet one of the company s requirements for qualification for sub chapter m tax treatment 
on february   the company received rulings from the irs regarding other issues relevant to the company s tax status as a ric 
see note of notes to financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
although the sec certification for was issued  there can be no assurance that the company will receive such certification for or subsequent years to the extent it needs additional certification as a result of changes in its portfolio or that it will qualify as a ric in or that  if it does qualify in  it will continue to qualify in subsequent years 
the qualification of the company as a ric under sub chapter m of the code depends on it satisfying certain technical requirements regarding its income  investment portfolio  and distributions 
the company was unable to satisfy these requirements for the tax year owing to the nature of the company s ownership interest in one of its investee companies 
in addition  because it realized taxable losses in  it was not strategically advantageous for the company to elect sub chapter m tax status for the company changed the nature of its ownership interest in the non qualifying investee company effective january  in order to meet the sub chapter m requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for sub chapter m treatment for or subsequent years 
in addition  under certain circumstances  even if the company were qualified for sub chapter m treatment in and elected sub chapter m treatment for that year  the company might take action in a subsequent year to ensure that it would be taxed in that subsequent year as a c corporation  rather than a ric 
the company incurred ordinary and capital losses during its c corporation taxable years that remain available for use and may be carried forward to its and subsequent taxable years 
ordinarily  a corporation that elects to qualify as a ric may not use its ordinary loss carryforwards from c corporation taxable years to offset ric investment company taxable income  although a ric may in certain cases use capital loss carryforwards to reduce net capital gains 
in addition  a c corporation that elects to qualify as a ric and that makes an appropriate election continues to be taxable as a c corporation on any gains realized within years of its qualification as a ric from sales of assets that were held by the corporation on the effective date of the election c corporation assets to the extent of any gain built into the assets on such date built in gain 
on february   the company received a ruling from the irs concluding that the company can carry forward its c corporation losses to offset any built in gains resulting from sales of its c corporation assets 
that ruling may enable the company to retain some or all of the proceeds from such sales without disqualifying itself as a ric or incurring corporate level income tax  depending on whether the company s sale of c corporation assets with built in gains will generate c corporation e p 
in general  a ric is not permitted to have  as of the close of any ric taxable year  e p accumulated during any c corporation taxable year 
however  because the realization of built in gains will occur while the company is a ric  a strong argument exists that  under current law and irs pronouncements  the sale of c corporation assets with built in gains during ric taxable years will not generate c corporation e p 
the company intends to use the million loss carryforward which results in a tax credit of approximately million to reduce the taxes due to built in gains 
the december  nav includes the utilization of the ordinary and capital loss carryforwards of approximately per share 
the irs recently announced an intention to issue formal guidance in concerning conversions of c corporation to rics 
such guidance may include resolution of the e p issue described above and other issues relevant to the company 
if necessary for liquidity purposes or to fund investment opportunities  in lieu of distributing its taxable net capital gains  the company may retain such net capital gains and elect to be deemed to have made a distribution of the gains  or part thereof  to the shareholders under the designated undistributed capital gain rules of section b of the code 
in such a case  the company would have to pay a percent corporate level income tax on such designated undistributed capital gain  but it would not have to distribute the excess of the retained designated undistributed capital gain over the amount of tax thereon in order to maintain its ric status 
tax consequences of net capital gains the following simplified examples illustrate the tax treatment under sub chapter m of the code for the company and its shareholders with regard to three possible alternatives  assuming a net long term capital gain of per share  consisting entirely of sales of non real property assets held for more than months 
under alternative a percent of net capital gain declared as a dividend and distributed to shareholders no taxation at the company level 
shareholders receive a per share dividend and pay a maximum tax of percent or 
per share  retaining 
per share 
under alternative b percent of net capital gain retained by the company and designated as undistributed capital gain dividend the company pays a corporate level income tax of percent on the undistributed gain or 
per share and retains percent of the gain or 
per share 
shareholders increase their cost basis in their stock by 
per share 
they pay a percent capital gains tax on percent of the undistributed gain of per share or 
per share in tax 
offsetting this tax  shareholders receive a tax credit equal to percent of the undistributed gain or 
per share 
under alternative c percent of net capital gain retained by the company  with no designated undistributed capital gain dividend the company pays a corporate level income tax of percent on the retained gain or 
per share plus an excise tax of percent of 
per share  or about 
per share 
there is no tax consequence at the shareholder level 
assumes all capital gains qualify for long term rates of percent 
risk factors investment in small  private companies there are significant risks inherent in the company s venture capital business 
the company has invested a substantial portion of its assets in private development stage or start up companies 
these private businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth and have not attained profitability or have no history of operations 
because of the speculative nature and the lack of a public market for these investments  there is significantly greater risk of loss than is the case with traditional investment securities 
the company expects that some of its venture capital investments will be a complete loss or will be unprofitable and that some will appear to be likely to become successful but never realize their potential 
the company has been risk seeking rather than risk averse in its approach to venture capital and other investments 
neither the company s investments nor an investment in the company is intended to constitute a balanced investment program 
the company has in the past relied and continues to rely to a large extent upon proceeds from sales of investments rather than investment income to defray a significant portion of its operating expenses 
valuation of portfolio investments there is typically no public market of equity securities of the small private companies in which the company invests 
as a result  the valuation of the equity securities in the company s portfolio is subject to the good faith estimate of the company s board of directors 
see asset valuation policy guidelines in footnote to schedule of investments 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of equity securities may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity securities existed 
any changes in estimated net asset value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as change in unrealized appreciation on investments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
illiquidity of portfolio investments most of the investments of the company are or will be equity securities acquired directly from small companies 
the company s portfolio of equity securities are and will usually be subject to restrictions on resale or otherwise have no established trading market 
the illiquidity of most of the company s portfolio of equity securities may adversely affect the ability of the company to dispose of such securities at times when it may be advantageous for the company to liquidate such investments 
fluctuations of quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results could fluctuate as a result of a number of factors 
these include  among others  variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses  the degree to which the company encounters competition in its markets and general economic conditions 
as a result of these factors  results for any one quarter should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future quarters 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk of loss of pass through tax treatment if the company meets certain diversification and distribution requirements under the code  it may qualify as a ric under the code for pass through tax treatment 
the company would cease to qualify for pass through tax treatment if it were unable to comply with these requirements  or if it ceased to qualify as a bdc under the act 
the company also could be subject to a four percent excise tax and  in certain cases  corporate level income tax if it failed to make certain distributions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition recent developments sub chapter m status 
the lack of sub chapter m taxtreatment could have a material adverse effect on the total return  if any  obtainable from an investment in the company 
if the company fails to qualify as a ric  the company would become subject to federal income tax as if it were an ordinary c corporation  which would result in a substantial reduction in the company s net assets and the amount of income available for distribution to the company s stockholders 
risks relating to the year issue the year computer problem has arisen because many computer applications worldwide will not properly recognize the date change from december   to january  the computer applications may revert to or some other date because of the way in which dates were encoded and calculated  potentially causing production of erroneous data  miscalculations  system failures and other operational problems 
the company has undertaken the evaluation of the year impact on its critical computer hardware and software 
the company has not incurred  nor does it anticipate that it will incur  any material cost in addressing its year problem 
the company is developing a strategic plan focusing on achieving year compliance 
certain systems are being replaced and or modified to be year compliant 
at the present time  it is not possible to determine whether any such events are likely to occur or to quantify any potential negative impact they may have on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
ultimately  the potential impact of the year issue will depend not only on the success of the corrective measures undertaken by the company  but also on the way in which the year issue is addressed by vendors  service providers  counterparties  utilities  governmental agencies and other entities with which the company does business
