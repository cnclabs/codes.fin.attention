item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview as the company projected in its fiscal year annual report  both the us and export markets for lindsay s center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment registered a decline in revenues in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to lower average agricultural commodity prices 
diversified products revenues for the year were also negatively influenced by these lower agricultural commodity prices 
in total  the company s operating revenues in fiscal year were percent lower than its operating revenues in fiscal year net earnings for fiscal year of million were percent lower than fiscal year s net earnings of million  excluding the benefit of a third quarter fiscal year gain of million million after tax from a litigation settlement 
during fiscal year  lindsay repurchased  shares of its common stock for a total of million 
the company s balance sheet features no long term debt and strong financial ratios

fiscal year s us irrigation equipment revenues totaled million  percent lower than fiscal year s revenue from us irrigation equipment of million 
fiscal year s export irrigation equipment revenues totaled million and were percent lower than fiscal s export irrigation equipment revenue of million 
diversified product revenues totaled million in fiscal year  a percent reduction compared to fiscal year s diversified product revenues of million 
other revenues  primarily consisting of revenues from long haul over the road freight services  are included in the irrigation equipment segment in the table above and totaled million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year demand in the us market for almost all agricultural related capital equipment  including center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment  began to slow during lindsay s fourth quarter of fiscal year due to lower agricultural commodity prices and anticipated lower farm income 
this comparatively slow demand for center pivots and lateral move irrigation equipment continued into lindsay s first and second quarter of fiscal year as farmers postponed capital equipment purchases 
nearly all of fiscal year s reduction in us center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment revenues occurred during lindsay s first two quarters of the fiscal year 
demand in the export market for center pivot and lateral move equipment during fiscal year was negatively influenced by the same low agricultural commodity price factor as the us market 
additionally  export irrigation equipment sales were hurt by the strength of the us dollar relative to certain other currencies  particularly those of western europe 
a million sale for a project in romania during lindsay s fiscal third quarter offset a portion of the overall reduction in export sales revenue for fiscal year fiscal year s reduction in diversified products revenues was the result of a lower level of sales for both lindsay s large diameter thin wall steel tubing products and for the company s outsource manufacturing services 
caterpillar inc  deere company  and new holland north america  inc 
each continue to be significant outsource manufacturing customers 
at august   lindsay s order backlog for irrigation equipment was million  an increase of percent from million at august  lindsay s august  order backlog for diversified products was million  a percent decline from million at august  lindsay s total order backlog at august  was million  a modest increase from million of august  gross margin fiscal year s manufacturing throughput was lower than that of fiscal year as a result of both center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment demand and revenues and diversified products demand and revenues being lower in fiscal year than in fiscal year despite this lower manufacturing throughput and the resulting unfavorable overhead variances  lindsay was able to maintain the majority of its gross margin 
this was accomplished largely due to good cost controls  soft raw material prices and continued automation and production improvements 
the company attained a gross margin of percent in fiscal year  which compares only modestly unfavorably with a gross margin of percent posted in fiscal year when the company had significantly higher factory throughput 
operating expenses fiscal year s selling  engineering and research and general and administrative sg a expenses of million were only slightly lower than fiscal year s sg a expenses of million 
increased sg a depreciation  legal fees and group insurance expenses during the year were more than offset by reduced salary and wage and employee and dealer travel costs 
interest income  other income and taxes the company s interest income is primarily generated from its investments in short term to months and intermediate term to month investment grade municipal bonds  on which interest earnings are exempt from federal income taxes  and short term investment grade commercial paper 
fiscal year interest income was million  modestly lower than fiscal year s interest income of million 
fiscal year s other income of million was equal to fiscal year s million  after adjusting fiscal year s other income for the recognition of million due to an agreement that the company reached with an insurer to settle litigation which lindsay initiated in lindsay s fiscal year effective tax rate was reduced to percent from a percent rate for fiscal year the fiscal year reduction in the effective rate was the result of a larger portion of the company s pre tax earnings coming from municipal bond interest exempt from federal income taxes in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year when the company s municipal bond interest represented percent of lindsay s pre tax earnings 
in addition to the federal tax free status on municipal bond interest income  the company currently benefits and expects to continue to benefit from the foreign sales corporation federal tax provisions as they relate to export sales  and to state of nebraska economic development tax credits

domestic irrigation equipment revenues increased to million from million in fiscal year fiscal year export irrigation equipment revenues at million were lower than fiscal year s million 
diversified product revenues totaled million in fiscal year  lower than fiscal year s million 
other revenues  primarily consisting of revenues from freight services  are included with the irrigation equipment segment in the above table and totaled million in each of fiscal years and the us market for center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment grew during the first three quarters of fiscal year during the fourth quarter  however lower crop and other agricultural commodity prices raised farmer concern about farm income 
as a result  demand for center pivot and lateral move irrigation slowed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal year export irrigation equipment revenues were negatively impacted by a strong us dollar throughout most of the year  particularly in the company s western european and south african markets 
additionally  an abnormally wet spring in lindsay s primary latin american market reduced sales activity 
fiscal year s reduction in diversified products revenues was the result of lower sales of both lindsay s large diameter steel tubing and outsource manufacturing services 
major outsource manufacturing customers during the year were caterpillar inc  deere company  and new holland north america  inc at august   lindsay s order backlog for irrigation equipment was million  down significantly from million at august  lindsay s august   order backlog for diversified products was million as compared to million at august  gross margin fiscal year gross margin of improved from gross margins of in fiscal year and in fiscal year gross margin for fiscal year was favorably influenced by increased automation resulting in improved productivity and efficiencies and by continued strong demand during most of the year in the us market for irrigation equipment which yielded a continued favorable pricing environment 
raw material costs  in total  continued to be relatively stable 
operating expenses selling  engineering and research  and general and administrative expenses grew in fiscal year  totaling million as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increases in wage  salary and benefit costs including group health insurance and increased advertising and dealer promotion expenditures partially offset by lower legal fee costs 
interest income  other income and taxes fiscal year interest income of million is up slightly from million in fiscal year fiscal year other income of million included income of million due to an agreement the company reached with an insurer to settle litigation which lindsay initiated in lindsay s fiscal year effective tax rate decreased to from for fiscal year the company benefited from the foreign sales corporation federal tax provisions as they relate to export sales  the federal tax free status of interest earned from its municipal investments and state of nebraska economic development tax credits 
financial position and liquidity the discussion of financial position and liquidity focuses on the balance sheet and statement of cash flows 
lindsay requires cash for financing its receivables  inventories  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and dividends 
over the years  lindsay has financed its growth through funds provided by operations 
cash flows provided by operations totaled million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year were primarily due to net earnings  decreased receivables and decreased inventories 
fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were principally due to net earnings and a reduction in receivables 
receivables at august   decreased million to million from million  which was primarily due to reduced sales activity during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
inventories of million at august   decreased from million at august  inventory was reduced by using improved inventory planning systems and criteria 
current liabilities of million at august   were equal to million at august  cash flows provided by investing activities of million for fiscal year compared to million used in fiscal year the cash flows provided by investing activities in fiscal year were primarily due to maturities of marketable securities partially offset by capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities 
fiscal year cash flows used in investing activities were primarily attributable to purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from marketable securities 
lindsay s cash and short term marketable securities totaled million at august  as compared to million at august  at august   lindsay had million invested in long term marketable securities which represent intermediate term to months maturities municipal debt  as compared to million at august  cash flows used in financing activities of million for fiscal year increased from million in fiscal year and for both periods was primarily attributable to dividends paid and to purchases of treasury stock partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option plans 
capital expenditures of million during fiscal year decreased from million in fiscal year fiscal year capital expenditures were used primarily for a new employee breakroom and office renovation and expansion  routine replacement and updating of production equipment and additional work on converting a major fabrication process started in fiscal year to further automate lindsay s facility 
capital expenditures for fiscal year are expected to be approximately to million and will be used to improve the company s existing facilities  expand its manufacturing capabilities and increase productivity 
depreciation totaled million in fiscal and is expected to increase to approximately million in fiscal year lindsay expended million in fiscal to repurchase  shares of its common stock 
in fiscal year  lindsay repurchased  shares of its common stock for million 
lindsay believes its capitalization including cash and marketable securities balances and operating cash flow are sufficient to cover expected working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  dividends and repurchases of common stock 
fiscal outlook irrigation equipment assuming flat agricultural commodity pricing  the company expects results for fiscal year to approximate those of fiscal year for fiscal year lindsay expects easier comparisons in its first and second quarters  tougher comparisons in its third quarter and similar performance in its fourth quarter  versus the prior year periods 
in september  lindsay began fiscal year with farmers somewhat dismayed over the significant drop in agricultural commodity prices 
for some farmers  the anticipation of lower prices and lower income meant fewer capital expenditures  for others it only delayed their purchase decision until lindsay s third quarter when they were better able to assess their financial health 
this effect on timing is evident in the company s irrigation equipment august  backlog  which is up percent compared with that at august  presenting the company with the foundation for a stronger fiscal year first half 
lindsay believes agricultural commodity prices have bottomed and that there is more upside potential than downside risk in agricultural commodity prices 
the question is when prices and the agricultural equipment industry will recover 
the company will continue to employ its proven long term growth strategy to successfully weather the near term climate through ongoing investment in leading edge zimmatic products  a strong dealer network and its efficient manufacturing operations 
longer term  lindsay believes that the desire of us farmers to reduce variable input costs  stabilize or increase crop yields  reduce labor input and conserve water and energy will continue to drive demand for center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment 
the company believes that these demand drivers will result in long term growth in us demand for its irrigation equipment to average in the to per annum range 
export sales of center pivot and lateral move irrigation equipment in fiscal year are expected to be roughly flat with fiscal year s million 
lindsay expects the majority of its fiscal year export sales to come from canada  mexico and latin america  australia  central and western europe and south and central africa 
lindsay s domestic and international irrigation equipment sales are highly dependent upon the need for irrigated agricultural production which  in turn  depends upon many factors including total worldwide crop production  the profitability of agricultural production  agricultural commodity prices  aggregate net cash farm income  governmental policies regarding the agricultural sector  water and energy conservation policies and the regularity of rainfall 
approximately  and of lindsay s revenues were generated from export sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
lindsay does not believe it has significant exposure to foreign currency translation risks because its export sales are all in us dollars and are generally all shipped against prepayments or us bank confirmed irrevocable letters of credit or other secured means 
diversified products lindsay s diversified products segment consists of two major products large diameter thin wall round steel tubing and outsource manufacturing services 
diversified products customers for both products primarily consist of agricultural and industrial capital goods manufacturers 
because of the ag related component  lindsay believes that its diversified product revenues will most likely improve slightly in fiscal year compared to fiscal year lindsay s long term goal has been  and continues to be  to build its diversified products segment to total to of total annual revenues 
seasonality irrigation equipment sales are seasonal by nature 
farmers generally order systems to be delivered and installed before the growing season 
shipments to us customers usually peak during lindsay s second and third quarters for the spring planting period 
lindsay s expansion into diversified products complements its irrigation operations by using available capacity and reducing seasonality 
year issues during late fiscal year  the company began to address year issues with its information technology it systems with a decision to replace its in house developed manufacturing and financial software with year compliant standardized enterprise resource planning erp software 
management selected system software associates  inc s bpcs erp software in early hardware procurement and bpcs erp software implementation progressed during fiscal years  and implementation of the manufacturing modules of this bpcs erp software is complete with optimization work continuing 
implementation of the financial modules of the bpcs erp software will be undertaken in late fiscal year or in fiscal year additionally  the company  in march  commenced a more comprehensive review of its year issues with the formation of a year task force 
this task force has inventoried and assessed both its it and non it systems embedded technology such as microcontrollers or programmable logic controllers in manufacturing equipment or in the products lindsay sells 
the task force has also inventoried  assessed and confirmed the year compliance status of the company s critical suppliers and third party providers 
the company believes that to of the remediation work to become year compliant has been completed  however final testing is continuing 
lindsay believes that it has addressed its year issues for all mission critical components and that it will have fully addressed year issues by the end of december for non mission critical components 
lindsay believes that its costs for becoming year compliant are expected to total approximately million of which has been incurred to date approximately million in both fiscal years and and million in fiscal year 
these costs include hardware costs  software costs and outside consulting costs but do not include the costs for time that its employees have or are expected to spend on year issues 
the company believes that its most reasonable likely worst case year scenario includes a short term interruption in its ability to manufacture and ship product because one or more of the company s suppliers or third party providers are unable to provide the material or services expected  and one or more parts of the company s it system software or non it systems operate incorrectly 
because of the progress which has been made toward achieving year compliance  the company has not made specific formal contingency plans 
however  informal contingency plans have been made 
if knowledge of outside providers noncompliance becomes evident or events occur that are adverse to the company s plan for compliance  the company will develop and implement specific formal contingency plans as required 
despite the company s efforts to address its year issues  there can be no assurances that year related failures of the company s it or non it systems  or that year related failures by suppliers or third parties with which the company interacts  will not have a material adverse effect on the company
