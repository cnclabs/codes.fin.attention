item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
description of forward looking statements 
this portion of this annual report contains forward looking statements relating to o revenues  o capital resources sufficiency  and o gross margins  o market risk 
o expenditures on research and development  selling and administration  actual results may differ from those projected in the forward looking statements for a number of reasons  including those described in factors you should consider before investing in pmc sierra 
we present projected project revenue estimates in the in process research and development section of item of this report 
these estimates were made solely for the purposes of accounting for the acquisition of integrated telecom technology inc see below and should not be construed as a projection of expected future performance of products resulting from these projects 
general 
we design  develop  market and support high performance semiconductor solutions for advanced telecommunications and data communications networking markets 
our products are silicon based and are used in the broadband communications infrastructure and high bandwidth networks 
we supply atm  sonet sdh  t e  d e and ethernet semiconductors 
in the second quarter of  we expanded our portfolio of atm layer and switching products by acquiring integrated telecom technology inc igt 
igt was a fabless semiconductor company headquartered in gaithersburg  md 
igt also had a development site in san jose  ca 
igt made atm switching chipsets for wide area network applications as well as atm segmentation and reassembly and other telecommunication chips 
the total consideration of million paid to acquire igt consisted of cash paid to igt shareholders of million  cash paid to igt creditors of million  and the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock and options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the purchase price also included  in professional fees and other direct acquisition costs 
as part of the purchase  we acquired million cash and million of other tangible assets  and assumed igt s current liabilities of million and interest bearing capital lease obligations valued at million see note of the consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to issuing our quarterly report on form q for the period ended june   the securities and exchange commission sec released new information to the market regarding acceptable methodologies for valuing in process research and development ipr d in purchase transactions 
in light of this new information  we revalued certain identifiable assets acquired through the igt acquisition 
our initial valuation of the igt ipr d was done using a methodology that focused on the aggregate after tax cash flows attributable to the purchased technology 
using the sec s guidelines  we subsequently considered the stage of completion of individual projects and the risk associated with the stage of completion of the technology 
as a result of these additional considerations  we restated our financial statements for the six month periods ended june  to reflect the revaluation of assets acquired and to record the revised amounts for intangible assets  goodwill  and ipr d see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also restated our financial statements for the period ended september   to reflect the impairment of a portion of the restated intangible assets recognized in connection with the igt acquisition 
during the third quarter  we terminated development work on a project 
we determined that the developed and core technology related to this project was not technologically feasible and had no alternative future use 
as a result  we restated goodwill  core technology  and related amortization from amounts initially reported and recorded an impairment of intangible assets of million 
in august  we announced our decision to exit the personal computer modem chipset business  restructure our other non networking products and focus on our networking products 
in  we recorded a charge of million in connection with this decision 
we completed all material aspects of the restructuring by the end of at that time  we recorded a recovery of million from the reversal of the excess accrued restructure charge see note to consolidated financial statements 
also in  we acquired ethernet switching assets  intellectual property and certain other assets from bipolar integrated technology bit 
we acquired these assets in exchange for  shares of common stock and other consideration 
the aggregate value of this transaction was approximately million including the acquisition costs we incurred 
results of operations net revenues  change change networking products non networking other non networking modem total net revenues net revenues increased in as the growth in networking product revenue exceeded the reduction of revenues from non networking products 
networking product revenue grew in and in as a result of a strong market for our customers broadband equipment due to the growth of the internet and data communications in general  the move of many equipment manufacturers from custom integrated circuits to application specific standard products and revenue from products acquired in connection with the igt acquisition 
non networking other revenues  which include custom  graphic  and other semiconductor revenues  declined in compared to and declined in compared to this reflects our strategic decision to restructure our other non networking business and to focus on networking semiconductor business 
we are supporting non networking products for existing customers  but have decided not to develop any further products of this type 
we expect the non networking revenues to continue to decline rapidly in consistent with our restructuring  we exited the modem chipset business and sold all our modem chipset inventories in no future revenues are expected from that business 
gross profit  change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking reveunes total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit increased from to and from to because increased sales of higher gross margin networking products offset a decline in gross profit due to lower revenues from non networking products 
in addition  lower wafer costs increased gross profit in relative to networking gross profit in  as a percentage of revenues  was consistent with the gross margins of these products were high relative to overall gross margins in the semiconductor industry because our chips are highly complex and are sold in relatively low volumes 
in fact  in  none of our networking products accounted for more than of networking revenue 
we believe that  as the market for our networking products grows and customers purchase in greater volumes  gross profit as a percentage of revenues will decline 
we expect networking gross margins to decline if reductions in production costs do not sufficiently offset decreases in average selling prices of existing networking products  or increases in gross profit contributed by new higher gross margin networking products do not sufficiently offset decreases in average selling prices of existing networking products 
non networking gross profit decreased by in compared to non networking gross profit as a percentage of sales declined from in to in in  we expect gross profit from non networking products to decrease in total dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the continuation of non networking gross profit decline results from our decision to exit the modem chipset business and restructure our other non networking business 
non networking product gross profit was higher in than due to the sales related to our modem chipset inventories 
in  our reserve for write down of the modem chipset inventory to market included both completion and disposal costs 
the higher amount of gross profit recognized during represents the reduction in the reserve for write down to the extent necessary to cover the relatively higher period expenses incurred relating to the disposal effort 
there was no overall operating profit from the sale of modem chipset products in other costs and expenses  change change research and development percentage of net revenues marketing  general administrative percentage of net revenues in process research development acquired percentage of net revenues impairment of intangible assets percentage of net revenues restructure and other costs percentage of net revenues research and development and marketing  general and administrative expenses 
in  research and development r d expenses increased by overall  to of total revenue 
substantially all r d activity carried out in related to networking products 
our increased r d spending is a response to the array of opportunities presented by the growth of the internet  data networking and the convergence of voice and data communications 
we incur r d expenditures in order to attain technological leadership from a multi year perspective 
this has caused r d spending to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we expect such fluctuations  particularly when measured as a percentage of net revenues  to occur in the future  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and changes in the level of net revenues 
in the future  we expect r d expenses to increase and relate entirely to networking products 
r d expenditures decreased in compared to because we discontinued work on non networking products 
this was partially offset by an increase in spending on networking products 
for all periods presented  r d expenditures as a percentage of net revenue were higher for networking products than for non networking products 
in  we increased total marketing  general and administrative expenses but decreased the expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
from a short term perspective  many marketing  general and administrative expenses are fixed 
therefore  during periods of rising revenues  these expenses decline as a percentage of revenues 
the opposite holds true in periods of declining revenues 
we expect marketing  general and administrative costs to increase during and beyond 
marketing  general and administrative expenses declined in primarily due to the reduction in expenses and personnel resulting from the restructuring of the non networking operations 
the increase in these expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects increased spending on networking products and a decline in total net revenues 
in process research and development ipr d 
ipr d expenses of million include million related to the acquisition of igt and million related to the acquisition of technology which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in our allocation of the igt acquisition purchase price to ipr d  we considered the following for each in process project at the time of the acquisition the present value of forecasted cash flows and income that were expected to result from the projects  the status of projects  completion costs  project risks  the value of core technology  and the stage of completion of the individual project 
in valuing the core technology  we ensured that the relative allocations to core technology and ipr d were consistent with the relative contributions of each 
in the determination of the value of ipr d  we ensured that the value of ipr d only considered efforts completed as of the date igt was acquired 
the amount allocated to ipr d of million was expensed upon acquisition  as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and successful development was uncertain 
as of the acquisition date  igt had three development projects in process 
in order to develop these projects into commercially viable products  we had to complete all planning  designing and testing activities necessary to establish that the products could be produced to meet their design requirements 
the calculations of value assigned to the ipr d reflect the efforts of igt prior to the close of the acquisition 
the estimated completion percentage  estimated technology life and projected introduction date of the three development projects as of the acquisition date were as follows percent technology introduction project completed life date project a years project b years project c years project a relates to the development of an atm switching system 
projects b and c relate to the segmentation and reassembly sar of data in an atm network 
a brief description of the valuation of each in process project is set forth below revenue we used discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income stream of related product sales to compute the value of each acquired in process technology 
we determined the value assigned to purchased in process technology by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
we based the revenue projection on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of our and our competitors new product introductions 
these estimates were made solely for the purposes of accounting for the igt acquisition and should not be construed as a projection of expected future performance of products resulting from these projects 
we estimated that these in process projects would begin generating revenue in we estimated that revenues would generate revenue for to years and then decline sharply as we expect that other new products and technologies would enter the market 
cost to complete we estimated that total research and development costs to complete the three projects would amount to million over a twelve month period 
expenses we included selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in our operating expense estimates 
we based these estimates on historical results and anticipated cost savings 
due to general economies of scale  improved infrastructure  and greater management breadth  we expected operating expense as a percentage of revenues to decrease after the acquisition 
we estimated cost of sales  expressed as a percentage of revenue  for the developed and in process technologies to be increasing to for all three projects 
we estimated selling  general and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenue for the developed and in process technologies  would be in and would decrease to by research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with activities undertaken to develop new versions and to correct errors or to keep products updated with current information 
we estimated r d expense would be of revenues in and would decline to of revenues by we used an effective income tax rate of throughout the valuation period 
the reflects our estimated combined federal and state statutory income tax rate  exclusive of nonrecurring charges  and our estimated future income tax provision rate 
in valuing the ipr d  we used the following discount rates project a project b project c we considered the weighted average cost of capital when selecting an appropriate discount rate 
to determine this  we used a capital asset pricing model and reviewed venture capital rates of return 
the discount rate we used for the in process technology was higher than our weighted average cost of capital due to the risk of realizing cash flows from products that had yet to reach technological feasibility as of the valuation date 
allocation of value we allocated the fair market values of the assets acquired from igt as follows asset fair market value intellectual property in process research and development project a  project b  project c  developed and core technology  assembled workforce  goodwill  comparison to actual results we believed that the assumptions we used in the valuation of the acquired intangible igt assets were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
however  we had no assurance that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  would transpire as estimated 
project a development was completed  and prototypes were in production  on the date we filed this annual report 
we completed development of project b in the fourth quarter of we were in full production as of the date we filed this annual report 
this was consistent with our initial estimates used in the valuation of the project 
we terminated development on project c during the third quarter see impairment of intangible assets of if project a does not reach full production  or if the products from project a or b are not accepted by the market  then there will be a loss of the expected return inherent in the fair value allocation and the associated intangible assets would be impaired 
this may require us to shorten the time period over which the related assets would be amortized  which may impact our operating results materially and adversely 
ipr d incurred in relate to the acquisition of the ethernet switching and other assets from bit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets 
during the third quarter of  we abandoned a development project 
we determined that a portion of the restated intangible assets recognized in connection with the igt acquisition was impaired 
the terminated project related to ongoing development of a sar chip used to convert data packets to asynchronous transfer mode data cells refer to project c in in process research and development above 
the few customers who were using a predecessor chip were notified of the termination of all future development of this technology 
the technology was specialized and has no alternative future use 
restructure and other costs 
in  we recorded a charge of million in connection with our decision to exit from the modem chipset business and restructure other non networking product operations 
all material aspects of the restructuring were completed by the end of at that time  we recorded a recovery of million from the reversal of the excess accrued restructure charge 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net  change change interest income  net percentage of net revenues interest income increased in  and due to higher cash balances available to invest and earn interest 
interest expense decreased in due to the retirement of debt associated with capital leases 
this reduction was partially offset by additional interest expense related to the assumption of capital leases in our acquisition of igt 
provision for income taxes 
our and income tax provision primarily reflects the provision for income taxes for the canadian subsidiary 
our us taxes for and were largely eliminated by tax losses realized from our restructuring charge 
the million charge for ipr d and the related million impairment of intangible assets taken in are non deductible and will not result in any future tax benefits 
the income tax rate reflects taxes on our foreign operations and the effect of a non deductible million charge for the purchase of ipr d relating to the bit acquisition 
we used net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards to reduce the us tax provision 
we did not recognize a tax benefit from the restructure charge of million because of the uncertainty of future taxable income in the united states 
recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we expect to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require the recognition of all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
we anticipate that the adoption of this statement will not have a significant effect on our operating results or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased from million at the end of to million at the end of during  operating activities provided million in cash 
the net loss of million in includes non cash charges of million in depreciation and amortization  a million charge for in process research and development and a million charge for impairment of intangible assets 
during  our investing activities included million of net cash consumed in the acquisition of igt and million in purchases of new plant and equipment 
we also used cash to increase short term investments by a net of million and to repay million of our debt and capital lease obligations 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock  principally under our stock option and purchase plans  totaled million 
as at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a new line of credit agreement with a bank 
this agreement allows us to borrow up to million 
we cannot pay cash dividends  or make material divestments  without the prior written consent of the bank 
there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit at the end of either or we have supply agreements with two independent foundries that supply substantially all of the wafers for our products 
we have made deposits to secure access to wafer fabrication capacity under these agreements 
at december  and  we had and million  respectively  in deposits with those foundries and we were in compliance with our foundry agreements 
there are no minimum unit volume requirements in these agreements 
we are obliged under one of the agreements to purchase a minimum percentage of our total annual wafer requirements provided that the foundry is able to continue to offer competitive technology  pricing  quality and delivery 
the agreements may be terminated if either party does not comply with the terms 
we purchased million in wafers from our foundry suppliers during compared to million in those amounts may not be indicative of any future period since wafer prices and our volume requirements may change 
in each year  we are entitled to receive a refund of a portion of these deposits 
the amount to be received is based on the annual purchases from those foundries compared to the target levels in the agreements 
based on purchases  we expect to receive a million refund from one of the foundries in the first quarter of if we do not receive our deposits back during the course of the agreements  then they will be returned to us at the end of the agreement periods 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of we expect to purchase or arrange capital leases for approximately million of new capital expenditures during in  actual capital expenditures totaled million 
no additional deposits to secure foundry capacity are expected in factors that you should consider before investing in pmc sierra our company is subject to a number of risks some are normal to the fabless networking semiconductor industry  some are the same or similar to those disclosed in previous sec filings  and some may be present in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
our operating results fluctuate our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future for any of the following reasons o our product introduction timing  o our average selling prices change  o our customers inventory levels o our customers are acquired or fluctuate  divested  o demand for our and our customers o a networking industry downturn  products changes  o our suppliers product and capacity o we are unable to acquire wafer or availability changes  other manufacturing capacity  o our product manufacturing yields o our competitors produce new products change  or technologies  o market acceptance or rejection of one o our product and process development or more of our products  expenditures change  and o our competitors change prices 
we may be left with unsaleable inventory we attempt to forecast and maintain a level of inventory in anticipation of demand for our products 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and demand for their end user networking equipment 
if our customers were to delay  cancel or otherwise change future ordering patterns  we could be left with unwanted inventory 
we anticipate lower margins on mature and high volume products our gross and operating margins may change in the future as a result of any of the following o changes in average selling prices  o changes in production and wafer and other supply costs  and o changes in our product mix 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices asps of products 
if we price our products too high  our customers may use a competitor s product or an in house solution 
thus  our asps will generally fall with the industry norms 
to maintain profit margins  we must reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in asps  or successfully sell proportionately more new products with higher asps 
yield or other production problems  or shortages of supply may preclude us from lowering or maintaining current operating costs 
also  competitive  market and other pressures may not allow us to increase our sales of our higher asp products 
in addition  we are entering into an ethernet market of the networking industry characterized by average volumes that are higher and gross margins that are lower than the market in which we currently participate 
to maintain our current operating margins  we will have to sell higher volumes of these chips than in our traditional markets 
if we sell these chips in low volumes  our operating margins may be adversely affected 
we need to successfully develop and introduce our new products the success of our new products depends on a number of factors  including o our definition of new products to meet customer requirements  o our completion of product development and introduction of new products to market in a timely manner  o our ability to judge product demand  o competitive pricing and performance levels  and o suitable fabrication yields by our independent foundries 
many of these factors are outside our control 
we may not be able to effectively accomplish those factors that are in our control 
some of our products adhere to specifications developed by industry groups 
for example  in the second half of  we introduced two packet over sonet devices based on specifications developed by an industry group 
these specifications may not reach sufficient acceptance by the market to allow our products commercial success 
in september  we entered into a new product area 
we acquired in process research and development and developed technology relating to ethernet switching 
it is possible that ethernet products may not be sufficiently accepted by the market to achieve commercial success 
in may  we acquired in process research and development and developed technology related to atm segmentation and reassembly as well at atm switching 
it is possible that these products may not achieve volumes sufficient to assure their commercial success 
we operate in an industry subject to rapid technological change we sell products to a market whose characteristics include rapidly evolving industry standards  product obsolescence  and new manufacturing and design technologies 
our complex semiconductors require extensive design and testing before prototypes can be manufactured 
they often need to be redesigned because manufacturing yields on prototypes are unacceptable or customers redefine their products to meet changing industry standards 
many of the standards and protocols for our products are based on high speed networking technologies that have not been widely adopted or ratified by one of the standard setting bodies in our customers industry 
our customers often delay or alter their design demands during this standard setting process 
in response  we must redesign our products to suit these changing demands 
redesign usually delays the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete due to these rapidly evolving industry standards and customer preferences 
we depend on the atm telecommunications and networking market we focus a significant part of our business and research expenditures in the asynchronous transfer mode atm telecommunications and networking market 
as a result of our restructuring  revenues from non networking products have declined significantly over the last several years  making our results depend primarily on atm and related products 
the percentage of net revenues to total company sales derived from sales of atm  t e  ds e and sonet sdh based products amounted to in compared to in the atm market is in an early stage of deployment 
if the industry adopts industry standards that compete with atm  our atm products could be made unmarketable or obsolete 
the market for atm equipment has not developed as rapidly as industry observers had originally predicted  while alternative networking technologies such as packet over sonet and gigabit ethernet have developed to meet networking requirements 
we face fierce competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change and price erosion 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in these markets depends on o our product performance  quality and pricing  o our  our competitors and our customers timing and success of new product introductions  o our ability to innovate  o our ability to deliver working products on schedule  o market acceptance of standards for which we have produced products  o our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity  o our subcontractors production efficiency  o the rate at which our customers incorporate our products into their designs  and o our and our competitors assertion of intellectual property rights 
we typically face competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
our competitors have increasingly frequent opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems because of shortened product life and design in cycles in many of our customers products 
our competitors are major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
emerging companies also provide significant competition in our segment of the semiconductor market 
our competitors include advanced micro circuits corporation  broadcom  conexant systems  cypress semiconductor  dallas semiconductor  galileo technology  integrated device technology  level one communications  lucent technologies  motorola  mmc networks  siemens  texas instruments  transwitch and vitesse semiconductor 
over the next few years  we expect additional competitors  some of which also may have greater financial and other resources  to enter the market with new products 
we must have access to wafer fabrication and other manufacturing capacity to succeed we do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
two outside foundries supply all our semiconductor device requirements 
our foundry suppliers also produce products for themselves and other companies 
we may not have access to adequate capacity or certain process technologies 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
if the foundries we use are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes  we may have to identify and qualify acceptable additional or alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we might not find enough capacity quickly enough  if ever  to satisfy our production requirements 
sub assemblers in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products 
raw material shortages  political and social instability  assembly house service disruptions  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays which  in turn  may result in the loss of customers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  assembly processes  quality assurances and costs than competitors that do not outsource these tasks 
our customer base is concentrated we depend on a limited number of customers for a major portion of our revenues 
through direct  distributor and subcontractor purchases  lucent technologies including ascend communications and cisco systems each accounted for more than of our fiscal revenues 
we do not have long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
our customers often shift buying patterns as they manage inventory levels  decide to use competing products  or change their orders for other reasons 
if one or more customers were to delay  reduce or cancel orders  our overall order levels may fluctuate greatly 
our global business approach subjects us to additional risks we are subject to a number of risks of conducting business outside of the united states 
historically  international sales accounted for the following percentages of our net revenues in  in and in we expect international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our  and our customers net revenues for the foreseeable future 
we are subject to these risks to a greater extent than most companies because  in addition to selling our products in a number of countries  a significant portion of our research and development and manufacturing are conducted outside of the united states 
the majority of our development  test  marketing and administrative functions occur in canada and substantially all of our products are manufactured and assembled by independent third parties in asia 
our international sales  research and development and manufacturing may subject us to the following risks o changes to  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements and policy changes affecting the networking market  o delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas  exchange rates and other trade barriers and restrictions  o foreign currency rate fluctuations because our development  test  marketing and administrative costs are denominated in canadian dollars  and our selling costs are denominated in a variety of currencies  o greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  o longer payment cycles  o taxes  o political  social and economic instability  o hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and o the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and communications standards 
we depend on key personnel we must retain and hire key technical personnel to be successful 
this is particularly true with respect to those employees who are highly skilled at the design and test functions used to develop high speed networking products and related software 
the competition for such employees is intense and we do not have employment agreements in place with these key personnel 
we issue common stock options that are subject to vesting as employee incentives 
these options  however  are effective as retention incentives only if they have economic value 
our products employ proprietary technology that we may not be able to protect to compete effectively  we must protect our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we hold several patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
we might not succeed in attaining patents from any of our pending applications 
even if we are awarded patents  they may not provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  as they may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or may not be issued in all countries where our products can be sold 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
we develop  manufacture and sell our products in asian and other countries that may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this makes piracy of our technology and products more likely 
steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent theft of our technology 
we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are similar to or better than ours 
our products employ proprietary technology that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions characterize the semiconductor industry 
this often results in expensive and lengthy litigation 
we  as well as our customers or suppliers  may be accused of infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
this has happened in the past 
an adverse result in any litigation could force us to pay substantial damages  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue using certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology  nor might we be able to find appropriate licenses on reasonable terms 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry are often settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we currently do not have a substantial portfolio of patents  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we are therefore more exposed to third party claims than some of our competitors and customers 
in the past  our customers have been required to obtain licenses from and pay royalties to third parties for the sale of systems incorporating our semiconductor devices 
until december of  we indemnified our customers up to the dollar amount of their purchases of our products found to be infringing on technology owned by third parties 
customers may also make claims against us with respect to infringement 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringing our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this could consume significant resources and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the litigation s outcome 
we may be involved in acquisitions we may acquire products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
management may be diverted from our operations while they identify and negotiate these acquisitions and integrate an acquired entity into our operations 
also  we may be forced to develop expertise outside our existing businesses  and replace key personnel who leave due to an acquisition 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  or issue additional equity 
if we issue more equity  we may dilute our common stock with securities that have a senior interest 
acquired entities also may have unknown liabilities  and the combined entity may not achieve the results that were anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
an acquisition that is accounted for as a purchase could involve significant one time write offs  and could involve the amortization of goodwill over a number of years 
this was the accounting method used to record our acquisition of a networking business in  certain assets of bipolar integrated technology in september  and the acquisition of integrated telecom technology in may we may need additional capital in the future we must continue to make significant investments in research and development  capital equipment and facilities for our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including product development  working capital investments  and acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have priority rights to your investment 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms we or you will find favorable 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated substantially 
the reasons this may continue include the following o our or our competitors new product announcements  o quarterly fluctuations in the financial results of our company and other companies in the semiconductor  networking or computer industries  o conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry  and o investor sentiment toward technology stocks 
in addition  increases in our stock price and expansion of our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction 
year computer systems issues the approach of the year presents significant issues for many financial  information  and operational systems 
many systems in use today may not be able to interpret dates after december  appropriately  because such systems allow only two digits to indicate the year in a date 
as a result  such systems are unable to distinguish january   from january   which could have adverse consequences on the operations of the entity 
our state of readiness we have designated specific individuals to identify and resolve year issues associated with our internal information technology it systems  our internal non it systems  and material third party relationships 
we have completed the identification of and are implementing our plans to address our year issues 
we use commercially available standard software for our critical operating and design functions 
our primary software vendors have provided program updates that are intended to rectify the year issues related to their software 
we upgraded all primary software by the second quarter of in addition  we are currently implementing an enterprise wide software system for operational reasons 
this system is scheduled to be fully implemented in and is year compliant 
we have secondary design and operating software that is not year compliant 
we have identified and intend to install or develop patches or workaround solutions for this software during we use other technology  such as semiconductor testers  which are not year compliant 
these systems do not interface with our critical operating applications 
we have identified these systems and expect to conclude modifying or replacing them in the total cost of the software upgrade for our primary operating and financial applications  the cost to purchase and install our other non critical software  and the cost for the modification and replacement of our other technology is not expected to be material 
our year risk our greatest year exposure comes from our product manufacturing  packaging and delivery suppliers 
our worst case scenario would be if one or more critical suppliers fail to become year compliant and fail to develop acceptable workaround solutions 
the majority of our product manufacturing  packaging and delivery is outsourced to two wafer fabrication companies  three assembly companies and one shipping company  respectively 
these suppliers are generally much larger than our company and we have little influence on their year preparedness schedules 
while we have received written communication from our critical suppliers that they have developed an action plan to address their year issues  we cannot be certain that these plans will be implemented or be effective 
if our suppliers are unable to manufacture our products as a result of year issues  we may be forced to find and qualify other year compliant suppliers 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we may not find sufficient capacity quickly enough to satisfy our production requirements  as we would expect that the many other companies with manufacturing models similar to ours would be vying for production capacity 
we are also exposed to customers who may not be year compliant 
if one or more of our customers operations is interrupted due to year issue non compliance  our revenues from these customers could be materially impacted 
our contingency plans while we do not have a formal contingency plan  we are monitoring our critical suppliers to ensure they complete their year plans as scheduled 
we would implement a formal contingency plan should any of our critical suppliers indicate that there would be any delays resulting from their own year plans 
such a plan could entail contacting and qualifying other potentially year compliant suppliers and stocking additional inventory to cover short term operating needs 
we can not ensure that this contingency plan would be effective or completed in a timely manner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through our operations in canada and elsewhere 
in our effort to hedge this risk  we typically forecast our operational currency needs  purchase such currency on the open market at the beginning of an operational period  and classify these funds as a hedge against operations 
we usually limit the operational period to less than months to avoid undue exposure of our asset position to further foreign currency fluctuation 
while we expect to utilize this method of hedging our foreign currency risk in the future  we may change our hedging methodology and utilize foreign exchange contracts which are currently available under our operating line of credit agreement 
occasionally  we may not be able to correctly forecast our operational needs 
if our forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at the end of our fiscal years and  we did not have significant foreign currency denominated net asset or net liability positions  and we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturity dates with various banks and investment banking institutions 
we regularly hold investments beyond days  and the market value of these investments on any day during the investment term may vary as a result of market interest rate fluctuations 
we do not hedge this exposure because short term fluctuations in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on interest earnings 
we classify our investments as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase and re evaluate this designation as of each balance sheet date 
at the end of and  all outstanding short term investments were classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
these investments were held until maturity in the first quarter of and  respectively 
in the future  we expect to continue holding our short term investments to maturity
