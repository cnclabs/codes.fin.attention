liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations primarily through funds provided from operations and through borrowings under its revolving credit facility

this source of funds resulted from improved profitability  along with higher income taxes payable and accounts payable balances  partially offset by increased inventory and accounts receivable levels

for the year ended december   the company provided approximately million in cash from operating activities  primarily as a result of increases in profitability giving effect to the inventory step up amortization  a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in income taxes payable and accrued liabilities offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
since december   the company has additional borrowings of million  which were used to fund capital expenditures  recent acquisitions and a portion of the share repurchase program 
for the years ended december   and  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of these capital expenditures were for facility and equipment improvement  information technology enhancements and site consolidations 
the company anticipates additional capital expenditures of approximately million to be made throughout to expand production capacity  further consolidate locations  and improve management information systems 
the company expects to fund these capital expenditures primarily by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
as a result of the barnes hind acquisition  the company expects to incur integration costs of approximately million  principally for severance costs and lease expenses on vacated premises 
management expects that this restructuring will be substantially completed by march  as of december   the company has paid million of these integration costs 
effective july   the company entered into the first amendment and consent of the amended bank credit agreement to increase the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility to million and to permit the repurchase of a maximum of million of the company s common stock 
see share repurchase program 
as of december   the company had approximately million in borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility portion of the amended bank credit agreement 
the amended bank credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on the company  including restrictions on its ability to incur indebtedness  declare dividends or other distributions  make investments and capital expenditures  grant liens  sell its assets and engage in certain other activities 
in addition  the indebtedness of the company under the amended bank credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company  including the company s real and personal property  inventory  accounts receivable  intellectual property and other tangible assets 
management believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated internal growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including borrowings under the amended bank credit agreement and cash on hand at december   of million  will be adequate over the next twelve months to make required payments of principal and interest on the company s indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements  including the aforementioned restructuring and integration costs  and to enable the company and its subsidiaries to comply with the terms of their debt agreements 
however  actual capital requirements may change  particularly as a result of any acquisitions the company may pursue 
the ability of the company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the company and its subsidiaries which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the company s control 
a significant portion of the consolidated debt of the company bears interest at floating rates  therefore  the company s financial condition is and will continue to be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
in december   the company purchased an interest rate cap on million notional principal amount at a fixed rate of  which expires on december  the cap is intended to provide partial protection from potential exposure relating to the company s variable rate debt instruments 
approximately of the company s net sales for the year ended december  were to international customers and the company expects that sales to international customers will continue to represent a material portion of its net sales 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had only a minor impact on the company s results of operations and the company does not expect such fluctuations to be material in the foreseeable future 
share repurchase program the board of directors approved a share repurchase plan on june  and the company completed the program on september  under the plan  the company repurchased one million shares of its outstanding common stock at an average cost of per share 
repurchases were made in normal market trading at prevailing prices and were funded from operating cash flow and the existing bank facility 
recent acquisitions on june   the company acquired the operations of plastic contact lens argentina saic pcl from its sole shareholder 
on july   the company  through its australian subsidiary  executed a purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of eycon lens laboratories  pty  ltd 
from its shareholders 
the total adjusted purchase price for both acquisitions of approximately million plus additional fees and expenses of million was funded with existing liquidity 
the company has accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results of operations for the company during the three years ended december  recently issued accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities issued in june   establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
amending sfas  foreign currency translation and sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments and superceding sfas  accounting for futures contracts  sfas  disclosure of information about financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk and sfas  disclosure about derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments  sfas requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and does not permit retroactive application to prior period financial statements 
the company expects to adopt this statement in its financial statements for the year ending december  this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
year the company utilizes and relies upon computer technology in many facets of its operations  such as in the manufacture of contact lenses  the distribution of lenses to customers  the arrangement of credit in connection with the purchase of goods and the internal and external reporting of financial and operational information 
the technologies employed by the company throughout its operation include hardware and software as well as microprocessors and other electronic devices which are components of production equipment embedded chips 
in the past  certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
consequently  any of the company s systems and equipment that involve the use of time sensitive software programmed in that manner may recognize a date identified as as the year rather than  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
this is commonly referred to as the year or yk issue 
the company has undertaken a global approach to addressing the year issue 
thus far  the company has identified the areas of its operations in which the year issue may arise and conducted a global survey of all personal computer  software and other essential equipment to identify components that must be modified or replaced 
a formal plan has been established to acquire new and repair existing company personal computers and associated software by june  an assessment of manufacturing equipment and software has been completed 
mainframe system software modifications are progressing according to plan and  in instances where critical  are being tested 
in addition  the company has initiated written communications with significant suppliers and all banking institutions with which the company has financial arrangements to determine the extent to which the company s systems and operations are vulnerable to those third parties failures to remediate their year compliance problems 
the company s global steering committee meets bi weekly to monitor the progress of testing all company information technology it and relevant non it systems  to establish milestones for completion of specific year related tasks throughout the company s facilities  and to supervise generally the measures taken by the company to address the year issue 
the company presently believes that  as a result of its actions  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
if  however  the modifications  conversions and testing described above are not accomplished in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties will be made compliant in a timely manner and would not have an adverse effect on the company 
the company is using both internal and external resources to identify and test systems for year compliance and to modify or replace them where necessary 
to assure year compliance  the company has made commitments of million to date  of which million has been spent in  and has projected commitments of million in future periods 
the majority of these costs will be expensed as incurred  with the remainder treated as capital expenditures 
costs related to year compliance were not significant in prior years 
at this time  management is unable to estimate the effect of noncompliance with the year issue on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition beyond the belief that noncompliance would be material in nature 
to mitigate the potential risk related to unsuccessful remediation on either the part of the company or its significant suppliers or bankers  a contingency plan is being developed and is scheduled for completion by june  conversion to euro currency on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the conversion to the euro will eliminate currency exchange risk between member countries 
beginning in january   new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro will be between january  and june  the company conducts business in some member countries affected 
the more important issues facing the company include converting information technology systems  negotiating and amending business agreements and contracts  processing tax and accounting records  and potentially the competitive impact of cross border price transparency 
the company s operating subsidiaries affected by the euro currency conversion are addressing the issues involved  currently with preliminary emphasis on order processing  banking and assessment of financial systems 
due to the uncertainties involved  the issue of one common currency s effect on pricing and its impact on results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
based on our work to date  we believe the euro currency conversion will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
such forward looking statements are based on the beliefs of the company s management as well as on assumptions made by and information currently available to the company at the time such statements were made 
when used in this md a  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intends  and similar expressions  as they relate to the company are intended to identify forward looking statements  which include statements relating to  among other things  i the ability of the company to continue to compete successfully in the contact lens market  ii the anticipated benefits from new product introductions  iii the completion of the integration of barnes hind with the company  iv the strategic benefits of the barnes hind acquisition  v the continued effectiveness of the company s sales and marketing strategy  vi the ability of the company to continue to successfully develop and launch new products  vii the timely resolution of the year issue by the company and its suppliers  and viii the euro conversion 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the matters discussed herein and certain economic and business factors  some of which may be beyond the control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is primarily exposed to market risks that relate to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company attempts to manage these risks to an acceptable level based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
selectively  the company enters into interest rate caps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage market risks 
the company does not hold financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses forward exchange contracts to minimize the effects of foreign currency fluctuations between the british pound sterling and the japanese yen 
these contracts are used to hedge certain intercompany amounts owed  and the notional amounts and fair values of those contracts were not material at december  interest rate risk virtually all of the company s debt bears interest at floating rates  approximately at december  therefore  increases and decreases in interest rates have significant impact on the company s overall profitability  but do not have a significant impact on the fair value of the debt overall 
a increase in the interest rate would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  or  the company purchased an interest rate cap of on million of notional principal amount in order to partially offset adverse impacts of potential interest rate increases 
the company currently does not expect to incur any expense or receive any significant benefit from the interest rate cap because of the large difference between the current interest rate and the interest rate cap
