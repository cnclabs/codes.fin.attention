see the description of forward looking statements found in forward looking statements 
effect of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on earnings during the past several years 
inflationary increases in the cost of labor  food and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s restaurant operating margins 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operations and increase menu prices to offset increases in its operating costs 
federal law increased the hourly minimum wage to on september  the legislation  however  froze the wages of tipped employees at per hour if the difference is earned in tip income 
although the company experienced a slight increase in hourly labor costs during and  the effect of the increase in minimum wage was significantly diluted due to the fact that the majority of the company s hourly employees are tipped and the company s non tipped employees have historically earned wages greater than the federal minimum 
as such  the company s increases in hourly labor cost were not proportionate to the increases in minimum wage rates 
impact of the year issue most hardware and software designed in the past was not designed to recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the failure of such hardware and software to properly recognize the dates beginning in the year could result in miscalculations or system failures  which could result in an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company s key information technology systems  including its financial  informational and operational systems it systems  which are mainly comprised of third party hardware and software  have been assessed and detailed plans have been developed to address any remediations required before the end of the company is in the process of testing its it systems to determine year compliance 
management anticipates that such testing will be complete by september  in addition  the company is in the process of assessing its non it systems that utilize embedded technology such as microcontrollers and reviewing them for year compliance 
assessment of the company s non it systems is scheduled for completion by september  to operate its business  the company relies upon its suppliers  distributors and other third party service providers material providers  over which it can assert little control 
the company s ability to conduct its core business is dependent upon the ability of these material providers to remediate their year issues to the extent they affect the company 
if the material providers do not appropriately remediate their year issues or develop viable contingency plans  the company s ability to conduct its core business may be materially impacted  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
where predictable  the company is assessing and attempting to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of its material providers to be year ready as part of its ongoing contingency planning 
the company has requested all of its material providers to provide information regarding their state of year readiness 
the process of following up with material providers who have not yet responded and evaluating all responses is expected to be completed by september  although the communications received by the company from its material providers  to date  have not disclosed any material year issues  there is no assurance that these material providers will be year ready on a timely basis 
unanticipated failures or significant delays in furnishing products or services by material providers could cause certain restaurants to temporarily close or remove certain items from their menus  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if unanticipated problems arise from systems or equipment  there could be material adverse effects on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as part of the year readiness efforts  the company is developing contingency plans which will need to be implemented in the event of failures in the company s it systems or non it systems 
the remainder of the contingency plans are expected to be completed by september   but will be modified as additional information regarding possible failures becomes available 
the company expenses costs associated with its year system changes as the costs are incurred except for system change costs that the company would otherwise capitalize 
the program  including testing and remediation of all of the company s systems and applications  the cost of external consultants  the purchase of software and hardware  the development and implementation of viable contingency plans  including the compensation of internal employees working on year projects  is expected to cost approximately  except for fringe benefits of internal employees  which are not separately tracked from inception in calendar year through completion in calendar year of these costs  approximately  was incurred approximately  of which was capitalized during and approximately  is expected to be incurred in approximately  of which will be capitalized 
however  the company is unable to estimate the additional costs that it may incur subsequent to as a result of year problems suffered by material providers  and there can be no assurance that the company will successfully address the year problems present in its own it systems and non it systems

in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop identifies the characteristics of internal use software and specifies that once the preliminary project stage is complete  certain external direct costs  certain direct internal payroll and payroll related costs and interest costs incurred during the development of computer software for internal use should be capitalized and amortized 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier application encouraged  and must be applied to internal use computer software costs incurred in those fiscal years for all projects  including those projects in progress upon initial application of this sop 
the company currently expenses all such costs as incurred 
management has not yet quantified the dollar impact of adopting sop  however  when implemented in  it will result in the capitalization of costs which would have been previously expensed 
as is currently the practice of many casual dining and upscale restaurant entities  through the end of  the company deferred its restaurant pre opening costs and amortized them over the twelve month period following the opening of each respective restaurant 
the company also deferred organization costs and amortizes them over a five year period through the end of statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities was issued in april sop requires entities to expense as incurred all start up and pre opening costs that are not otherwise capitalized as long lived assets 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier adoption is encouraged 
restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted by sop  and entities are not required to report the pro forma effects of the retroactive application of the new accounting standard 
the company s adoption of the expense as incurred accounting principle required by sop will involve the recognition of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle required by sop as a one time charge against earnings  net of any related income tax effect  retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
the company will adopt sop in the first quarter of the adoption of this change in accounting method is expected to result in a one time charge of million  less applicable income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   million was outstanding under the company s million revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding under such credit facility bear interest at libor plus a margin of to depending on the company s leverage ratio  or the administrative agent s prime rate of interest plus a margin of to depending on the company s leverage ratio at the company s option 
accordingly  the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate movements 
to achieve the company s objective of managing its exposure to interest rate changes  the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps 
in august  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank  which effectively fixes the interest rate at on million of the company s borrowings through august  decreasing to million through february and decreasing to million through august the company is exposed to credit losses on this interest rate swap in the event of counterparty non performance  but does not anticipate any such losses 
while changes in libor and the administrative agent s prime rate of interest could affect the cost of borrowings under the credit facility in excess of amounts covered by the interest rate swap agreement of which only million was outstanding at december  in the future  the company does not consider its current exposure to changes in such rates to be material  and the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows would not be material 
investment portfolio the company invests portions of its excess cash  if any  in highly liquid investments 
at december   the company had approximately million invested in high grade overnight repurchase agreements
