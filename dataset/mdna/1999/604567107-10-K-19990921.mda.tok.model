overview our predecessor  mips computer systems  inc  was founded in and was engaged in the design and development of risc processors for the computer systems and embedded markets 
silicon graphics adopted the mips architecture for its computer systems in and acquired mips computer systems  inc in following the acquisition  silicon graphics continued the mips processor business through its mips group a division of silicon graphics  which focused primarily on the development of high performance processors for silicon graphics workstations and servers 
until the last few years  cost considerations limited the use of mips risc processors in high volume digital consumer products 
as the cost to manufacture processors based on the mips technology decreased  the mips group sought to penetrate the consumer market  both through supporting and coordinating the efforts of the mips semiconductor licensees and  most notably  by partnering with nintendo in its design of the nintendo video game player and related cartridges 
in order to increase the focus of the mips group on the design and development of processor intellectual property for the embedded market  effective june   silicon graphics separated the business of the mips group from its other operations and transferred to us the assets  liabilities and intellectual property related to this business 
revenue related to sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges currently accounts for the substantial majority of our revenue 
in the short term  we intend to use our operating cash flow  including royalties we receive with respect to sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges  to fund processor and related design efforts aimed at the digital consumer products market and to establish and strengthen relationships with semiconductor licensees and system original equipment manufacturers system oems 
as part of these efforts  we intend to develop processors with increased flexibility and modularity that will allow our semiconductor licensees  as well as system oems  to provide high performance  customized products more quickly 
the financial statements for periods prior to the third quarter of fiscal reflect the historical results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the mips group  certain portions of which were transferred to us by silicon graphics in connection with the separation of the two businesses 
the financial statements for such periods have been carved out from the financial statements of silicon graphics using the historical results of operations and historical basis of the assets and liabilities of our business  as adjusted to reflect allocations of certain corporate charges that our management believes are reasonable 
our financial information for periods prior to the third quarter of fiscal may not necessarily reflect the results of our operations  financial position and cash flows in the future or what the results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had the mips group been a separate  stand alone entity during those periods 
the financial information for such earlier periods does not reflect the many significant changes that have occurred in our funding and operations and the sources and costs of revenue as a result of both our separation from silicon graphics and our shift in strategic direction 
our revenue consists of royalties and contract revenue earned under contracts with our licensees and under our agreement with nintendo 
our contracts with our licensees are typically subject to periodic renewal or extension and expire at various dates through december we generate royalties from the sale by semiconductor manufacturers of products incorporating our technology 
royalty revenue generally is recognized in the quarter in which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of products incorporating our intellectual property ie  generally in the quarter following the sale of the licensee s product to its customer 
royalties may be calculated as a percentage of the revenue received by the seller on sales of such products or on a per unit basis 
under the terms of an agreement with silicon graphics entered into in connection with the separation  we also receive all royalties payable by nintendo relating to sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
contract revenue includes technology license fees and engineering services fees 
we receive license fees for the use of technology that we have developed internally and  in some cases  which we have licensed from third parties 
license fees are typically recognized upon the execution of the license agreement and transfer of intellectual property  provided no further significant performance obligations exist 
technology license fees vary based on  among other things  whether a particular technology is licensed for a single application or for multiple or unlimited applications  and whether the license granted covers a particular design or a broader architecture 
part of these fees may be payable up front and part may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones such as provision of deliverables by us or production of semiconductor chips by the licensee 
engineering services fees are recognized as revenue when defined milestones are completed and the milestone payment is probable of collection 
in most instances  the technology we develop  including under engineering services contracts  can be licensed to multiple customers 
in fiscal  and  our revenue consisted primarily of royalties which exceeded of our total revenue during those periods  due primarily to royalties earned from nintendo  and to a lesser extent nec  on sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
royalties from nintendo and nec on sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal and of our total revenue for fiscal we anticipate that revenue related to sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue for the next few years 
we receive royalties from nec based on a percentage of the revenue derived by nec from sales of the processor included in the nintendo video game player 
current royalties from nintendo are based on unit sales of nintendo video game cartridges 
we also received royalties from nintendo with respect to the graphics chip included in nintendo video game players  and these royalties had a lifetime cap based on unit sales that was reached in the second quarter of fiscal there is no cap on royalties from nec with respect to its sale of processors to nintendo for nintendo video game players or on royalties from nintendo with respect to sales of nintendo video game cartridges 
the market for home entertainment products is competitive and the introduction of new products or technologies  as well as shifting consumer preferences  could negatively impact the amount and timing of sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
in addition  the eventual introduction of the next generation nintendo video game system is likely to result in declining sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges  although sales of video game cartridges  which account for a significant portion of our royalties  will continue  albeit at a declining rate  for a period of time after the introduction 
we developed key elements of the nintendo system in conjunction with silicon graphics 
these elements included certain software and graphics technologies which  as a result of our separation from silicon graphics and our shift in strategic direction in early  we no longer offer 
accordingly  we will need to generate revenue growth from our stated markets to offset the eventual decline of nintendo royalties 
we understand that the next generation nintendo video game system will not incorporate any of our technology 
we value our relationship with nintendo  however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will result in any revenues for us other than those generated by the sale of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
we expect that royalties will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenue over the next few years due to our contractual arrangements with nintendo 
the amount  timing and relative mix of royalties and contract revenue is difficult to predict 
factors affecting the amount and timing of our future royalties include the adoption of our technology by digital consumer product and business equipment manufacturers  consumer acceptance of products incorporating our technology  changes in the average selling prices of semiconductor and digital consumer products and business equipment  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
moreover  our royalty arrangements will vary from licensee to licensee depending on a number of factors  including the amount of any license fee paid and the marketing and engineering support required by the licensee 
contract revenue may fluctuate significantly from period to period and any increase or decrease in such revenue will not be indicative of future period to period increases or decreases 
factors affecting the amount and timing of our future contract revenue include the financial terms of our contractual arrangements with our semiconductor licensees  which may provide for significant up front payments or payments based on the achievement of certain milestones  and the adoption of our technology by semiconductor manufacturers  which is influenced by a number of factors including competitive conditions in the market for processor and core intellectual property 
although a substantial portion of our total revenue to date has been derived from royalties and contract revenue relating to sales of nintendo video game products  we expect that royalties and contract revenue related to sales of other digital consumer products  such as handheld personal computers  cellular telephones and set top boxes  as well as other video game products  will constitute an increasingly significant portion of our total revenue 
our ability to diversify our revenue base will depend primarily on the number and variety of design wins we obtain from digital consumer product and business equipment manufacturers  and consumer acceptance of products that incorporate our technology 
we generally do not have a direct contractual relationship with digital consumer product manufacturers  and the royalty reports submitted by our semiconductor licensees generally do not disclose which consumer products include our risc technology 
as a result  it is difficult for us to identify or predict the extent to which our future revenue will be dependent upon a particular digital consumer product or product manufacturer 
because revenue related to sales of digital consumer products is expected to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue over the next several years  we expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results 
we typically record royalty revenue from our licensees  including nintendo  in the quarter following the sale of the related digital consumer product 
because a disproportionate amount of nintendo video game cartridges are typically sold in the second fiscal quarter which includes the holiday selling season  we have realized a disproportionate amount of our revenue and operating income in our third fiscal quarter 
as we increase our focus on processors  cores and related designs for high volume digital consumer products  similar seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results can be expected to continue 
a significant portion of our total revenue has been and is expected to continue to be derived from a limited number of semiconductor companies 
revenue from our top two semiconductor company licensees represented an aggregate of of our total revenue in both fiscal and fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal although we continue to broaden our base of licensees  it is likely that our revenue will continue to be concentrated at the semiconductor licensee level 
this revenue concentration for any given period will vary depending on the addition or expiration of contracts  the nature and timing of payments due under such contracts and the volumes and prices at which our licensees sell products incorporating our technology 
accordingly  the identity of particular licensees that will account for any such revenue concentration will vary from period to period and may be difficult to predict 
the non renewal of contracts by our semiconductor company licensees could adversely affect our future operating results 
to date  companies based in japan have accounted for the substantial majority of our total revenue  and nearly all of our international revenue 
international revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue in both fiscal and fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal substantially all of this revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
we expect that revenue derived from international licensees  primarily in asia  will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses include cost of contract revenue  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue presently consists primarily of sublicense fees 
we incur an obligation to pay these fees when we sublicense to our customers technology that we have licensed from third parties 
sublicense fees are recognized as cost of contract revenue when the obligation is incurred  which is typically the same period in which the related revenue is recognized 
prior to fiscal  cost of contract revenue also included nonrecurring engineering service costs directly related to a development agreement with a specific licensee  which were expensed as incurred over the period of services 
we believe that future cost of contract revenue will be minimal 
research and development the separation of our business from that of silicon graphics and our shift in strategic direction has significantly impacted our research and development cost structure 
the markets we presently target allow us to use relatively small design teams and to rely largely on industry standard third party design tools 
by contrast  silicon graphics complex processor requirements and its need to develop and maintain proprietary design tools demanded that the mips group employ large design teams 
as a result  we have been able to reduce our staffing requirements and costs 
at december   our research and development staff totaled persons 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we reduced our research and development staff by persons  reflecting the transfer to silicon graphics of employees engaged in the development of next generation processors for silicon graphics systems as well as other staff reductions associated with the separation and shift in strategic direction 
at june   our research and development staff totaled persons  compared to persons at june  this increase reflects in part the addition of employees to staff our research and development activities in a new development center in copenhagen  denmark that began operations in december these employees are engaged in product development and also provide support and design expertise for our european based customers 
we expect that our research and development staff and expenses will increase as we continue to develop new designs for the digital consumer products and business equipment markets 
the costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expense as they are incurred and are not directly related to any particular licensee  license agreement or license fee 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include salaries  travel expenses and costs associated with direct marketing  advertising and other marketing efforts 
costs of technical support are also included in sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing efforts are directed at establishing and supporting licensing relationships with semiconductor manufacturers  fabless semiconductor companies and system oems 
at june   our sales and marketing staff totaled persons 
our sales and marketing staff and related expenses are expected to increase as we seek to diversify our revenue base 
general and administrative historically  a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses have reflected an allocation of corporate overhead by silicon graphics based on headcount and a percentage allocation based on certain factors including net sales  headcount and relative expenditure levels 
presently  certain facilities services are provided to us pursuant to an agreement with silicon graphics 
our general and administrative expenses have grown substantially since the separation due  in part  to costs related to our status as a stand alone entity such as increased legal and patent related costs and expenses related to compliance with the reporting and other requirements of a publicly traded company 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will remain relatively stable in the near future 
results of operation years ended june   and our total revenue in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year total revenue million million million total revenue consisted of royalty revenue and contract revenue 
total revenue increased by million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in contract revenue as we entered into technology licensing agreements with both new and existing licensees 
royalties for fiscal  and consisted of royalties from sale by semiconductor manufacturers of products incorporating our technology and from sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
the significant increase in royalties in fiscal from fiscal reflects royalties received from nintendo and nec related to sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
we earned our first significant royalties from nintendo video game system sales in the third quarter of fiscal  following the commercial introduction of that system 
in the second quarter of fiscal  royalties from the graphics chip included in the nintendo game player reached its cap 
contract revenue for fiscal consists of fees generated from new license agreements entered into during fiscal and included engineering service fees earned upon our achievement of defined milestones 
contract revenue for fiscal consisted principally of license fees related to code compression technology and for fiscal consisted principally of engineering service fees from nintendo related to development efforts for nintendo video game products 
our costs of contract revenue in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year cost of contract revenue million cost of contract revenue in fiscal and was principally attributable to sublicense fees and in fiscal was principally attributable to non recurring engineering fees related to nintendo video game system development 
we believe that future cost of contract revenue will be minimal 
research and development expenses in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year research and development expenses million million million the million decrease in fiscal from fiscal reflects the separation of our business from that of silicon graphics as well as the change in our strategic direction in the second half of fiscal research and development expenses for the first half of fiscal and for all of fiscal reflect the operations of the mips group  a division of silicon graphics  which had a staff of persons at december  because the markets we have targeted allow us to use relatively small design teams and to rely largely on industry standard third party design tools  we reduced our research and development staff by approximately persons in connection with the separation during the second half of fiscal sales and marketing expenses in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year sales and marketing expenses million million million the increase in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in our licensing and marketing activities 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in advertising and promotional spending 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal  and were as follows fiscal year general and administrative expenses million million million the increase in fiscal over both fiscal and reflects the existence of legal and administrative costs related to our status as a publicly traded company that we did not incur prior to our separation from silicon graphics 
the restructuring charge taken in the second quarter of fiscal included  in severance related costs and million in asset write downs related to our shift in strategic direction 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to interest expense of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the interest income was earned from the investment of the net cash proceeds of approximately million from our july initial public offering and the cash generated from our operating activities during fiscal on may   the effective date of a secondary offering of our common stock by silicon graphics  silicon graphics ownership interest in us was reduced to approximately 
because silicon graphics now owns less than of our outstanding class a and class b common stock  we will no longer be included in silicon graphics consolidated federal income tax group  but will instead be required to file separate tax returns 
while we were a part of silicon graphics consolidated group for federal income tax purposes  we were responsible for our income taxes through a tax sharing agreement with silicon graphics 
to the extent we produced taxable income  losses or credits  we made or received payments as though we filed separate federal  state and local income tax returns 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal based on an estimated federal and state combined rate of on income before taxes 
because our tax sharing agreement provides that we do not receive any benefit for losses incurred or have any tax liability for any income earned up to the closing of our initial public offering in july  no income tax provision or benefit was reflected in fiscal and impact of currency certain of our international licensees pay royalties based on revenues that are reported in a local currency currently yen and translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect when such revenues are reported by the licensee 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that sales to digital consumer product manufacturers by our manufacturing licensees are denominated in foreign currencies  royalties we receive on such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of the technology we sell to our licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  demand for technology could fall which would  in turn  reduce our royalties 
we are unable to predict the amount of non us dollar denominated revenue earned by our licensees and  therefore  have not attempted to mitigate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our royalty revenue 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements are to fund working capital needs  and to a lesser extent capital expenditures  in order to support our revenue growth 
prior to our initial public offering in july  our capital requirements were satisfied by funds provided by silicon graphics through its cash management system 
since the initial public offering  we have not participated in silicon graphics cash management system and silicon graphics has not provided additional funds to finance our operations 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
for the fiscal year ended june   our operating activities provided net cash of million  primarily reflecting net income and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  as well as depreciation and other non cash charges  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was the result of accrued income taxes and an increase in accrued compensation related to higher staffing levels  as well as accumulated performance bonuses and increased accrued administrative costs associated with being a public company 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to amounts owed to us under new license agreements entered into during the period 
for the fiscal year ended june   our operating activities provided net cash of million  primarily reflecting approximately million of non cash depreciation and restructuring charges offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million 
for the fiscal year ended june   our operating activities used net cash of million  primarily reflecting net loss as well as an increase in other assets and liabilities  offset in part by depreciation and other non cash charges 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively net cash used in investing activities in all periods presented consisted of equipment purchases and licensing of computer aided design tools used in development 
capital expenditures have been  and future expenditures are anticipated to be  primarily for facilities and equipment to support expansion of our operations and licensing of computer aided design tools used in development 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase as our employee base grows 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal and net cash provided by financing activities of million for the fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal consisted primarily of net cash proceeds to us of approximately million from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering 
financing activities for fiscal year consisted primarily of net funds returned to silicon graphics  and payment of capital lease obligations 
financing activities for fiscal year consisted primarily of net funds provided by silicon graphics  and payment of capital lease obligations 
our future liquidity and capital requirements are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including  among others the cost  timing and success of product development efforts  the cost and timing of sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new technologies gain market acceptance  the level and timing of contract revenues and royalties  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that cash generated by our operations  together with our existing cash balance  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
moreover  strategic relationships  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require that we relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in the event that silicon graphics distributes the shares of our common stock that it owns in a transaction intended to be tax free to silicon graphics and its stockholders  our ability to issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions or to raise equity capital during the month period following such distribution will be limited under the terms of a distribution tax indemnification agreement which we have entered into with silicon graphics 
year compliance many computer programs and embedded date reliant systems use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs and systems that record only the last two digits of the calendar year may not be able to distinguish whether means or if not corrected  date related information and data could cause such programs or systems to fail or to generate erroneous information 
although our processor and related designs have no inherent time or date function  we initiated a comprehensive assessment of our year readiness in september we have recently completed this assessment and have begun to implement programs to make our information technology it and related non it and processes year compliant 
in addition  we recently replaced our internal computer systems and operating and applications software 
each of the suppliers of these systems and software has indicated to us that it believes its products are year compliant 
we expect to complete changes to critical systems by the third quarter of calendar year we believe that we have allocated sufficient resources for our year compliance efforts  and we expect that our expenses in these efforts will be less than  exclusive of ordinary costs to upgrade and maintain our equipment 
we intend to cooperate with our licensees and others with whom we do business to coordinate year compliance with operational processes and marketed products 
however  we are unable to directly assess the year compliance of products and technologies developed by others and incorporating our technology 
to the extent that any such third party product or technology is not year compliant  we may be adversely affected due to our association with such product or technology 
in addition  our revenue and operating results could become subject to unexpected fluctuations and could be adversely effected if our licensees or system oems encounter year compliance problems that affect their ability to distribute products that incorporate our technology 
we have been contacting critical suppliers to determine whether the products and services they provide are year compliant 
we will develop contingency plans should the need arise 
a delay or failure by critical suppliers to be year compliant could  in a worst case  interrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
year information and readiness disclosure act 
the year disclosure set forth above is intended to be a year statement as such term is defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act of the year act and  to the extent such disclosure relates to our year processing or to products or services offered by us  is also intended to be a year readiness disclosure as such term is defined in the year act 
factors that may affect our business factors negatively affecting sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges could materially and adversely affect us 
contract revenue and royalties from nintendo and nec relating to nintendo video game players and related cartridges accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we anticipate that royalties related to sales of nintendo video game cartridges will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue for the next few years 
accordingly  factors negatively affecting sales of nintendo video game cartridges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the market for home entertainment products is competitive and the introduction of new products or technologies  as well as shifting consumer preferences  could negatively impact the amount and timing of sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
we expect that revenue we derive from the sale of nintendo video game products will decline with the eventual introduction of the next generation nintendo video game system 
the eventual introduction of the next generation nintendo video game system is likely to result in declining sales of nintendo video game players and related cartridges  although sales of video game cartridges  which account for a significant portion of our royalties  will continue  albeit at a declining rate  for a period of time after the introduction 
we developed key elements of the nintendo system in conjunction with silicon graphics 
these elements included certain software and graphics technologies which  as a result of our separation from silicon graphics and our shift in strategic direction in early  we no longer offer 
we understand that the next generation nintendo video game system will not incorporate any of our technology 
we value our relationship with nintendo  however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will result in any revenues for us other than those generated by the sale of nintendo video game players and related cartridges 
we must diversify our sources of revenue to offset the eventual decline in revenue we derive from sales of nintendo video game products 
our ability to diversify our sources of revenue is still uncertain and will depend on whether our processors and related designs are selected for design design wins into a broader range of digital consumer products and business equipment 
our ability to achieve design wins is subject to several risks and uncertainties  including the potentially limited opportunities for design wins with respect to certain digital consumer products  such as video game products  due to a limited number of product manufacturers and the length of product life cycles  the risk that the performance  functionality  price and power characteristics of our designs may not satisfy those that are critical to specific digital consumer product applications  and our limited research and development and sales and marketing experience in our target markets due to our previous focus on the development of high performance processors for silicon graphics workstations and servers 
even if our technology is incorporated into new products  we cannot be certain that any such products will ultimately be brought to market  achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalties for us 
factors that negatively affect our semiconductor company licensees could adversely affect our business 
a significant portion of our total revenue has been derived from a limited number of semiconductor companies 
accordingly  factors negatively affecting a particular licensee could adversely effect our results of operations and financial condition if such licensee accounts for a significant portion of our revenue at the time 
we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success of our licensees  including  for example  the highly competitive environment in which they operate  the market for their products  their engineering capabilities and their financial and other resources 
revenue from our top two semiconductor company licensees represented an aggregate of in both fiscal and fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal we expect that this revenue concentration will continue in the future  although the identity of the particular licensees that will account for this revenue concentration may vary from period to period depending on the addition or expiration of contracts  the nature and timing of payments due under our contracts and the volumes and prices at which our licensees sell products incorporating our technology 
we depend on semiconductor companies and digital consumer product manufacturers to adopt our technology and use it in the products they sell 
the adoption and continued use of our technology by semiconductor companies and digital consumer product manufacturers is important to our continued success 
we face numerous risks in obtaining agreements with semiconductor companies and digital consumer product manufacturers on terms consistent with our business model  including the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with a potential licensee  the fact that we may compete with the internal design teams of semiconductor companies and digital consumer product manufacturers  the potential difficulties in persuading large semiconductor companies and digital consumer product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology  and to disclose to us proprietary manufacturing technology  and the potential difficulties in persuading potential licensees to bear certain development costs associated with our technology and to produce embedded processors using our technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current relationships or establish new relationships with additional licensees  and any failure by us to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  we are subject to risks beyond our control that influence the success or failure of a particular semiconductor company or digital consumer product manufacturer  including the competition it faces and the market acceptance of its products  its engineering  marketing and management capabilities and the technical challenges unrelated to our technology that it faces in developing its products  and its financial and other resources 
none of our current licensees are obligated to license new or future generations of our processor designs 
in addition  because we do not control the business practices of our licensees  we do not influence the degree to which our licensees promote our technology or set the prices at which the products incorporating our technology are sold to digital consumer product manufacturers 
our separation from silicon graphics may negatively affect certain of our existing licensee relationships  insofar as silicon graphics was a factor in establishing and maintaining the relationship or in negotiating the financial and other terms of our contracts with such licensees due to  for example  silicon graphics status as a customer of such licensees 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations that could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly financial results may vary significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our revenue components are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
because our expenses are largely independent of our revenue in any particular period  it is difficult to accurately forecast our operating results 
our operating expenses are based  in part  on anticipated future revenue and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenue is below expectations in any quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
in light of the foregoing  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
in addition  it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our class a common stock may fall 
factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter include the demand for and average selling prices of semiconductor products that incorporate our technology  the financial terms of our contractual arrangements with our semiconductor licensees  which may provide for significant up front payments or payments based on the achievement of certain milestones  the relative mix of contract revenue and royalties  competitive pressures resulting in lower contract revenue or royalty rates  our ability to develop  introduce and market new processor intellectual property  the establishment or loss of licensing relationships with semiconductor companies or digital consumer product manufacturers  the timing of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  changes in development schedules  research and development expenditure levels and product support by us and digital consumer product manufacturers  seasonal fluctuations  and general economic and market conditions 
we are dependent on the emerging market for digital consumer products and consumer acceptance of the products that incorporate our technology 
the digital consumer products industry is presently the primary market for our processor  core and related designs 
the market for digital consumer products is relatively new and emerging  and our success will depend largely on the level of consumer interest in digital consumer products  many of which have only recently been introduced to the market 
in addition  the timing and amount of royalties we receive will depend on consumer acceptance of the products that incorporate our technology 
we cannot assure you that any products that incorporate our technology will achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalties for us 
our dependence on the digital consumer products industry involves several risks and uncertainties  including changes in consumer requirements and preferences  the introduction of products by our competitors embodying new technologies or features  and the current lack of open industry standards for hardware and software in the digital consumer products industry 
if we are unable to develop enhancements and new generations of our intellectual property  our ability to achieve design wins may be adversely affected 
our future success will depend on our ability to develop enhancements and new generations of our processors  cores and other intellectual property that satisfy the requirements of specific product applications and introduce these new technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  or if the characteristics of our processor and related designs are not compatible with the requirements of specific product applications  our ability to achieve design wins may be limited 
our failure to achieve a sufficient number of design wins could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
technical innovations of the type critical to our success are inherently complex and involve several risks  including our ability to anticipate and timely respond to changes in the requirements of digital consumer product and business equipment manufacturers  our ability to anticipate and timely respond to changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes  changing consumer preferences in the digital consumer products market  the emergence of new standards in the semiconductor  digital consumer product or business equipment industries  the significant investment that is often required before commercial viability is determined  and the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
any failure by us to adequately address these risks could render our existing processor  core and related designs obsolete and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will have the financial and other resources necessary to develop processor  core and related designs in the future  or that any enhancements or new generations of the technology that we develop will generate revenue in excess of the costs of development 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or subject to claims of infringement 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as licensing agreements and employee and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent other parties from designing and marketing unauthorized mips based products or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies as ours 
moreover  our cross licensing arrangements  in which we license certain of our patents but do not generally transfer know how or other proprietary information  may facilitate the ability of our cross licensees  either alone or in conjunction with others  to develop competitive products and designs 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will be approved or that any of the patents that we own will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by others or be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry 
we cannot be certain that third parties will not make a claim of infringement against us or against our semiconductor company licensees or digital consumer product manufacturers in connection with their use of our technology 
any claims  even those without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us or one of our semiconductor manufacturing licensees in connection with its use of our technology could adversely affect our business 
we need to continue to develop our administrative infrastructure to support our business as a stand alone company 
prior to the separation of our business from that of silicon graphics in june  we operated as a division of silicon graphics and not as a separate stand alone company 
although we continue to be a majority owned subsidiary of silicon graphics  silicon graphics has no obligation to assist us except as provided in the management services agreement between the companies 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we fail to compete effectively in the market for embedded processors  our business will be adversely affected 
competition in the market for embedded processors is intense 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are performance  functionality  price  customizability and power consumption 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with other designers and developers of processors and cores  as well as semiconductor manufacturers whose product lines include processors for embedded and non embedded applications 
in addition  we may face competition from the producers of unauthorized mips based clones and non risc based technology designs 
to remain competitive  we must also differentiate our processors  cores and related designs from those available or under development by the internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers  including some of our current and prospective manufacturing licensees 
many of these internal design groups have substantial programming and design resources and are part of larger organizations with substantial financial and marketing resources 
these internal design groups may develop products that compete directly with ours or may actively seek to license their own technology to third party semiconductor manufacturers 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases as well as greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their technologies and products 
in addition  we may face competition from non risc based technology designs 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel to succeed 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and difficult to replace 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our officers or key employees 
we intend to hire additional highly skilled personnel  particularly technical personnel  for our anticipated research and development activities 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant experience in the semiconductor and processor design industries  is intense 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering personnel is essential to meet our business goals 
we have potential conflicts of interest with silicon graphics which could be resolved in a manner that adversely affects us 
conflicts of interest may arise between us and silicon graphics in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships  including potential competitive business activities  indemnification arrangements  including with respect to the separation of our business from that of silicon graphics and the recapitalization  potential acquisitions or financing transactions  sales or other dispositions by silicon graphics of shares of our common stock  including through the exercise of its registration rights or in a tax free distribution to its stockholders  the exercise by silicon graphics of its ability to control our management and affairs  and tax and intellectual property matters 
we cannot assure you that any conflicts that may arise between us and silicon graphics will be resolved in a manner that does not have a material adverse effect on us  even if such result is not intended by silicon graphics 
in addition  certain of the agreements that we entered into with silicon graphics in connection with the separation of our business from that of silicon graphics contain specific procedures for resolving disputes between the two companies with respect to the subject matter of those agreements 
we cannot assure you that more favorable results to us would not be obtained under different procedures 
silicon graphics does not currently engage in the design and development of processor intellectual property for embedded systems applications 
however  our certificate of incorporation provides that silicon graphics has no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar activities or lines of business as us 
ownership interests of our directors or officers in the common stock of silicon graphics or service as both a director of mips technologies and an officer or employee of silicon graphics could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and silicon graphics 
our certificate of incorporation includes provisions relating to the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for both us and silicon graphics based on the relationship to the companies of the individual to whom the opportunity is presented and the method by which it was presented in may  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with silicon graphics  nintendo co 
ltd 
and artx  inc in which nintendo agreed that  in the absence of certain litigation we and silicon graphics initiated against artx  inc  nintendo would refrain from asserting any claims based on its belief that certain disclosures in the registration statement for our initial public offering constituted a breach of the confidentiality obligations contained in our contract with nintendo 
although we and silicon graphics strongly disagree that any such breach has occurred  nintendo may assert any claims it believes it has against us with respect to the disclosures in such registration statement if silicon graphics reasserts its claims against artx  inc our revenue is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a substantial portion of our revenue has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from customers outside the united states  primarily in japan 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that the sales by our manufacturing licensees to their customers are denominated in foreign currencies  the royalties we receive on such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of the technology we sell to our licensees were to increase due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  demand for our technology could fall which would  in turn  reduce our royalties 
because we cannot predict the amount of non us dollar denominated revenue earned by our licensees  we have not historically attempted to mitigate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our revenue  and we do not presently intend to do so in the future 
we have grown rapidly  and if we are unable to manage this growth  our business will be adversely affected 
our ability to continue to grow successfully requires an effective planning and management process 
since june   we have increased our headcount substantially  from employees at that date to employees at june  this increase includes the addition of employees at our new development center in denmark  as well as additional employees in our engineering  sales and marketing staff 
our growth has placed  and the recruitment and integration of additional employees will continue to place  a strain on our resources 
digital consumer product manufacturers and our semiconductor manufacturing licensees typically require significant engineering support in the design  testing and manufacture of products incorporating our technology 
accordingly  increases in the adoption of our technology can be expected to increase the strain on our personnel  particularly our engineers 
our separation from silicon graphics may affect us in negotiating future licensing arrangements and resolving future intellectual property disputes 
we have entered into licensing arrangements with silicon graphics with respect to certain of its intellectual property that we use in our business 
as a result of the separation  however  we no longer have full access to silicon graphics patents and other intellectual property 
in the past  the mips group benefited from its status as a division of silicon graphics in its access to the intellectual property of third parties through licensing arrangements or otherwise  and in the negotiation of the financial and other terms of such arrangements 
the separation of our business from that of silicon graphics could adversely affect our ability to negotiate commercially attractive intellectual property licensing arrangements with third parties in the future 
moreover  in connection with future intellectual property infringement claims  we will not have the benefit of asserting counterclaims based on silicon graphics intellectual property portfolio  nor will we be able to provide licenses to silicon graphics intellectual property in order to resolve such claims 
year problems with the products or internal systems of our critical suppliers or third parties whose products incorporate our technology could adversely affect our business 
many computer programs and embedded date reliant systems use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs and systems that record only the last two digits of the calendar year may not be able to distinguish whether means or if not corrected  date related information and data could cause such programs or systems to fail or to generate erroneous information 
we are unable to directly assess the year compliance of products and technologies developed by others and incorporating our technology 
to the extent that any such third party product or technology is not year compliant  we may be adversely affected due to our association with such product or technology 
in addition  our revenue and operating results could become subject to unexpected fluctuations and could be adversely effected if our licensees or system original equipment manufacturers encounter year compliance problems that affect their ability to distribute products that incorporate our technology 
we have been contacting critical suppliers to determine whether the products and services they provide to us are year compliant 
a delay or failure by our critical suppliers to be year compliant could  in a worst case  interrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on investments of our excess cash 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
to achieve this objective and minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in money market funds operated by reputed financial institutions in the united states 
due to the nature of our investments  management has concluded that it does not have a material market risk exposure
