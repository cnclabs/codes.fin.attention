forward looking statements the above discussion contains forward looking statements 
there are certain important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made above 
these factors include  but are not limited to general performance of the economy  specifically as it affects the advertising industry  entertainment  television  video and broadcast industries  the international economic and political climate which could impact the sale of domestic programming overseas significant changes in video technology in the post production  video and communication industries  and the loss of key personnel  and the loss of key customers 
impact of year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of data sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failure 
the company has conducted a review of its computer information systems and its technological operating equipment to identify the systems that could be affected by the year compliance issue 
below are summaries of the review areas business systems all systems supported by the company s corporate information group and all programs used in operations have been inventoried as part of the year readiness 
inventoried programs and systems have been reviewed and modified to be year compliant 
the company uses purchased software programs for a variety of functions  including general ledger  accounts payable  and accounts receivable accounting packages as well as comprehensive facility management packages 
these programs are generally year compliant or have been repaired or upgraded and are now year compliant 
software and or computer systems not currently compliant will be upgraded during calendar under existing maintenance and other agreements and through normal replacement programs currently in place 
the company has moved to its fiscal accounting calendar commencing on july  without incident 
facilities the scope of the facilities project includes facilities management systems for example  temperature  humidity  automatic toilets building access  un interruptable power systems and elevators 
the facilities review was substantially complete at june  with no significant year issues noted 
equipment used in operations this review area includes the audio video equipment  switching equipment  graphics and special effects equipment  film to tape transfer and color correction equipment  standards conversion equipment  transmission and reception equipment and computer added design equipment 
the operations equipment project was substantially complete at june  with no significant year issues noted 
a review of the company s equipment containing embedded microprocessors or other technology has not revealed year compliance issues 
operation of this equipment is generally not time sensitive and  if necessary  equipment settings can be adjusted without posing any significant operational problems for the company 
suppliers products and readiness the company has reviewed its suppliers and identified key suppliers 
the key suppliers have been contacted regarding their year readiness 
based on responses  cost and the critical nature of the material involved contingency planning is being developed 
more specifically the inventory levels of blank tape and consumables may be increased 
the systems and products group s purchasing department along with the systems engineers have been incorporating year readiness in their purchase orders 
company services and products the company considers it services and manufactured products to be year ready 
most of the company s services and manufactured products have no date function and therefore have no year compliance issues 
the systems and products group is dependent on the year readiness of its suppliers and their products 
the company s remediation efforts are substantially complete and the focus is now being directed toward contingency planning 
management is confident in the company s ability to transition to the year without incident but will establish contingency plans in the event of unforeseen failures 
the company reasonably believes that its most likely worst case year impact would relate to problems with systems of suppliers and customers rather than with the company s internal systems or products 
the company has less control over the year assessment and remediation efforts of third parties and believes the risks are greatest with infrastructure providers power  water and communication services  logistics elements transportation and customs and suppliers of materials and services 
based on these reviews  costs of addressing remaining year compliance issues are not expected to exceed and costs incurred to date approximate to date  the company has not identified any system which presents a material risk of not being year ready in a timely fashion or for which a suitable alternative cannot be implemented 
as the company progresses with its year conversion  however  it may identify systems that do present a material risk of year disruption 
such disruption may include  among other things  the inability to process transactions or information  to record  access data  or engage in similar normal business activities 
if the company  its customers or vendors are unable to resolve such processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in a material financial risk 
accordingly  the company will devote the necessary resources to resolve all significant year issues in a timely manner 
the discussion above contains certain forward looking statements 
the costs of the year conversion  the date which the company has set to complete such conversion  and possible risks associated with the year issue are based on the company s current estimates and are subject to various uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
such uncertainties include  among others  the success of the company in identifying systems that are not year compliant  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected systems  the availability of qualified personnel  consultants and other resources  and the success of the year conversion efforts of others 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address these risks the company entered into an interest rate swap as described below 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
credit risks the company s customer base is composed of companies in the television network  cable and advertising industries which are located principally throughout the united states 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales during the fiscal year ended june  and interest rate risks the company hedges its exposure to changes in interest rates on its senior secured term loan 
in august  the company entered into a five year interest rate hedge agreement with a total notional principal amount of  to manage interest costs associated with changing interest rates 
this agreement converts underlying variable rate debt based on libor under the company s term loan to fixed rate debt with an interest rate of plus a number of basis points based upon the company s leverage ratio 
the following tables provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rate 
for debt obligations  the table presents cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract
