item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
certain of the matters discussed herein and elsewhere in this form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and as such may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of interpool to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
general the company generates revenues through leasing transportation equipment  primarily dry cargo containers and container chassis 
most of the company s revenues are derived from payments under operating leases and income earned under finance leases  under which the lessee has the right to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
revenue derived from an operating lease generally consists of the total lease payment from the customer 
in  and  revenues derived from operating leases were million of revenues  million of revenues  and million of revenues  respectively 
revenue derived from a direct finance lease consists only of income recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method 
the principal component of the direct finance lease payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in the direct finance lease 
in  and  total payments from direct finance leases were million  million and million  respectively 
the revenue component of total lease payments totalled million of revenues  million of revenues and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
the company s mix of operating and direct finance leases is a function of customer preference and demand and the company s success in meeting those customer requirements 
during the initial two years of either an operating lease or a direct finance lease  the contribution to the company s earnings before interest and taxes is very similar 
in subsequent periods  however  the operating lease will generally be more profitable than a direct finance lease  primarily due to the return of principal inherent in a direct finance lease 
however  after the long term portion and any renewal of an operating lease expires  the operating lease will have redeployment costs and related risks which are avoided under a direct finance lease 
the company conducts business with shipping line customers throughout the world and is thus subject to the risks of operating in disparate political and economic conditions 
offsetting this risk is the worldwide nature of the shipping business and the ability of the company s shipping line customers to shift their operations from areas of unfavorable political and or economic conditions to more promising areas 
substantially all of the company s revenues are billed and paid in us dollars 
in addition  the company s container purchases are paid for in us dollars 
the company believes these factors substantially mitigate foreign currency rate risks 
certain of the shipping lines to which the company leases containers are entities domiciled in several asian countries 
in addition  many of the company s customers are substantially dependent upon shipments of goods exported from asia 
economic disruption  political instability or military disturbances in these areas of the world could adversely affect the company 
although the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its business as a result of the recent financial conditions in certain asian markets  there can be no assurance that financial turmoil in one or more of the asian markets would not adversely affect the company s business 
the company s container leasing operations are conducted through interpool limited  a barbados corporation 
the company s effective tax rate benefits substantially from the application of an income tax convention  pursuant to which the profits of interpool limited from container leasing operations are exempt from federal taxation in the united states 
such profits are subject to barbados tax at rates which are significantly lower than the applicable rates in the united states 
see united states federal income tax 
the company s chassis leasing operations are conducted primarily through trac lease 
certain other united states equipment leasing activities are conducted through interpool itself 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gain and losses to offset related results on the hedge item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement the statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance that is  fiscal quarters beginning june  and thereafter 
statement cannot be applied retroactively 
statement must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  and  at the company s election before january  
the company has not yet quantified the impacts of adopting statement on its financial statements and has not determined the timing or method of our adoption of statement however  the statement could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income

as a result of the factors described above  the company s net income decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company uses funds from various sources to finance the acquisition of equipment for lease to customers 
the primary funding sources are cash provided by operations  borrowings  generally from banks  the issuance of capital lease obligations and the sale of the company s debt securities 
in addition  the company generates cash from the sale of equipment being retired from the company s fleet 
in general  the company seeks to meet debt service requirements from the leasing revenue generated by its equipment 
since  the company has been steadily increasing its fleet of containers and adding to its portfolio of finance leases 
the company generated cash flow from operations of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in net cash provided by financing activities was million resulting from the issuance of debt and capital securities in excess of debt payments and dividends paid 
in and  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million  the result of the proceeds from the issuance of debt in excess of debt repayment and dividends paid 
the company has purchased equipment costing million in  million in and million in the company has a million revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks  on december   million was outstanding 
the term of this facility extends until may  unless the lenders elect to renew the facility at which time a maximum of of the amount then outstanding becomes due  with the remainder becoming payable in equal monthly installments over a five year period 
in addition  as of december   the company had available lines of credit of million under various facilities  under which million was outstanding 
interest rates under these facilities ranged from to 
at december   the company had total debt outstanding of million

on september   the company consummated an exchange offer whereby the entire million principal amount of private notes were exchanged for the same principal amount of interpool notes due the exchange notes  which have been registered under the securities act 
the private notes were originally issued and sold in a transaction exempt from registration under the securities act 
the exchange notes issued in the exchange offer have substantially the same terms and conditions as the unregistered private notes  except that the exchange notes are not subject to the restrictions on resale or transfer  which applied to the unregistered private notes 
on april   the company acquired a interest in cai  a container leasing company whose business is primarily in the short term master lease market 
cai would not be deemed a significant subsidiary of the company for purposes of the securities and exchange commission accounting requirements 
the company also advanced cai subordinate debt 
the company s investment in and advances to cai totaled approximately million 
as of december   commitments for capital expenditures totaled approximately million 
the company expects to fund such capital expenditures through some combination of cash flow from the company s operations  borrowings under its available credit facilities and additional funds raised through the sale of its debt securities in the private and or public markets 
the company believes that cash generated by continuing operations  together with existing short term credit facilities  the issuance of debt securities in the appropriate markets and the portion of the proceeds remaining from recent debt security sales will be sufficient to finance the company s working capital needs for its existing business  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments over the next twelve months 
the company anticipates that long term financing will continue to be available for the purchase of equipment to expand its business in the future 
in addition  from time to time interpool explores new sources of capital both at the parent and subsidiary levels 
the following table sets forth certain historical cash flow information for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities proceeds from disposition of leasing equipment acquisition of leasing equipment investment in direct financing leases net proceeds of issuance of long term debt and capital leases obligations in excess of payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations the company invests its available funds in financial instruments and on occasion makes investments in other businesses 
from time to time  the company enters into discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions or business combinations 
if additional capital were to be required for any such acquisition  there can be no assurance that such additional capital would be available on terms acceptable to the company 
on january   the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which the company may offer from time to time up to million aggregate principal amount of its debt and or equity securities 
as of march   this registration statement has not yet become effective 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts totalling million 
the terms of the interest rate swap contacts are for three  five and seven years 
the interest rate swap contracts convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the maturity of these contracts coincides with the maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
in  the company entered into a five year interest rate swap contract  with a notional amount of million to convert variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
the maturity of this contract coincides with the principal and maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
the notional amount was reduced for when a portion of the debt was retired 
at december   the notional amount was approximately million 
interest rate swap contracts are intended to be an integral part of borrowing transactions and  therefore are not recognized at fair value 
interest differentials paid or received under these contracts are recognized as yield adjustments to the effective yield of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
interest rate swap contracts would only be recognized at fair value if the hedged relationship is terminated 
gains or losses accumulated prior to termination of the relationship would be amortized as a yield adjustment over the shorter of the remaining life of the contract  or the remaining period to maturity of the underlying debt instrument hedged 
if the contract remained outstanding after termination of the hedged relationship  subsequent changes in market value of the contract would be recognized in earnings 
the company does not use leveraged swaps and does not use leverage in any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
united states federal income tax the company is subject to federal and state income taxes as a subchapter c corporation under the internal revenue code the code 
the company  trac lease  inc and other united states subsidiaries file a consolidated united states federal income tax return 
this consolidated group is liable for federal income taxes on its worldwide income 
personal holding company issues 
if the company or any of its subsidiaries were classified as a personal holding company  such corporation s undistributed personal holding company income would be subject to a federal income tax of in addition to its regular federal income tax liability 
the federal income tax laws have two requirements for classifying a company as a personal holding company 
the company and its subsidiaries currently satisfy the first requirement  the ownership of more than of the value of the company s stock by five or fewer individuals 
whether or not the company or any of its subsidiaries satisfies the second requirement  that at least of such corporation s adjusted ordinary gross income constitutes personal holding company income  will depend upon such corporation s income mix 
based upon current management projections  interpool will likely be considered a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes in and possibly in subsequent years 
if interpool or any of its subsidiaries were to be classified as a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes  in addition to its regular federal income tax liability  interpool s or such subsidiary s undistributed personal holding company income generally  taxable income with certain adjustments  including a deduction for federal income taxes and dividends paid would be subject to a personal holding company tax of 
management anticipates that in interpool s current level of dividends would be sufficient to avoid having any undistributed personal holding company income  and thus does not anticipate that there will be any personal holding company tax imposed in there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not at some point in the future become liable for such personal holding company tax 
furthermore  the company may at some point in the future elect to increase the dividend rate on its common stock in order to avoid such tax 
trac lease 
trac lease has approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which may be used only to offset the income of trac lease and  if not utilized  will expire between and the use of substantially all these loss carryforwards is subject to a number of limitations under federal tax laws 
the company has incurred certain losses from leasing activities that are characterized for tax purposes as suspended passive losses 
these losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset income from future leasing activities 
as of december  such suspended passive losses totalled approximately million 
interpool limited 
under certain circumstances  the company may be liable for united states federal income taxes on earnings of interpool limited and any other foreign subsidiaries of the company  whether or not such earnings are distributed to the company 
this would occur if interpool limited realized subpart f income as defined in the code  if it were deemed to be a foreign personal holding company or a passive foreign investment company  or if it were to have an increase in earnings invested in united states property 
subpart f income includes foreign personal holding company income  such as dividends  interest and rents 
although a substantial portion of interpool limited s income consists of rents from container leasing activities  the company believes that such rents are not subpart f income because they are derived from the active conduct of a trade or business and received from unrelated persons 
however  interpool limited has received some dividend and interest income in and  which was taxed as subpart f income 
if interpool limited were treated as a foreign personal holding company for any year  the company would be taxed on the amount the company would have received if interpool limited had distributed all its income to the company as a dividend 
one of the conditions for treating a foreign subsidiary as a foreign personal holding company is that a minimum of of the foreign subsidiary s gross income must be foreign personal holding company income 
foreign personal holding company income does not include rental income that constitutes at least of the subsidiary s gross income 
because the company expects that rental income will constitute at least of interpool limited s gross income  the company does not anticipate that interpool limited will be deemed a foreign personal holding company 
a foreign corporation such as interpool limited is a passive foreign investment company if or more of its gross income is foreign personal holding company income or the average percentage of assets by value held by such corporation during the taxable year which produce foreign personal holding company income is at least 
the company does not believe that interpool limited is a passive foreign investment company 
if interpool limited were to become a passive foreign investment company  the company would make the election to treat interpool limited as a qualified electing fund with the result that the company would be taxed each year on interpool limited s entire earnings 
the taxpayer relief act of eliminated application of the passive foreign investment company rules for the company for years after a parent company is also subject to taxation when a foreign subsidiary increases the amount of its earnings invested in united states property during any calendar year 
the company does not expect that interpool limited will invest any earnings in united states property 
the revenue reconciliation act of added a new type of shareholder income inclusion where a foreign subsidiary has its post december  earnings invested in excess passive assets 
because the company believes that more than of the adjusted basis of interpool limited s assets will constitute assets used in the active conduct of a trade or business generating income from unrelated persons  rather than passive assets  the company does not expect that the provisions dealing with excess passive assets will apply 
the small business job protection act of repealed the income inclusion for years after united states barbados income tax convention 
interpool limited s business is managed and controlled in barbados  it also has a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the tax convention  any profits of interpool limited from leasing of containers used in international trade generally are taxable only in barbados and not in the united states 
for its taxable years commencing prior to january   interpool limited is entitled to the benefits of the tax convention for each year that more than of the shares of interpool limited are owned  directly or indirectly  by united states citizens or residents the stock ownership test and its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to meet liabilities to persons who are not residents or citizens of the united states the base erosion test 
the company believes that interpool limited passes both of these tests and should continue to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  but there can be no assurance as to such continued eligibility 
if interpool limited ceased to be eligible for the benefits of the tax convention  a substantial portion of its income would become subject to the united states federal income tax and the branch profits tax 
a protocol to the tax convention has been ratified by the united states and barbados which amends the eligibility provision of the tax convention  making the stock ownership test easier to satisfy and the base erosion test more difficult to satisfy 
the protocol became effective on january  and applies to taxable years of interpool limited commencing on or after that date 
the company believes that interpool limited will continue to satisfy the base erosion test and remain eligible for the benefits of the tax convention after neither the tax convention nor the protocol affords interpool limited any relief from the personal holding company tax or the accumulated earnings tax 
to the extent that interpool limited has united states source income that is personal holding company income or is not needed in its business  interpool limited could be taxed on such income unless such income is distributed to the company as a dividend 
the company expects that interpool limited would distribute any such income to the company 
state and local taxes income taxes 
the company and trac lease are liable for state and local income taxes on their income  and interpool limited is liable for state and local income taxes on its earnings attributable to operations in the united states 
sales tax 
to date  interpool limited and trac lease generally have not paid sales taxes on their leasing revenues to the states in which they conduct business because management has believed such revenues to be exempt from state sales taxes on several grounds  including a long standing interpretation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution that would prohibit the imposition of a tax on cargo containers and chassis used primarily for transportation of goods in interstate commerce or international trade 
recently  itel containers international corp 
itel  a container leasing company  challenged an attempt by the state of tennessee to collect sales tax on itel s proceeds from the leasing of containers delivered in tennessee 
in a ruling by the united states supreme court in february  itel s position was rejected and the court upheld the right of tennessee to impose sales tax on leasing revenues from containers delivered in tennessee 
the company cannot predict the extent to which states other than tennessee will now attempt to collect sales tax on the company s equipment leasing revenues based on this supreme court decision 
under the terms of the company s equipment leases  the company would be entitled to pass any such sales tax on to its lessees 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset through economies of scale achieved through expansion of the business 
year the company has undertaken a program to address the issues associated with the onset of the calendar year yk 
during  a working group comprised of senior management and members from potentially effected departments formed to determine the full scope and related costs of yk issues to insure that the company s systems continue to meet its internal needs and those of its customers 
the yk working group meets periodically and reports its findings and plans to the company s board of directors 
the assessment phase of the yk project was completed on august  all internal systems  hardware  software  and embedded were evaluated for yk compliance 
software source code for in house developed systems was analyzed to determine program cognizance of yk 
the analysis resulted in the need to upgrade or replace three of the company s four software systems the fleet management system  the accounting system for accounts payable and general ledger  and the overseas data input program 
the fourth program  poolstat tm  has been developed over the past two years using yk coding practices 
testing of poolstat tm was carried out against software developed in house  resulting in demonstrated compliance 
testing resulted in demonstrated compliance of all data servers  and the need to replace a specified number of personal computers of a specific age and model 
testing was also carried out on internal systems with embedded clocks and calendars  including the telephone pbx systems 
the result indicated that the pbx in both headquarters needed replacing 
the new york office pbx was replaced on december  and the princeton office pbx will be replaced by the middle of may  the budget for the yk project is  the allocation of  was associated with time and tools associated with the assessment  and the purchase of a replacement accounting system 
the budget of  is primarily associated with the purchase of new desktop computer systems  a new telephone pbx system for the company s princeton office  and the cost of in house labor for modification of date portions of internal software 
while most of the company s desktop computers were slated for replacement regardless of yk concerns  the presence of yk compliance problems have accelerated this effort 
the budget for the project in the year is  and covers additional documentation work and cosmetic work for display of dates as either or as users request 
the company s expenditures to date have been significantly less than budgeted for hardware  due to industry wide price reductions 
expenditures for labor to date have been less than budgeted as the completion of other projects has pushed back the yk remediation timeline 
the company is now fully engaged in remediation efforts and will be on or below budget for the entire project 
the original timeframe  developed in august of  has also been revised 
full yk compliance is now expected by june  the company recognizes that there are additional yk factors related to its dependence on other business partners  including customers  suppliers  and service providers 
because our business partners yk projects are beyond the company s control  it is necessary to determine the level of risk currently posed by these dependencies 
the company developed a questionnaire requesting yk project information  which has been sent to over business partners  including approximately of all customers and all key suppliers and service providers 
the majority of questionnaires are expected to be returned before the end of april  potential risk from yk failures by outside companies can be categorized by type of business partner 
risk from customer failure is two fold potential inability to pay invoices in a timely manner  and potential loss of effective tracking of the company s assets on lease and in their possession 
there is some concern that asian headquartered shipping lines have been focussing on the effects of the asian crisis and therefore may not be giving the yk problem sufficient attention 
the potential inability of customers to pay invoices may cause the company to seek alternate financing to meet its obligations 
the yk working group will be paying special attention to the questionnaire responses from this customer segment 
key suppliers are those which would require significant effort to replace if the flow of goods were affected 
particular companies of concern are manufacturers and re manufacturers of chassis  and manufacturers of containers 
two container manufacturers account for over of new container purchases 
alternate sources will be examined as part of a contingency plan 
service providers of primary concern are banks and financial institutions with which the company has lines of credit 
the responses to the questionnaire will help determine the extent to which contingency plans must be made for the company to continue with uninterrupted business 
this contingency plan is being developed to deal with interruptions in the flow of goods  services  and or funds which could be deemed possible based on the responses to the questionnaires 
the contingency plan is expected to be completed by may  updates to the questionnaire will be requested periodically during the last half of from companies who have disclosed a high degree of risk  and who could significantly impact the company s business 
at this time  the company  if necessary  would begin implementation of its contingency plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
the company manages interest rate risk to protect its margins on existing transactions 
interest rate risk is the risk of earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates 
additionally  the company considers interest rate swap contracts as an integral part of borrowing transactions 
the company seeks to minimize its exposure by entering into amortizing interest rate swap contracts  which coincide with the principal and maturity of the underlying debt instruments hedged 
the company does not use leveraged swaps and does not use leverage in any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
for  a change in interest rates would result in a 
million change in pretax earnings of the company
