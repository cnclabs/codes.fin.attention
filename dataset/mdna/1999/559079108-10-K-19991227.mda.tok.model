item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to june  the company derived the majority of its revenue from providing behavioral healthcare services in an inpatient setting 
payments from third party payors are the principal source of revenue for most behavioral healthcare providers 
in the early s  many third party payors sought to control the cost of providing care to their patients by instituting managed care programs or seeking the assistance of managed care companies 
providers participating in managed care programs agree to provide services to patients for a discount from established rates  which generally results in pricing concessions by the providers and lower margins 
additionally  managed care programs generally encourage alternatives to inpatient treatment settings and reduce utilization of inpatient services 
as a result  third party payors established managed care programs or engaged managed care companies in many areas of healthcare  including behavioral healthcare 
the company  which until june  was the largest operator of psychiatric hospitals in the united states  was adversely affected by the adoption of managed care programs as the principal cost control measure of third party payors 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal  the company was not engaged in the behavioral managed healthcare business 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired a ownership interest in green spring health services  inc green spring 
at that time  the company intended to become a fully integrated behavioral healthcare provider by combining the behavorial managed healthcare products offered by green spring with the direct treatment services offered by the company s psychiatric hospitals 
the company believed that an entity that participated in both the managed care and the provider segments of the behavioral healthcare industry could more efficiently provide and manage behavioral healthcare for insured populations than an entity that was solely a managed care company 
the company also believed that earnings from its behavioral managed care business would offset  in part  the negative impact on the financial performance of its psychiatric hospitals caused by managed care 
green spring was the company s first significant involvement in behavioral managed healthcare 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the minority stockholders of green spring converted their ownership interest in green spring into an aggregate of  shares of magellan common stock

under the company s majority ownership  green spring increased its base of covered lives from million at of the end of calendar year to million at the end of calendar year  a compound annual growth rate of over 
while growth in the industry was accelerating  the behavioral managed healthcare industry also began to consolidate 
the company concluded that this consolidation presented an opportunity for it to increase its participation in the behavioral managed healthcare industry  which the company believed offered growth and earnings prospects superior to those of the psychiatric hospital industry 
therefore  the company decided to sell its domestic psychiatric facilities to obtain capital for expansion of its behavioral managed healthcare business 
on june   the company consummated the crescent transactions which provided the company with approximately million of net cash proceeds  after debt repayment  for use in implementing its business strategy to increase its participation in the managed healthcare industry

the company provides these services primarily through i risk based products  where the company assumes all or a portion of the responsibility for the cost of providing treatment services in exchange for a fixed per member per month fee  ii aso products  where the company provides services such as utilization review  claims administration or provider network management  iii eaps and iv products which combine features of some or all of the company s risk based  aso  or eap products 
the human services business

the company s future operating performance and ability to service or refinance the notes or to extend or refinance the indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
restrictive financing covenants

 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries arb fas  about the conditions under which the company s consolidated financial statements should include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of subsidiaries which are less than wholly owned along with those of the company and its subsidiaries 
in general  arb fas requires consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries except those for which control is temporary or does not rest with the majority owner 
under the arb fas approach  instances of control not resting with the majority owner were generally regarded to arise from such events as the legal reorganization or bankruptcy of the majority owned subsidiary 
eitf expands the definition of instances in which control does not rest with the majority owner to include those where significant approval or veto rights  other than those which are merely protective of the minority shareholder s interest  are held by the minority shareholder or shareholders substantive participating rights 
substantive participating rights include  but are not limited to i selecting  terminating and setting the compensation of management responsible for implementing the majority owned subsidiary s policies and procedures and ii establishing operating and capital decisions of the majority owned subsidiary  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
the provisions of eitf apply to new investment agreements made after july   and to existing agreements which are modified after such date 
the company has made no new investments  and has modified no existing investments  to which the provisions of eitf would have applied 
in addition  the transition provisions of eitf must be applied to majority owned subsidiaries previously consolidated under arb fas for which the underlying agreements have not been modified in financial statements issued for years ending after december  fiscal for the company

the year computer problem is the inability of computer systems which store dates by using the last two digits of the year ie for to reliably recognize that dates after december  are later than  and not before  for instance  the date january   may be mistakenly interpreted as january   in calculations involving dates on systems which are non year compliant 
the company relies on information technology it systems and other systems and facilities such as telephones  building access control systems and heating and ventilation equipment embedded systems to conduct its business 
these systems are potentially vulnerable to year problems due to their use of the date information 
the company also has business relationships with customers and healthcare providers and other critical vendors who are themselves reliant on it and embedded systems to conduct their businesses 
state of readiness 
the company s it systems are largely decentralized  with each major operating unit having its own standards for systems which include both purchased and internally developed software 
the company s it hardware infrastructure is built mainly around mid range computers and ibm pc compatible servers and desktop systems 
the company s principal means of ensuring year readiness for purchased software has been the replacement  upgrade or repair of non compliant systems 
this replacement process would have been undertaken for business reasons irrespective of the year problem  however  it would  more than likely  have been implemented over a longer period of time 
the company s internally developed software was either designed to be year ready from inception or have been modified to be year ready and has gone through an independent verification and validation process 
the company believes its mission critical systems have been remediated to a state of year readiness 
to successfully prepare for the year  a program management office pmo was established by the company 
the pmo s responsibility is to provide oversight to the year project  develop plans  policies and procedures  manage risk  as well as perform independent verification and validation for the company s year readiness 
each of the company s major operating units has a chief information officer who is responsible for ensuring that all year issues are addressed and mitigated before any computational problems related to dates after december   occur 
the company s plan for it systems consists of several phases  primarily i inventory identifying all it systems and the magnitude of year readiness risk of each according to its potential business impact  ii date assessment identifying it systems that use date functions and assessing them for year functionality  iii remediation reprogramming  replacing or upgrading where necessary  inventoried items to ensure they are year ready  and iv testing and certification testing the code modifications and new inventory with other associated systems  including extensive date testing and performing quality assurance testing to ensure successful operation in the post environment 
the company has completed the inventory and assessment phases for substantially all of its it systems 
the company has completed the remediation  testing and certification of substantially all of its it systems 
the company leases most of the office space in which its reliance on embedded systems presents a potential problem and has been working with the respective lessors to identify any potential year problems related to these embedded systems 
responses concerning year readiness have been received and assessed from all facilities considered mission critical 
risk has been determined for each facility and follow up activities continue to ensure that facilities remain a low risk for year the company believes that its year projects have been substantially completed 
external relationships 
the company also faces the risk that one or more of its critical suppliers or customers external relationships will not be able to interact with the company due to the third party s inability to resolve its own year issues  including those associated with its own external relationships 
the company has completed its inventory of external relationships and risk rated each external relationship based upon the potential business impact  available alternatives and cost of substitution 
the company determined the overall year readiness of its external relationships 
in the case of significant customers and mission critical suppliers such as banks  telecommunications providers and other utilities and it vendors  the company has been engaged in discussions with the third parties and has  in many cases  obtainined detailed information as to those parties year plans and state of readiness 
year costs 
total costs incurred solely for remediation of potential year problems were approximately million in fiscal a large majority of these costs were incremental expenses that will not recur in calendar or thereafter 
the company expenses these costs as incurred and funds these costs through operating cash flows 
in addition  the company estimates that it has accelerated approximately million of capital expenditures that would have been budgeted for future periods into fiscal to ensure year readiness for outdated systems 
year readiness is critical to the company 
the company has redeployed some resources from non critical system enhancements to address year issues 
due to the importance of it systems to the company s business  management has deferred non critical systems enhancements to become year ready 
the company does not expect these redeployments and deferrals to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
risks and contingency recovery planning 
if the company s year issues were unresolved  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would include  among other possibilities  the inability to accurately and timely authorize and process benefits and claims  accurately bill customers  assess claims exposure  determine liquidity requirements  report accurate data to management  stockholders  customers  regulators and others  cause business interruptions or shutdowns  financial losses  reputational harm  loss of significant customers  increased scrutiny by regulators and litigation related to year issues 
the company is attempting to limit the potential impact of the year by monitoring the progress of its own year project and those of its critical external relationships and by developing contingency recovery plans 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to resolve all of its year issues 
any critical unresolved year issues at the company or its external relationships  however  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company has developed  or is developing  contingency recovery plans aimed at ensuring the continuity of critical business functions before and after december  as part of that process  the company has substantially completed the development of manual work alternatives to automated processes which should both ensure business continuity and provide a ready source of input to affected systems when they are returned to an operational status 
these manual alternatives presume  however  that basic infrastructure such as electrical power and telephone service  as well as purchased systems which are advertised to be year ready by their manufacturers primarily personal computers and productivity software will remain unaffected by the year problem 
contingency planning activities will continue through calendar year end 
activities consist of  but are not limited to  plan verification of all key corporate functions  establishment of response teams and associated war rooms  testing of call centers telephone re routing strategy and rehearsal for year end transition
