in addition  but to a significantly lesser extent  the company provides floor plan financing and secured working capital loans to dealers  secured by the related vehicle inventory and any future cash collections owed to the dealer on contracts accepted under the company s program 
the company s relationship with a dealer is defined by i the servicing agreement which sets forth the terms and conditions associated with the company s acceptance of a contract from a dealer  and ii the contract  which is a retail installment sales contract between a dealer and a purchaser of a used vehicle  providing for payment over a specified term 
the dealer assigns title to the contract and the security interest in the vehicle to the company 
thereafter  the rights and obligations of the company and the dealer are defined by the servicing agreement  which provides that a contract is assigned to the company as nominee for the dealer for purposes of administration  servicing and collection of the amount due under the assigned contract  as well as for security purposes 
the company takes title to the contract as nominee and records the gross amount of the contract as a gross installment contract receivable and the amount of its servicing fee see below as an unearned finance charge which  for balance sheet purposes  is netted from the gross amount of the contract 
the company records the remaining portion of the contract the gross amount of the contract less the unearned finance charge as a dealer holdback 
for balance sheet purposes  dealer holdbacks are shown net of any advances made by the company to the dealer in connection with accepting the assignment of a contract 
the company s program allows dealers to establish the interest rate on contracts  which typically is the maximum rate allowable by the state or country in which the dealer is doing business 
as the majority of the company s revenue is derived from the servicing fee it receives on the gross amount due under the contract typically of the principal and interest  the company s revenues from servicing fees are not materially impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company s revenue is principally dependent upon the gross value of contracts accepted  which is determined by the number of contracts accepted and the amount of the average contract 
the contracts assigned to the company are i secured by the related vehicle  and ii short term in duration generally maturing in to months  with an initial average maturity of approximately months 
the interest rates charged on floor plan financing typically range from to per annum and interest rates charged on secured working capital loans are typically prime plus 
the company s subsidiaries provide additional services to dealers 
one such subsidiary is primarily engaged in the business of reinsuring credit life and disability insurance policies issued to borrowers under contracts originated by dealers 
credit life and disability insurance premiums are ceded to the subsidiary on both an earned and written basis and are earned over the life of the contracts using pro rata and sum of digits methods 
another subsidiary administers short term limited extended service contracts offered by dealers 
in connection therewith  the subsidiary bears the risk of loss for any repairs covered under the service contract 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contracts 
in addition  the subsidiary has relationships with third party service contract providers which pay the subsidiary a fee on service contracts included on installment contracts financed through participating dealers 
the subsidiary does not bear the risk of loss for covered claims on these third party service contracts 
the income from the non refundable fee is recognized upon acceptance of the installment contract 
a third subsidiary is engaged in the business of reinsuring collateral protection insurance coverage issued to borrowers under contracts originated by dealers 
premiums are ceded to the subsidiary on both an earned and written basis and are earned over the life of the contracts using pro rata and sum of digits methods 
in addition  the company s credit reporting subsidiary provides credit information and consumer reports to companies servicing the non prime consumer market 
furthermore  the company s auction service subsidiary provides vehicle suppliers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles to buyers at the auctions 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percent relationship of certain items to total revenue for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  percent of total revenues finance charges premiums earned dealer enrollment fees gain on sale of advance receivables  net other income total revenue operating expenses provision for credit losses provision for claims interest total costs and expenses operating income foreign exchange loss income before income taxes provision credit for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue 
total revenue decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in finance charge revenue resulting from a decrease in the average installment contracts receivable balance 
the decrease in gross installment contracts receivable is primarily the result of collections on and charge offs of installment contracts exceeding contract originations for the period 
the company s volume of contract originations decreased in the fourth quarter of and in as the company has implemented more conservative advance programs and has limited business with marginally profitable and unprofitable dealers 
these changes were made primarily as a result of the company s enhanced analysis made possible by the company s loan servicing system which became operational in the third quarter of based on this review of dealer profitability  the company has discontinued relationships with certain dealers and continues to monitor its relationships with dealers and make adjustments to these relationships as required 
it is expected that the volume of contract originations will continue at lower levels than those experienced prior to the implementation of these changes 
the average yield on the company s installment contract portfolio  calculated using finance charge revenue divided by average installment contracts receivable  was approximately and in and  respectively 
the increase in the average yield is due to a decrease in the percentage of installment contracts which were in non accrual status as well as improvements in collection levels on non accrual installment contracts 
the percentage of installment contracts which were in non accrual status was and as of december  and  respectively 
premiums earned increased  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in premiums on the company s service contract program are earned on a straight line basis over the life of the service contracts 
premiums reinsured under the company s credit life and collateral protection insurance programs are earned over the life of the contracts using the pro rata and sum of digits methods 
as a result of these revenue recognition methods  premiums earned decreased at a slower rate than the decrease in finance charges 
in addition  the increase is due to an increase in the penetration rate on the company s service contract and credit life insurance programs 
earned dealer enrollment fees decreased  as a percentage of total revenue  from to for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease is due to a decline in the number of new dealers enrolling in the company s financing program 
the company has become more selective with respect to the enrollment of new dealers in an effort to improve the performance of its portfolio of installment contracts receivable 
in july  the company recognized a net gain on sale of advance receivables of approximately  the gain resulted from the securitization of dealer advances having a carrying value of approximately million 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the gain represents the difference between the sale proceeds to the company  net of transaction costs  and the company s carrying amount of the dealers advances  plus the present value of the estimated cash flows to be received by the company 
in determining the gain on sale of receivables  the company assumed an excess cash flow discount rate of  cumulative credit losses of and an interest rate on the underlying debt of 
the present value of such estimated excess cash flows has been recorded by the company as a retained interest in securitization of million as of december  the installment contracts supporting the dealer advances include contracts with origination dates ranging from july to june  with a weighted average age of months 
the amount of such contracts included on the company s balance sheet as of june  was million  of which million was in non accrual status 
in addition  the advances are supported by installment contracts which had been previously written off for financial statement purposes 
the excess cash flows result from the amount by which projected collections on the installment contracts exceeds i the principal and interest to be paid on the commercial paper and ii the amount of dealer holdback due to dealers 
in the securitization  the company retained servicing responsibilities and subordinated interests 
the company receives monthly servicing fees of of the collections on the installment contracts receivable  and rights to future cash flows arising after the investors in the commercial paper received the return for which they are contracted 
the investors have no recourse to the company s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
the company s retained interests are generally restricted until investors have been fully paid and are subordinate to investors interests 
their value is subject to substantial credit and interest rate risk and the timing of projected collections on the transferred financial assets 
other income increased  as a percent of total revenue  from in to in the increase is primarily due to i revenues from the company s auction services business which the company began operating in june  ii an increase in revenues from the company s credit reporting subsidiary and iii servicing fees and interest earned on the retained interest in securitization resulting from the company s securitization of advance receivables in july the increase is offset by a decrease in fees earned on third party service contract products offered by dealers on installment contracts  as the volume of this business has declined proportionately with the decline in contract originations 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  as a percent of total revenue  increased from in to in operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages  general and administrative  and sales and marketing expenses 
the increase for the period is due in part to an increase in salaries and wages 
salaries and wages increased due to i increases in the company s average wage rates necessary to attract and retain quality personnel  ii the company s purchase of the auction services business in june  iii information technology personnel added to maintain the company s new computer systems and applications and  iv severance compensation paid to or accrued for an executive who terminated employment in a portion of management personnel compensation paid by the company is charged to a company controlled by the company s chairman the affiliated company  based upon the percentage of time spent working for the affiliated company 
the company charged the affiliated company approximately  and  in and  respectively 
shared employees devote between and of their time to the company  depending on their responsibilities 
the company believes that the amounts charged by the company are representative of the respective employees activities 
in addition  the increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in general and administrative expenses 
these expenses were higher in primarily due to increases in i legal fees and settlement provisions resulting from an increase in the frequency and magnitude of litigation against the company see item legal proceedings  ii depreciation and amortization primarily resulting from the addition of new computer systems in and  iii audit fees charged by the company s independent auditors 
also  the increase results from general and administrative expenses at the company s auction services subsidiary 
provision for credit losses 
the amount provided for credit losses  as a percent of total revenue  decreased from in to in the provision for the year ended december  included a charge recorded to reflect the enhancements in the company s methodology for estimating its reserve for advances made possible by a new loan servicing system implemented by the company 
utilizing the new information made available upon the successful implementation of this new system  the company undertook an extensive review of its exposure related to dealer advances using a static pool analysis on a per dealer basis 
in order to reflect the impact of this analysis on the company s advance reserve  additional provisions were recorded in the provision for credit losses consists of two components i a provision for loan losses for the earned but unpaid servicing fees or finance charges recognized on contractually delinquent installment contracts and ii a provision for losses on advances to dealers that are not expected to be recovered through collections on the related installment contract receivable portfolio 
the decreases were primarily due to lower provisions needed for advance losses  based on the company s static pool analysis 
advance balances are continually reviewed by management utilizing the company s loan servicing system which allows management to estimate future collections for each dealer pool using historical loss experience and a dealer by dealer static pool analysis 
in addition  the decreases were also due to lower provisions needed for loan losses primarily resulting from a decrease in the percent of non accrual installment contracts receivable  which were and of gross receivables as of december  and  respectively 
provision for claims 
the amount provided for insurance and service contract claims  as a percent of total revenue  was and in and  respectively 
the increase corresponds with the increase  as a percent of total revenue  in premiums earned from in to in the company has established claims reserves on accumulated estimates of claims reported but unpaid plus estimates of incurred but unreported claims 
the company believes the reserves are adequate to cover future claims associated with the programs 
interest expense 
interest expense  as a percent of total revenue  increased from in to in total interest expense decreased from million in to million in the million decrease in interest expense for is primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of average outstanding borrowings  which resulted from i the positive cash flow generated primarily from collections on installment contracts receivable exceeding cash advances to dealers and payments of dealer holdbacks and ii million raised in july from the securitization of advance receivables 
the decrease for was partially offset by higher average interest rates during the year 
the increase in the average interest rate is primarily the result of increases in the company s eurocurrency based borrowing and facility fee margins under its credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate  due to the downgrade of the company s credit rating with moody s investor service from baa to ba  and with standard and poor s from bbb to bb effective october   and a further downgrade by moody s investor service on june  from ba to ba additionally  the increase in the average interest rate is due to increases in the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the company s note purchase agreements resulting from amendments due to the company s securitization of advance receivables 
operating income 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  operating income increased from million in to million in  a increase of million 
foreign exchange loss 
the company incurred a foreign exchange loss of  and  in and  respectively 
the losses were the result of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currency on unhedged intercompany balances between the company and subsidiaries which operate outside the united states 
provision credit for income taxes 
the provision credit for income taxes increased from million in to million in the increase is due to higher pretax profits in for  the effective tax rate was 
the company provides income taxes on its foreign earnings at the statutory rate in effect for the applicable country where such earnings arise 
the principal foreign earnings of the company arise from its operations in the united kingdom  where the statutory rate is lower than the us statutory tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue 
total revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in finance charge revenue resulting from an increase in the average installment contracts receivable balance 
the increase in gross installment contracts receivable was primarily the result of contract originations for the period exceeding the sum of collections on installment contracts and charge offs of installment contracts for the period 
the average yield on the company s portfolio  calculated using finance charge revenue divided by average net installment contracts receivable  was approximately and in and  respectively 
the increase in the average yield principally resulted from the company changing its accounting policy relating to the write off of installment contracts receivable 
the revised policy requires write off of delinquent installment contracts receivable at nine months on a recency basis compared to one year under the old policy 
this change was partially offset by an increase in the percent of non accrual installment contracts which were and of contracts as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the percent of non accrual contracts was principally due to a change in the company s non accrual policy in to days measured on a recency basis from days measured on a contractual basis  as well as a maturing of the installment contract receivable portfolio due to lower origination growth 
the company implemented the change in the non accrual policy in an effort to more quickly identify unprofitable dealer relationships 
also contributing to the increase in total revenue was vehicle service contract fees and other income which increased as a percent of total revenue from in to in this increase was primarily due to fees earned from the sale of third party service contract and credit life products offered by dealers  which increased from million in to million in  and an increase in interest earned on floor plan financing which resulted from increased floor plan balances in earned dealer enrollment fees increased  as a percent of total revenue  from in to in this increase was due to the continued increase in the number of new dealers enrolling in the company s financing program  particularly during  as these fees are deferred and amortized over the estimated repayment term of the outstanding dealer advance 
premiums earned decreased  as a percent of total revenue  from in to in this decrease was primarily the result of decreases  as a percent of total revenue  in premiums reinsured under the company s service contract and credit life insurance programs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased from in to in operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages  general and administrative  and sales and marketing 
the increase for the period was due in part to an increase in salaries and wages expense 
salaries and wages increased due to increases in employee headcount  particularly collection personnel added to service the company s larger installment contract portfolio 
to a lesser extent  the increase is due to increases in the company s average wage rates 
a portion of management personnel compensation paid by the company is charged to a company controlled by the company s chairman the affiliated company  based upon the percentage of time spent working for the affiliated company 
the company charged the affiliated company approximately  and  in and  respectively 
shared employees devote between and of their time to the company  depending on their responsibilities 
the company believes that the amounts charged by the company are representative of the respective employees activities 
in addition  the increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in general and administrative expenses 
these expenses were higher in primarily due to i an increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from the addition of new computer systems which became operational in and ii an increase in legal expenses resulting from the increase in the frequency and severity of litigation in in addition  this increase was due to the  write off of computer software in no longer used in the company s operations 
to a lesser extent  the increase in the operating expense was due to an increase in the sales and marketing expenses 
the increase corresponds with the increase in earned dealer enrollment fees  as the sales commissions paid for dealer enrollments are deferred and amortized to expense over the estimated repayment term of the outstanding dealer advance 
in addition  the increase was also the result of increases in advertising and other promotions in provision for credit losses 
the amount provided for credit losses  as a percent of total revenue  increased from in to in this increase was primarily the result of a charge recorded to reflect the enhancements in the company s methodology for estimating its reserve for advances made possible by a new loan servicing system implemented by the company 
utilizing the new information made available upon the successful implementation of this new system  the company undertook an extensive review of its exposure related to dealer advances using a static pool analysis on a per dealer basis 
in order to reflect the impact of this analysis on the company s advance reserve additional provisions were recorded in provision for claims 
the amount provided for insurance and service contract claims  as a percent of total revenue  decreased from in to in this decrease corresponds with decreases  as a percent of total revenue  in premiums earned from in to in the company has established claims reserves based on accumulated estimates of claims reported but unpaid  plus estimates of incurred but unreported claims 
the company believes the reserves are adequate to cover future claims associated with the programs 
interest expense 
interest expense  as a percent of total revenue  increased from in to in this increase was a result of an increase in the amount of average outstanding borrowings 
to a lesser extent  interest expense increased due to a higher average interest rate 
the increase in the average interest rate is primarily the result of the sale of million in senior notes  at a fixed rate of interest  in march the increase was also attributable to the downgrade of the company s credit rating with moody s investor service from baa to ba and with standard and poor s from bbb to bb effective october  as a result of these downgrades  the company s eurocurrency based borrowing margins under the million credit agreement were increased from basis points to basis points in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 
operating income 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  operating income decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or 
foreign exchange gain loss 
the company incurred a foreign exchange gain of  in and a foreign exchange loss of  in the gain and loss were the result of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currency on unhedged intercompany balances between the company and subsidiaries which operate outside the united states 
provision credit for income taxes 
the provision credit for income taxes decreased from million in to million in the decrease was due to lower pretax profits in credit loss policy and experience when an installment contract is originated  the company generally pays a cash advance to the dealer 
these advance balances represent the company s primary risk of loss related to the funding activity with the dealers 
the company maintains a reserve against advances to dealers that are not expected to be recovered through collections on the related contract portfolio 
for purposes of establishing the reserve  future collections are reduced to present value in order to achieve a level yield over the remaining term of the advance equal to the expected yield at the origination of the impaired advance 
during  the company implemented a new loan servicing system which allows the company to better estimate future collections for each dealer pool using historical loss experience and a dealer by dealer static pool analysis 
the company took a non cash charge during to reflect the impact of this enhancement in the company s methodology for estimating the advance reserve 
future reserve requirements will depend in part on the magnitude of the variance between management s prediction of future collections and the actual collections that are realized 
ultimate losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of provision  which is a current expense  may be either greater or less than actual charge offs 
the company charges off dealer advances against the reserve at such time and to the extent that the company s static pool analysis determines that the advance is completely or partially impaired 
the company also maintains an allowance for credit losses which  in the opinion of management  adequately reserves against expected future losses in the portfolio of receivables 
the risk of loss to the company related to the installment contracts receivable balances relates primarily to the earned but unpaid servicing fee or finance charge recognized on contractually delinquent accounts 
servicing fees  which are booked as finance charges  are recognized under the interest method of accounting until the underlying obligation is days past due on a recency basis 
at such time  the company suspends the accrual of revenue and makes a provision for credit losses equal to the earned but unpaid revenue 
in all cases  contracts on which no material payment has been received for nine months are charged off against dealer holdbacks  unearned finance charges and the allowance for credit losses 
during the third quarter of  the company changed its non accrual policy from days on a contractual basis to days on a recency basis and  during the fourth quarter of  changed its charge off policy to nine months on a recency basis from one year 
the company believes these changes will allow for earlier identification of underperforming dealer pools 
the following table sets forth information relating to charge offs  the allowance for credit losses  the reserve on advances  and dealer holdbacks 
and charge offs are based on nine month recency method  charge offs are based on one year recency method 
dollars in thousands for the years ended december  provision for credit losses installment contracts    provision for credit losses advances    charged against dealer holdbacks    charged against unearned finance charges    charged against allowance for credit losses    total contracts charged off    net charge off against the reserve on advances   as of december  credit ratios allowance for credit losses as a percent of gross installment contracts receivable reserve on advances as a percent of advances gross dealer holdbacks as a percent of gross installment contracts receivable liquidity and capital resources the company s principal need for capital is to fund cash advances made to dealers in connection with the acceptance of installment contracts and for the payment of dealer holdbacks to dealers who have repaid their advance balances 
these cash outflows to dealers decreased from million in to million in these amounts have historically been funded from cash collections on installment contracts  cash provided by operating activities and draws under the company s credit agreements 
during  the company paid down approximately million on its credit agreements and repaid million on its outstanding senior notes 
the positive cash flow during is primarily a result of collections on installment contracts receivable exceeding cash advances to dealers and payments of dealer holdbacks 
in addition  the company raised approximately million through the securitization of dealer advances during the third quarter of to a lesser extent  the positive cash flow is a result of refunds received from the overpayment of us federal income taxes 
during the fourth quarter of and in  the company implemented more conservative advance programs and reduced business with marginally profitable and unprofitable dealers in order to improve the performance of its portfolio of installment contracts 
these changes have resulted in reduced levels of originations and cash advances to dealers in the fourth quarter of and in  a trend which is expected to continue in future periods 
to the extent that this trend continues  the company could continue to experience a decrease in its need for capital in future periods 
the company has a million credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate 
the facility has a commitment period through june  and is subject to annual extensions for additional one year periods at the request of the company with the consent of each of the banks in the facility 
the agreement provides that interest is payable at the eurocurrency rate plus basis points  or at the prime rate 
the eurocurrency borrowings may be fixed for periods up to six months 
the credit agreement has certain restrictive covenants  including limits on the ratio of the company s debt to equity  debt to advances  debt to gross installment contracts receivable  advances to installment contracts receivable  fixed charges to net income  limits on the company s investment in its foreign subsidiaries and requirements that the company maintain a specified minimum level of net worth 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured through a lien on most of the company s assets on an equal and ratable basis with the company s senior notes 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding under this facility 
in july   the company completed a million securitization of advance receivables 
pursuant to this transaction  the company contributed dealer advances having a carrying amount of approximately million and received approximately million in financing from an institutional investor 
the financing  which is nonrecourse to the company  bears interest at a floating rate equal to the thirty day commercial paper rate plus with a maximum of and is anticipated to fully amortize within thirty months 
the company receives a monthly servicing fee equal to of the collections of the contributed installment contracts receivable 
except for the servicing fee  the company will not receive any portion of collections on the installment contracts receivable until the underlying indebtedness has been repaid in full 
the proceeds of the securitization were used to reduce indebtedness under the company s credit agreement 
when borrowing to fund the operations of its foreign subsidiaries  the company s policy is to borrow funds denominated in the currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates  thus mitigating the company s exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company maintains a significant dealer holdback on installment contracts accepted which assists the company in funding its long term cash flow requirements 
as the company s million credit facility expires on june   the company will be required to renew the facility or refinance any amounts outstanding under this facility on or before such date 
as of march   there was approximately million outstanding under this facility 
in addition  in  the company will have million of principal maturing on its senior notes and million maturing on a mortgage loan 
the company believes that the million credit facility will be renewed with similar terms and a similar commitment amount and that the mortgage loan will be refinanced 
pending the appeal of the missouri litigation  the company may be required to post a bond or letter of credit  which would reduce availability under the company s credit agreement 
based upon anticipated cash flows  management believes that amounts available under its credit agreement  cash flow from operations and various financing alternatives available will provide sufficient financing for current debt maturities and for future operations 
failure to complete the refinancing or failure to obtain other financing alternatives may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
market risk the market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially due to changes in the company s product and debt mix and developments in the financial markets 
the company is exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that it takes the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on the company s financial position and operating performance 
interest rate risk 
the company requires substantial amounts of cash to fund cash advances to dealers in connection with the acceptance of installment contracts 
the company relies on various sources of financing to assist in funding its operations  some of which is at floating rates of interest and exposes the company to risks associated with increases in interest rates 
the company manages such risk by converting portions of its floating rate debt to long term fixed rates on a periodic basis  as deemed necessary 
as of december   the company had million of floating rate debt outstanding 
for every increase in interest rates  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates 
foreign currency risk 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the possibility of changes in foreign exchange rates that could have a negative impact on earnings or asset and liability values from operations in foreign countries 
the company s most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the united kingdom 
it is the company s policy to borrow and lend in local currencies to mitigate such risks 
for an immediate  hypothetical decrease in quoted foreign currency exchange rates  annual after tax earnings would have declined by approximately  at december  the potential loss in net asset values from such a decrease would be approximately million as of december  immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates discussed in the proceeding paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios  used to calibrate risk  and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
year update the year issue is the result of computer programs and microprocessors using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year the year issue 
such programs or microprocessors may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations 
if the company or third parties with which it has a significant relationship fail to make necessary modifications  conversions and contingency plans on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  the effect cannot be quantified at this time because the company cannot accurately estimate the magnitude  duration or ultimate impact of noncompliance by its systems or those of vendors and other third parties 
the company believes that its competitors face a similar risk 
although the risk is not presently quantifiable  the following disclosure is intended to summarize the company s actions to minimize its risk from the year issue 
programs that will operate in the year unaffected by the change in year from to are referred to herein as year compliant 
state of readiness 
the company employs three major computer systems in its us operations i the application and contract system acs which is used from the time a dealer faxes an application to the company until the contract is received and funded  ii the loan servicing system lss which contains all loan and payment information and is the primary source for management information reporting  and iii the collection system cs which is used by the company s collections personnel to track and service all active customer accounts 
the acs and lss went into production in and were developed by the company in oracle and oracle forms which are year compliant 
the cs is a third party software package which has been upgraded to be year compliant 
the company employs one major computer system in its united kingdom operations which is a third party software package 
the vendor has certified to the company that the system is year compliant 
the company has finished testing on this system as well as all other mission critical systems to ensure year compliance 
all non mission critical systems are anticipated to be year compliant by june  the company has completed a comprehensive inventory of all other computer hardware  software  third party vendors and other non information technology systems 
all items identified were prioritized and assigned to a responsible party to investigate and ensure that the item becomes year compliant by the end of while modifications and testing of all mission critical and non mission critical systems is substantially complete  these systems will undergo additional testing in costs 
the company expects that all software installations or other modifications will be expensed as incurred  while the cost for new software will be capitalized and amortized over the software s useful life 
at this time  the company anticipates spending no more than  in its efforts to become year compliant  of which approximately  has been spent to date 
estimates of time  cost and risks are based on currently available information 
developments that could affect estimates include  without limitation  the availability of trained personnel  the ability to locate and correct all non compliant systems  cooperation and remediation success of third parties material to the company  and the ability to correctly anticipate risks and implement suitable contingency plans in the event of system failures at the company or third parties 
risks 
because the company expects that the systems within its control will be year compliant before the end of  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is a compliance failure by a third party upon which the company relies 
such a failure would likely have an effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the magnitude of that effect however  cannot be quantified at this time because of variables such as the type and importance of the third party  the possible effect on the company s operations and the company s ability to respond 
thus  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect on the company if such third parties do not remediate their systems in a timely manner 
in addition  it is possible that the company could experience a failure of a non mission critical system for a period of time  which could result in a minor disruption in some internal operations 
contingency plans 
contingency planning is an integral part of the company s year readiness project 
the company has and is continuing to develop contingency plans  which document the processes necessary to maintain critical business functions should a significant third party system or mission critical internal system fail 
these contingency plans generally include the repair of existing systems and  in some instances  the use of alternative systems or procedures 
the disclosure in this section contains information regarding year readiness which constitutes year readiness disclosure as defined in the year readiness disclosure act 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year update should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis contains a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of  both as amended with respect to expectations for future periods which are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  including forms k  q  and k  and include  among others  competition from traditional financing sources and from non traditional lenders  availability of funding at competitive rates of interest  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  adverse changes in economic conditions  year compliance by the company or third parties to the company  adverse changes in the automobile or finance industries or in the non prime consumer finance market  the company s ability to maintain or increase the volume of installment contracts accepted and historical collection rates and the company s ability to complete various financing alternatives
