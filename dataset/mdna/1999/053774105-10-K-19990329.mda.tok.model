item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the foremost consumer and business services companies in the world 
we were created through the december merger the cendant merger of hfs incorporated hfs and cuc international inc cuc 
we provide business services to our customers  many of which are consumer services companies  and also provide fee based services directly to consumers  generally without owning the assets or sharing the risks associated with the underlying businesses of our customers or collaborative partners 
we operate in four principal divisions travel related services  real estate related services  alliance marketing related services and other consumer and business services 
our businesses provide a wide range of complementary consumer and business services  which together represent nine business segments 
the travel related services businesses facilitate vacation timeshare exchanges  manage corporate and government vehicle fleets and franchise car rental and hotel businesses  the real estate related services businesses franchise real estate brokerage businesses  provide home buyers with mortgages and assist in employee relocation  and the alliance marketing related services businesses  provide an array of value driven products and services 
our other consumer and business services include our tax preparation services franchise  information technology services  car parking facility services  vehicle emergency support and rescue services  credit information services  financial products and other consumer related services 
as a franchisor of hotels  real estate brokerage offices  car rental operations and tax preparation services  we license the owners and operators of independent businesses to use our brand names 
we do not own or operate hotels  real estate brokerage offices  car rental operations or tax preparation offices except for certain company owned jackson hewitt offices  which we intend to franchise 
instead  we provide our franchisee customers with services designed to increase their revenue and profitability 
we have recently changed our focus from making strategic acquisitions of new businesses to maximizing the opportunities and growth potential of our existing businesses 
in connection with this change in focus  we intend to review and evaluate our existing businesses to determine whether certain businesses continue to meet our business objectives 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of such businesses  we intend from time to time to explore and conduct discussions with regard to divestitures and related corporate transactions 
however  we can give no assurance with respect to the magnitude  timing  likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction 
we also cannot predict whether any divestiture or other transactions will be consummated or  if consummated  will result in a financial or other benefit to us 
we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from future dispositions  if any  together with the proceeds of potential future debt issues and bank borrowings and cash from operations  to retire indebtedness  to repurchase our common stock commensurate with approvals from our board of directors and for other general corporate purposes 
as a result of our aforementioned change in focus  we completed the sale of two of our business segments and divested a separate subsidiary see liquidity and capital resources divestitures 
prior to the cendant merger  both hfs and cuc had grown significantly through mergers and acquisitions accounted for under both the pooling of interests method  the most significant being the merger of hfs with phh corporation phh in april the phh merger  and purchase method of accounting 
the underlying results of operations discussions are presented as if all businesses acquired in mergers and acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests have operated as one entity since inception 
results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our operating results and the operating results of certain of our underlying business segments are comprised of business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of such acquired companies have been included in our consolidated operating results and our applicable business segments from the respective dates of acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our purchase method acquisitions 
the underlying discussions of each segment s operating results focuses on adjusted ebitda  which is defined as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for other charges which are of a non recurring or unusual nature  and are not included in assessing segment performance or are not segment specific 
our management believes such discussion is the most informative representation of how management evaluates performance 
we have determined that we have nine reportable operating segments based primarily on the types of services we provide  the consumer base to which marketing efforts are directed and the methods we use to sell services 
for additional information  including a description of the services provided in each of our reportable operating segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements

also contributing to the revenue growth are increased product sales and service fees which are offered and provided to individual members 
the reduction in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin is a direct result of a million increase in membership solicitation costs 
we increased our marketing efforts during to solicit new members and as a result increased our gross average annual membership base by approximately million members at december   compared to the prior year 
the growth in members during resulted in increased servicing costs during of approximately million 
while the costs of soliciting and acquiring new members were expensed in  the revenue associated with these new members will not begin to be recognized until  upon expiration of the membership period

the fleet leasing revenue increase is due to a increase in pricing and a increase in the number of vehicles leased  while the service fee revenue increase is the result of a increase in number of fuel cards and vehicle maintenance cards partially offset by a decline in pricing

such election will subject us to certain restrictions  including restrictions on making dividend payments on our common stock until all such payments in arrears are settled 
on march   we reached a final agreement to settle a class action lawsuit that was brought on behalf of the holders of prides securities who purchased their securities on or prior to april  we originally announced a preliminary agreement in principle to settle such lawsuit on january  the final agreement maintained the basic structure and accounting treatment as the preliminary agreement 
under the terms of the final agreement  only holders who owned prides at the close of business on april  will be eligible to receive a new additional right for each prides security held 
at any time during the life of the rights expires february  holders may i sell them or ii exercise them by delivering to us three rights together with two prides in exchange for two new prides the new prides 
the terms of the new prides will be the same as the original prides except that the conversion rate will be revised so that  at the time the rights are distributed  each new prides will have a value equal to more than each original prides  or  in the aggregate  approximately million 
the settlement resulted in a net increase to shareholders equity of million 
the final agreement also requires us to offer to sell four million additional prides having identical terms to currently outstanding prides additional prides to holders of rights for cash  at a value which will be based on the valuation model that was utilized to set the conversion rate of the new prides 
based on that valuation model  the currently outstanding prides have a theoretical value of  based on the closing price of our common stock of per share on march  the offering of additional prides will be made only pursuant to a prospectus filed with the sec 
we currently expect to use the proceeds of such an offering to repurchase our common stock and for other general corporate purposes 
the arrangement to offer additional prides is designed to enhance the trading value of the rights by removing up to six million rights from circulation via exchanges associated with the offering and to enhance the open market liquidity of new prides by creating four million new prides via exchanges associated with the offering 
if holders of rights do not acquire all such prides  they will be offered to the public 
under the settlement agreement  we also agreed to file a shelf registration statement for an additional million prides  which could be issued by us at any time for cash 
however  during the last days prior to the expiration of the rights in february  we will be required to make these additional prides available to holders of rights at a price in cash equal to of the theoretical value of the additional prides as of a specified date 
the prides  if issued  would have the same terms as the currently outstanding prides and could be used to exercise rights 
based on a market price of per share of our common stock on march   the effect of the issuance of the new prides will be to distribute approximately million more shares of our common stock when the mandatory purchase of our common stock associated with the prides occurs in february this represents approximately more shares of our common stock than are currently outstanding 
the rights will be distributed following final court approval of the settlement and after the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the sec covering the new prides 
it is presently expected that if the court approves the settlement and such conditions are fulfilled  the rights will be distributed in august or september this summary of the settlement does not constitute an offer to sell any securities  which will only be made by means of a prospectus after a registration statement is filed with the sec 
there can be no assurance that the court will approve the agreement or that the conditions contained in the agreement will be fulfilled

financing related to management and mortgage programs our phh subsidiary operates our mortgage  fleet and relocation services businesses as a separate public reporting entity and supports purchases of leased vehicles  originated mortgages and advances under relocation contracts primarily by issuing commercial paper and medium term notes and maintaining securitized obligations 
such financing is not classified based on contractual maturities  but rather is included in liabilities under management and mortgage programs rather than long term debt since such debt corresponds directly with high quality related assets 
phh continues to pursue opportunities to reduce its borrowing requirements by securitizing increasing amounts of its high quality assets 
additionally  we entered into a three year agreement effective may and expanded in december under which an unaffiliated buyer the buyer committed to purchase  at our option  mortgage loans originated by us on a daily basis  up to the buyer s asset limit of billion 
under the terms of this sale agreement  we retain the servicing rights on the mortgage loans sold to the buyer and provide the buyer with options to sell or securitize the mortgage loans into the secondary market 
at december   we were servicing approximately billion of mortgage loans owned by the buyer 
phh debt is issued without recourse to the parent company 
phh subsidiary expects to continue to maximize its access to global capital markets by maintaining the quality of its assets under management 
this is achieved by establishing credit standards to minimize credit risk and the potential for losses 
depending upon asset growth and financial market conditions  our phh subsidiary utilizes the united states  european and canadian commercial paper markets  as well as other cost effective short term instruments 
in addition  our phh subsidiary will continue to utilize the public and private debt markets as sources of financing 
augmenting these sources  our phh subsidiary will continue to manage outstanding debt with the potential sale or transfer of managed assets to third parties while retaining fee related servicing responsibility 
phh s aggregate borrowings at december  and were as follows in billions commercial paper medium term notes securitized obligations other phh filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  effective march   for the aggregate issuance of up to billion of medium term note debt securities 
these securities may be offered from time to time  together or separately  based on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
the proceeds will be used to finance assets phh manages for its clients and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   phh had approximately billion of medium term notes outstanding under this shelf registration statement 
securitized obligations our phh subsidiary maintains four separate financing facilities  the outstanding borrowings of which are securitized by corresponding assets under management and mortgage programs 
the collective weighted average interest rate on such facilities was at december  such securitized obligations are described below 
mortgage facility 
in december  our phh subsidiary entered into a day financing agreement to sell mortgage loans under an agreement to repurchase the agreement such mortgages 
the agreement is collateralized by the underlying mortgage loans held in safekeeping by the custodian to the agreement 
the total commitment under this agreement is million 
mortgage loans financed under this agreement at december  totaled million 
relocation facilities 
our phh subsidiary entered into a day asset securitization agreement effective december under which an unaffiliated buyer has committed to purchase an interest in the rights to payment related to certain relocation receivables of phh 
the revolving purchase commitment provides for funding up to a limit of million 
under the terms of this agreement  our phh subsidiary retains the servicing rights related to the relocation receivables 
at december   our phh subsidiary was servicing million of assets which were funded under this agreement 
our phh subsidiary also maintains an asset securitization agreement  with a separate unaffiliated buyer  which has a purchase commitment up to a limit of million 
the terms of this agreement are similar to the aforementioned facility  with phh retaining the servicing rights on the right of payment 
at december   our phh subsidiary was servicing million of assets eligible for purchase under this agreement 
fleet facilities 
in december  our phh subsidiary entered into two secured financing transactions each expiring five years from the effective agreement date through its two wholly owned subsidiaries  trac funding and trac funding ii 
secured leased assets specified beneficial interests in a trust which owns the leased vehicles and the leases totaling million and million  respectively  were contributed to the subsidiaries by phh 
loans to trac funding and trac funding ii  were funded by commercial paper conduits in the amounts of million and million  respectively  and were secured by the specified beneficial interests 
monthly loan repayments conform to the amortization of the leased vehicles with the repayment of the outstanding loan balance required at time of disposition of the vehicles 
interest on the loans is based upon the conduit commercial paper issuance cost and committed bank lines priced on a libor basis 
repayments of loans are limited to the cash flows generated from the leases represented by the specified beneficial interests 
other to provide additional financial flexibility  phh s current policy is to ensure that minimum committed facilities aggregate percent of the average amount of outstanding commercial paper 
phh maintains billion of unsecured committed credit facilities  which are backed by domestic and foreign banks 
the facilities are comprised of billion of syndicated lines of credit maturing in march and billion of syndicated lines of credit maturing in the year in addition  phh has a million revolving credit facility  which matures in december  and other uncommitted lines of credit with various financial institutions  which were unused at december  management closely evaluates not only the credit of the banks but also the terms of the various agreements to ensure ongoing availability 
the full amount of phh s committed facilities at december  was undrawn and available 
our management believes that our current policy provides adequate protection should volatility in the financial markets limit phh s access to commercial paper or medium term notes funding 
phh continuously seeks additional sources of liquidity to accommodate phh asset growth and to provide further protection from volatility in the financial markets 
in the event that the public debt market is unable to meet phh s funding needs  we believe that phh has appropriate alternative sources to provide adequate liquidity  including current and potential future securitized obligations and its billion of revolving credit facilities 
phh minimizes its exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk by effectively matching floating and fixed interest rate and maturity characteristics of funding to related assets  varying short and long term domestic and international funding sources  and securing available credit under committed banking facilities 
on july   phh entered into a supplemental indenture no 
the supplemental indenture with the first national bank of chicago  as trustee  under the senior indenture dated as of june   which formalizes phh s policy of limiting the payment of dividends and the outstanding principal balance of loans to us to of consolidated net income as defined in the supplemental indenture for each fiscal year 
the supplemental indenture prohibits phh from paying dividends or making loans to us if upon giving effect to such dividends and or loan  phh s debt to equity ratio exceeds to  at the time of the dividend or loan  as the case may be 
litigation on april   we publicly announced that we discovered accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc 
such discovery prompted investigations into such matters by us and the audit committee of our board of directors 
as a result of the findings from the investigations  we restated our previously reported financial results for  and since such announcement  more than lawsuits claiming to be class actions  two lawsuits claiming to be brought derivatively on our behalf and three individual lawsuits have been filed in various courts against us and other defendants 
with the exception of an action pending in the delaware chancery court and an action filed in the superior court of new jersey that has been dismissed  these actions were all filed in or transferred to the united states district court for the district of new jersey  where they are pending before judge william h 
walls and magistrate judge joel a 
pisano 
the court has ordered consolidation of many of the actions 
the sec and the united states attorney for the district of new jersey are conducting investigations relating to the matters referenced above 
the sec advised us that its inquiry should not be construed as an indication by the sec or its staff that any violations of law have occurred 
while we made all adjustments considered necessary as a result of the findings from the investigations in restating our financial statements  we can provide no assurances that additional adjustments will not be necessary as a result of these government investigations 
on october   an action claiming to be a class action was filed against us and four of our former officers and directors 
the complaint claims that we made false and misleading public announcements and filings with the sec in connection with our proposed acquisition of american bankers allegedly in violation of section b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and that the plaintiff and the alleged class members purchased american bankers securities in reliance on these public announcements and filings at inflated prices 
as previously disclosed  we reached an agreement with plaintiffs counsel representing the class of holders of our prides securities who purchased their securities on or prior to april  to settle their class action lawsuit against us through the issuance of a new right for each prides security held 
see liquidity and capital resources feline prides and trust preferred securities for a more detailed description of the settlement 
other than the prides class action litigation  we do not believe that it is feasible to predict or determine the final outcome of these proceedings or investigations or to estimate the amounts or potential range of loss with respect to these proceedings or investigations 
the possible outcomes or resolutions of the proceedings could include a judgment against us or settlements and could require substantial payments by us 
in addition  the timing of the final resolution of the proceedings or investigations is uncertain 
we believe that material adverse outcomes with respect to such proceedings or investigations could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
credit ratings in october  duff phelps credit rating co 
dcr  standard poor s corporation s p  and moody s investors service inc moody s reduced our long term debt credit rating to a from a  bbb from a  and baa from a  respectively 
in october  moody s and s p reduced phh s long term and short term debt ratings to a p and a a from a p and a a  respectively 
phh s long term and short term credit ratings remain a f and a d with fitch ibca and dcr  respectively 
while the recent downgrading caused us to incur an increase in cost of funds  we believe our sources of liquidity continue to be adequate 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
repricing of stock options on september   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved a program to effectively reprice certain company stock options granted to our middle management during december and the first quarter of such options were effectively repriced on october  at per share the new price  which was the fair market value as defined in the option plans on the date of such repricing 
on september   the compensation committee also modified the terms of certain options held by certain of our executive officers and senior managers subject to certain conditions including revocation of a portion of existing options 
additionally  a management equity ownership program was adopted that requires these executive officers and senior managers to acquire our common stock at various levels commensurate with their respective compensation levels 
the option modifications were accomplished by canceling existing options and issuing a lesser amount of new options at the new price and  with respect to certain options of executive officers and senior managers  at prices above the new price 
share repurchase program we have completed the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to a billion repurchase program  authorized by our board of directors in october during the first quarter of  our board of directors authorized an additional million to be repurchased under such program 
we continue to execute this program through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions  subject to bank credit facility covenants and certain rating agency constraints 
as of march   we had repurchased a total of billion of our common stock  reducing our outstanding shares by million shares 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares costing million 
cash flows vs 
we generated million of cash flows from operations in representing a million decrease from the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily due to a million net increase in mortgage loans held for sale due to increased mortgage loan origination volume 
we used billion of cash flows for investing activities in  principally consisting of a billion net investment in assets under management and mortgage programs and billion of acquisitions and acquisition related payments  which included the acquisitions of npc and jackson hewitt 
in  we used billion for investing activities including a billion net investment in assets under management and mortgage programs and million of acquisitions and acquisition related payments 
in  cash flows from financing activities of approximately billion included billion of proceeds from public offerings of senior debt  billion of term loan borrowings and billion of proceeds from the issuance of feline prides and trust preferred securities 
gross cash flows from financing activities were partially offset by billion of term loan repayments  million of our common stock purchases  and principal repayments of million and million pertaining to the outstanding senior notes and the notes  respectively 
additionally  in management and mortgage program financing consisted of billion of net borrowings which funded our investments in assets under management and mortgage programs 
in  cash flows from financing activities of million primarily consisted of net borrowings totaling million including net proceeds of million from the issuance of the convertible subordinated notes in february and million of net borrowings which funded purchases of assets under management and mortgage programs 
capital expenditures in  million was invested in property and equipment to support operational growth and enhance marketing opportunities 
in addition  technological improvements were made to improve operating efficiencies 
capital spending in included the development of integrated business systems within the relocation segment as well as investments in systems and office expansion to support growth in the mortgage segment 
we expect to reduce our level of capital spending by approximately in year compliance the following disclosure also constitutes a year readiness disclosure statement pursuant to the year readiness and disclosure act 
the year presents the risk that information systems will be unable to recognize and process date sensitive information properly from and after january  to minimize or eliminate the effect of the year risk on our business systems and applications  we are continually identifying  evaluating  implementing and testing changes to our computer systems  applications and software necessary to achieve year compliance 
we implemented a year initiative in march that has now been adopted by all of our business units 
as part of such initiative  we have selected a team of managers to identify  evaluate and implement a plan to bring all of our critical business systems and applications into year compliance prior to december  the year initiative consists of four phases i identification of all critical business systems subject to year risk the identification phase  ii assessment of such business systems and applications to determine the method of correcting any year problems the assessment phase  iii implementing the corrective measures the implementation phase  and iv testing and maintaining system compliance the testing phase 
we have substantially completed the identification and assessment phases and have identified and assessed five areas of risk i internally developed business applications  ii third party vendor software  such as business applications  operating systems and special function software  iii computer hardware components  iv electronic data transfer systems between us and our customers  and v embedded systems  such as phone switches  check writers and alarm systems 
although no assurances can be made  we believe that we have identified substantially all of our systems  applications and related software that are subject to year compliance risk and have either implemented or initiated the implementation of a plan to correct such systems that are not year compliant 
in addition  as part of our assessment process we are developing contingency plans as necessary 
substantially all of our mission critical systems have been remediated during however  we cannot directly control the timing of certain vendor products and in certain situations  exceptions have been authorized 
we are closely monitoring those situations and intend to complete testing efforts and any contingency implementation efforts prior to december  although we have begun the testing phase  we do not anticipate completion of the testing phase until sometime prior to december we rely on third party service providers for services such as telecommunications  internet service  utilities  components for our embedded and other systems and other key services 
interruption of those services due to year issues could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have initiated an evaluation of the status of such third party service providers efforts to determine alternative and contingency requirements 
while approaches to reducing risks of interruption of business operations vary by business unit  options include identification of alternative service providers available to provide such services if a service provider fails to become year compliant within an acceptable timeframe prior to december  the total cost of our year compliance plan is anticipated to be million 
approximately million of these costs had been incurred through december   and we expect to incur the balance of such costs to complete the compliance plan 
we have been expensing and capitalizing the costs to complete the compliance plan in accordance with appropriate accounting policies 
variations from anticipated expenditures and the effect on our future results of operations are not anticipated to be material in any given year 
however  if year modifications and conversions are not made including modifications by our third party service providers  or are not completed in time  the year problem could have a material impact on our operations  cash flows and financial condition 
at this time we believe the most likely worst case scenario involves potential disruptions in our operations as a result of the failure of services provided by third parties 
the estimates and conclusions herein are forward looking statements and are based on our best estimates of future events 
risks of completing the plan include the availability of resources  the ability to discover and correct the potential year sensitive problems which could have a serious impact on certain operations and the ability of our service providers to bring their systems into year compliance 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

if the derivative does qualify as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss on the change in the derivative fair values will either be recognized i in earnings as offsets to the changes in the fair value of the related item being hedged or ii be deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period during which the hedged transactions occur 
we have not yet determined what impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no

subsequent accounting that results from implementing sfas no 
shall be accounted for in accordance with sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in recurring operations  we must deal with effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the following discussion presents an overview of how such changes are managed and a view of their potential effects 
we use various financial instruments  particularly interest rate and currency swaps and currency forwards  to manage our respective interest rate and currency risks 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
established practices require that derivative financial instruments relate to specific asset  liability or equity transactions or to currency exposures 
more detailed information about these financial instruments  as well as the strategies and policies for their use  is provided in notes and to the financial statements 
the sec requires that registrants include information about potential effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange in their financial statements 
although the rules offer alternatives for presenting this information  none of the alternatives is without limitations 
the following discussion is based on so called shock tests  which model effects of interest rate and currency shifts on the reporting company 
shock tests  while probably the most meaningful analysis permitted  are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and by their inability to include the extraordinarily complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
while the following results of shock tests for interest rate and currencies may have some limited use as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts 
o one means of assessing exposure to interest rate changes is a duration based analysis that measures the potential loss in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical change decrease in interest rates across all maturities sometimes referred to as a parallel shift in the yield curve 
under this model  it is estimated that  all else constant  such a decrease would not adversely impact our net earnings based on year end positions 
o one means of assessing exposure to changes in currency exchange rates is to model effects on future earnings using a sensitivity analysis 
year end consolidated currency exposures  including financial instruments designated and effective as hedges  were analyzed to identify our assets and liabilities denominated in other than their relevant functional currency 
net unhedged exposures in each currency were then remeasured assuming a change decrease in currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
under this model  it is estimated that  all else constant  such a decrease would not adversely impact our net earnings based on year end positions 
the categories of primary market risk exposure to us are i long term us interest rates due to mortgage loan origination commitments and an investment in mortgage loans held for resale  ii short term interest rates as they impact vehicle and relocation receivables  and iii libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings
