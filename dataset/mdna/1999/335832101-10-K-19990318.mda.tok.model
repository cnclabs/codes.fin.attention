in connection with the following discussion  see the financial data in item and cautionary factors in item of this document regarding forward looking statements and factors that could impact the business and financial prospects of the company 
balance sheet analysis liquidity 
the company s primary sources of funds are deposits retail and wholesale  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans  advances from the federal home loan bank the fhlb of chicago  and  to a lesser extent  maturities of investment securities and short term investments  sales of loans  repurchase agreements  and operations 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are influenced to a great extent by interest rates  general economic conditions  and competition 
federal regulations historically have required first northern to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets such as cash  certain time deposits  us government and agency securities  and other obligations generally having remaining maturities of less than five years 
liquidity requirements have varied from time to time based upon economic conditions and deposit flows 
the current requirement is of the preceding calendar month s average net withdrawable deposits and borrowings payable on demand or in one year or less liquidity base or of the average daily balance of the liquidity base during the preceding quarter 
the company s total liquidity ratio at december  was and at december  the liquidity ratio decreased at year end as compared to year end as a result of funding loan originations 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term responsibility of management 
the company adjusts its investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of i expected loan demand  ii expected deposit flows  iii yields available on interest earning deposits  and iv the objectives of its asset liability management program 
excess liquidity is generally invested in interest earning overnight deposits and short to intermediate term us government and agency obligations 
if the savings bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them from operations  it can borrow from the fhlb of chicago see borrowings 
investment and mortgage related securities 
a substantial portion of the company s investment securities approximately million at december  and million at december  are held and managed by fnii 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note b and note c securities available for sale and securities held to maturity 
interest earning deposits increased  in as a result of placing excess funds in overnight deposits until the funds usually a day are needed 
the dollar amount of both the securities available for sale and securities held to maturity increased in as compared to as a result of reinvesting interest earned on the investment portfolio into additional securities and the purchasing of additional securities 
lending activities 
first northern has traditionally concentrated on the origination of adjustable and fixed interest rate one to four family mortgage loans and consumer loans throughout its offices 
first northern also originates construction  more than four family multi family residential and commercial real estate loans 
in addition  the savings bank will purchase one to four family and multi family mortgage loans from other sources primarily within the state of wisconsin 
adjustable interest rate mortgage loans are originated for first northern s portfolio while fixed interest rate mortgage loans  particularly those with terms greater than years  are primarily originated for sale in the secondary mortgage market 
first northern retains and year fixed interest rate mortgage loan originations in its portfolio 
at december   approximately of first northern s mortgage loan portfolio was interest rate adjustable as compared to at december  first northern originates a variety of adjustable and fixed interest rate mortgage loan products based upon market demands and general economic conditions 
adjustable indexed interest rate mortgage loans at december   contain an interest rate adjustment provision tied to the national monthly median cost of funds ratio for savings association insurance fund saif insured institutions  plus an additional mark up of to the index which varies with the mortgage loan product 
interest rates on indexed mortgage loans are adjusted  up or down  on predetermined dates fixed by contract  in relation to and based on the index or market interest rates 
in  first northern adjusted interest rates on indexed mortgage loans downward at or before the contractual interest rate adjustment date in response to decreasing market interest rates 
if the adjustable indexed mortgage loans interest rates had not been decreased  these mortgage loans would have refinanced to a fixed interest rate mortgage loan or another indexed mortgage loan at a lesser interest rate 
in  first northern decreased interest rates on approximately million of its mortgage loans 
adjustable indexed interest rate mortgage loans have an initial period  ranging from one to five years  during which the interest rate is fixed  with adjustments permitted thereafter  subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps which vary with the product 
annual limits on interest rate increases are to  while aggregate lifetime interest rate increases over the term of the loan are currently at above the original mortgage loan interest rate 
first northern s origination of second mortgage loans  automobile  boat  recreational vehicle and other types of consumer loans  which are generally of shorter maturities than first mortgage loans  enhances the matching of maturities of its assets and liabilities and offer a higher yield 
second mortgage loans are offered on both a fixed and adjustable interest rate basis  other consumer loans are generally offered on a fixed interest rate basis 
at december  and  approximately of first northern s consumer loan portfolio was interest rate adjustable 
the following table sets forth first northern s mortgage and consumer loan originations and purchases loan originations and purchases during the year ended december in thousands mortgage loans originated and purchased construction residential   construction commercial real estate  loans on existing property   refinancing   other loans   total mortgage loans originated and purchased   consumer loans originated and purchased consumer   second mortgage   automobile   education   total consumer loans originated and purchased   total loans originated and purchased   the dollar volume of first northern s mortgage loan originations and purchases substantially increased in as compared to primarily as a result of favorable market interest rates which fostered home purchases  new home construction and refinancing of existing mortgage loans 
in addition  first northern continued to purchase mortgage loans in primarily from other wisconsin financial institutions 
in  first northern purchased million of one to four family residential loans  million of multi family loans and million of commercial real estate loans as compared to million of one to four family residential  million of multi family and million of commercial real estate loans in first northern purchases loans when interest rates on these loans provide an opportunity to incrementally add to the profitability of the company 
first northern s growth in the dollar amount of mortgage loans outstanding was million or for as compared to million or in the increase in the mortgage loan portfolio was the result of the substantial increase of mortgage loan originations 
in  first northern re evaluated its asset and liability management strategy interest rate risk and increased its percentage of fixed interest rate mortgage loans in its mortgage portfolio from approximately to approximately 
this increase was implemented after a review of its asset and liability gap position see asset and liability management and other investment opportunities in the market 
at december   first northern had approximately million fixed interest rate mortgage loans in its mortgage loan portfolio  compared to approximately million of fixed interest rate mortgage loans at december  in  first northern sold million of fixed interest rate mortgage loans as compared to million in this increase was the result of the origination and subsequent sale of year fixed interest rate mortgage loans 
the consumer loan portfolio at december   increased million as compared to december  as a result of increased consumer loan originations and purchases 
the moderate increase in consumer loan originations of million was the result of customers and individuals consolidating their consumer loan needs into the refinancing of their mortgage loan and a slight decrease in the dollar amount of loan purchases from sfc 
in  first northern and fnii purchased million of automobile loans from sfc as compared to million in this decrease in purchases from sfc was the result of additional competition in the indirect automobile loan market 
sfc originates indirect automobile loans in the state of wisconsin and sells these loans to the savings bank or fnii and the other sfc shareholder while retaining the servicing of such loans 
the book value of first northern s investment in sfc as of december  was  asset quality 
first northern currently classifies any loan on which a payment is days or more past due as non performing 
the following table summarizes non performing loans and assets non performing loans and assets at december dollars in thousands non accrual mortgage loans non accrual consumer loans total non performing loans properties subject to foreclosure foreclosed properties and repossessed assets total non performing assets non performing loans as a percent of total loans 

non performing assets as a percent of total assets 

total non performing loans and assets decreased in as compared to as a result of the overall stable economy in first northern s market areas and management s continued emphasis to maintain non performing assets at low levels 
management believes non performing loans and assets at the end of remain significantly below state and national averages 
management also believes that allowances for losses on loans  real estate owned and repossessed assets are adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  real estate owned and repossessed assets  future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions or regulatory requirements 
a summary of the general loan loss allowances is shown below general loan loss allowances at or for the year ended december dollars in thousands balance at the beginning of the year    provisions charge offs recoveries balance at the end of the year    allowance as a percent of total loans 


allowance as a percent of non performing loans  allowance as a percent of total assets 


allowance as a percent of non performing assets life insurance policies 
life insurance policies or bank owned life insurance boli increased million in primarily as a result of the increased value 
boli is long term life insurance on the lives of certain current and past savings bank employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by the savings bank 
the cash value accumulation on boli is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the participant s death 
management believes this is an effective method to help offset a portion of future employee benefit costs 
deposits 
deposits increased a record million or in as compared to million or in as of december   deposits totaled million or of total liabilities 
this record deposit growth was the result of various factors including the following i many stock market investors deposited money into first northern deposit accounts as a safe haven for their funds during the stock market turmoil  ii northeastern wisconsin continuing to have good economic growth which has created new customers and hence new first northern deposits  and iii the utilization of wholesale and jumbo deposits 
competition for deposits in first northern s market area has been and will continue to be very strong 
first northern establishes savings deposit interest rates to be competitive in each market area and to maintain a favorable interest rate spread 
the deposit philosophy continues to be that an increase in deposit dollars will be sought only if the increase is incrementally profitable 
due to loan demand and competition for retail deposits  first northern will continue to seek alternative sources of funding  including wholesale and jumbo  or more deposits 
at december   first northern had a total of million of wholesale brokered  corporate and municipal jumbo deposits as compared to million at the end of jumbo and wholesale deposits accounted for of the deposit increase for and were obtained at a lower cost than retail deposits 
this strategy of acquiring wholesale and jumbo deposits will be an integral part of the savings bank s deposit acquisition strategy for first northern believes that the household checking account is the basic account upon which further customer banking relationships can be developed 
first northern utilized aggressive pricing and marketing of the checking account and has been able to become the primary financial institution for many households 
first northern will continue to emphasize checking accounts and services in to enhance this checking account relationship and to increase non interest fee income  first northern expanded its first northern checkcard base 
the first northern checkcard offers a checking account customer the opportunity to access a checking account anywhere in the world where visa is accepted 
first northern aggressively marketed the first northern checkcard in and and as a result of this aggressive marketing philosophy  the checkcard has gained greater customer acceptance and increased product profitability 
the taxpayers relief act of continues to offers investors and homeowners significant tax planning opportunities ranging from income tax savings  estate tax savings  lower capital gains rates  retirement and education benefits  and the elimination of certain taxes altogether 
first northern had anticipated at the beginning of  that the new roth and education individual retirement account would result in higher deposit growth 
first northern did not experience a significant deposit growth in these new retirement accounts in additional educational efforts will be made to communicate the advantages of the roth and education individual retirement account to existing and potential customers 
first northern s objective is to create a one stop family financial banking center by offering a wide selection of checking accounts  short  intermediate and long term certificates of deposit  insured retirement accounts and mortgage and consumer loans to meet a wide variety of customer needs 
the gnfsc investment center  established in april   posted a fourth year of profitability 
profits for were less than as a result of adding an additional salesperson to the staff in the investment center offers non insured deposit products  such as tax deferred annuities and  through a network agreement with a registered broker dealer  stocks  mutual funds and brokerage products 
the establishment of this division has resulted in increased customer retention and new customer relationships through the existing savings bank s branch network 
borrowings 
borrowings  primarily from the fhlb of chicago  decreased million at december   as compared to december   as a result of the savings bank s ability to increase deposits  the increased loan sales and moderate loan growth 
the borrowings have maturities ranging from overnight to approximately nine years see notes to consolidated financial statements note g borrowings 
management anticipates it will continue to utilize borrowings to fund its growth in interest earning assets in stockholders equity 
first northern s stockholders equity to total assets ratio at december   was  as compared to at december  first northern employs methods which are intended to increase interest earning assets and thus reduce the percentage of equity to total assets known as leveraging 
in addition to interest earning asset growth  the company has also repurchased its stock 
the first stock repurchase program  which began in march of and was completed in september  resulted in the repurchase of  shares at an average cost of per share 
a second stock repurchase program which began in october authorized the repurchase of  shares 
the second stock repurchase program repurchased  shares at an average cost of per share before it expired in october a third stock repurchase program was implemented in march of which authorized the repurchase of up to  shares 
at december    shares at an average cost of per share has been repurchased in the third stock repurchase program 
first northern may implement additional stock repurchase programs in the future if it is economically prudent 
the wisconsin department of financial institutions division of savings institutions  which regulates the savings bank  requires maintenance of a minimum of six percent equity to total assets 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision ots capital rules require the savings bank to meet three separate standards i a leverage limit of core capital to adjusted total assets of not less than three percent  ii tangible capital to adjusted total assets of not less than one and one half percent  and iii risk based capital to risk weighted assets of eight percent 
the savings bank meets and exceeds all regulatory capital standards see notes to consolidated financial statements note i stockholders equity 
asset and liability management the primary function of asset and liability management is to provide liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk is the imbalance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at a given maturity or repricing date and is commonly referred to as the interest rate gap the gap 
a positive gap exists when there are more assets than liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
a negative gap occurs when there are more liabilities than assets maturing or repricing within the same time frame 
the following chart reflects first northern s gap position as of december  cumulative gap position dollars in thousands months to to over or less months years years total interest earning assets mortgage loans a      consumer loans b      investment securities c     mortgage related securities d    interest earning deposits total rate sensitive assets      interest bearing liabilities passbook accounts e      now variable rate insured money market accounts e      time deposits e     advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance    borrowings      total rate sensitive liabilities      gap      cumulative gap     cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets a excludes undisbursed loan proceeds of  includes  of mortgage loans held for sale 
b includes  of education loans held for sale 
c includes  of fhlb stock  excludes unrealized gains or losses 
d excludes unrealized gains or losses 
e does not include accrued interest which totals  for all deposits 
the calculation of a gap position is subjective by nature and requires management to make a number of assumptions as to when an asset or liability will reprice or mature 
assumptions used in estimating the maturity repricing amounts and dates of the more significant asset and liability categories include i investment securities based upon contractual maturities and if applicable  call dates  ii loans based upon contractual maturities  repricing date  if applicable  scheduled repayments of principal and projected prepayments of principal based upon the company s historical experience  iii mortgage related securities based upon an average of wall street estimates for prepayment speeds  and iv deposits based upon contractual maturities and various decay rates applied to the remaining deposit dollars 
the decay rate  which varies with deposit product  is based on historical decay rates of first northern 
first northern s overall asset and liability management goal is to maximize long term profitability and returns to stockholders 
first northern s current strategy is to i originate and retain adjustable interest rate mortgage loans  ii originate and retain and year fixed interest rate mortgage loans  iii originate and sell most year fixed interest rate mortgage loans  iv originate shorter maturity consumer loans  v emphasize the origination of adjustable interest rate home equity loans  vi counsel depositors to balance their deposits between short  intermediate  and long term deposits  and vii to offer new and attractive deposits and investment opportunities 
in addition  borrowings with various terms are used to reach the targeted asset liability mix 
currently  management s strategic goal for asset liability management is to maintain a cumulative one year gap within a range of a positive to a negative 
management believes this is an appropriate level to achieve first northern s long term goals  while controlling interest rate risk 
impact of year historically  computer programs generally abbreviated dates by eliminating the century digits of the year 
many resources such as software  hardware  telephones  voicemail  heating  ventilating and air conditioning  alarms  etc 
systems are affected 
these systems were designed to assume a century value of to save memory and disk space within their programs 
in addition  many systems use a value of in a year or in a date to indicate no date or any date or even a default expiration date 
as the year approaches  this abbreviated date mechanism within systems threatens to disrupt the function of computer software at nearly every business  including first northern  which relies heavily on computer systems for account and other recordkeeping functions 
if the millennium issue is ignored  system failures or miscalculations could occur  causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
first northern outsources a majority of its mission critical computer functions to a brookfield  wisconsin based company  fiserv  inc fiserv 
because year problems could affect fiserv  and hence the savings bank through its relationship with fiserv  the savings bank has discussed potential year problems with fiserv 
these discussions have kept the savings bank abreast of fiserv s progress in anticipating and avoiding year problems that could affect first northern s operations 
fiserv has advised first northern that it has fully tested and renovated their systems for year issues 
first northern participated in client testing on october   which revealed no significant issues 
first northern will also be performing additional tests with fiserv during the first quarter of due to the interdependence of first northern s systems with other third party systems  there are risks of specific service outages if these parties do not sufficiently secure their systems from year issues 
first northern is corresponding with these vendors regarding the year status of their systems 
in addition to internal testing  where possible  coordinated year testing will take place with the third party service providers that have systems interfaced with first northern s systems 
these third parties include  but are not limited to  telephone data service providers  public utilities  the federal reserve  credit bureaus  credit card servicers  atm networks  etc 
based on recent assessments  first northern determined that it will be required to modify or replace certain portions of its internal software and hardware so that its systems will function properly with respect to dates on or after september  
it is currently anticipated that the total cost of these modifications will not exceed a total of  pre tax 
at the end of december   approximately  has been spent on new equipment  software and miscellaneous expenses for year first northern does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project  and that such costs are principally the payroll costs for its information systems group 
first northern currently believes that with these modifications  the year will not pose a significant operational problems for its systems 
if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year could have an adverse impact on the operations of first northern 
first northern has currently completed the inventory  assessment and analysis phases of its year project 
the renovation  testing and contingency planning phases are expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of at december   the renovation is approximately completed  the testing phase is approximately completed and the contingency planning phase is approximately completed 
contingency planning developing backup procedures to be used in the event of unforeseen problems is primarily focused on critical systems 
this planning not only addresses systems issues  but also operational issues such as the cash needs of its customers 
percent time year initiative complete frame inventory and assessment list all systems affected by year analysis document systems status for year compliance renovation upgrade non compliant systems to be year ready testing simulate operations with dates advanced beyond contingency planning develop backup plans for critical systems overall  first northern estimates that of the year project has been completed  as of december  first northern expects to use internal resources to reprogram  upgrade or replace and test its internal systems 
internal resources are also being used to renovate savings financial corporation sfc  a partially owned subsidiary operating in hales corner  wisconsin 
even though internal resources are being used to prepare for year causing some other non critical projects to be delayed  first northern believes there are benefits to operations through the renovations that have taken place 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications  are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those anticipated 
average balance sheet and yield rate analysis the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets  the resultant yields  and the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made since first northern does not have any tax exempt investments 
average balances are derived from average daily balances 
the yield on securities available for sale are included in investment securities and mortgage related securities and yields are calculated on the historical basis 
the yields and rates are established by dividing income or expense dollars by the average balance of the asset or liability

rate volume analysis of net interest income the interaction of changes in volume and rates earned or paid with regard to interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities has a significant impact on net income between periods 
the volume of interest earning dollars in loans and investments compared to the volume of interest bearing dollars in deposits and borrowings  combined with the interest rate spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods

net income increased  in primarily as a result of the dollar increase in interest earning assets  gains from the sales of loans and a reduction in the effective income tax rate 
interest income 
interest income on mortgage loans increased  as a result of increased dollars outstanding in the mortgage loan portfolio 
the average interest rate earned decreased as a result of i mortgage loans being originated at interest rates below the existing mortgage loan portfolio yield  ii downward interest rate adjustments to certain mortgage loans in its portfolio before their scheduled adjustment dates in response to the refinancing of existing adjustable interest rate mortgage loans  and iii the prepayments of mortgage loans with higher than market interest rates 
interest income on consumer loans increased  as a result of an increase of million of consumer loans outstanding throughout the average interest rate earned on the consumer portfolio decreased to in as compared to in as a result of i consumer loan originations at interest rates that were below the existing yield on the consumer loan portfolio  ii decreases in some of first northern s consumer loans which use the prime interest rate as an index  and iii prepayments to consumer loans that are at interest rates above market interest rates 
investment securities and interest earning deposits interest income increased  and  respectively  as a result of increased dollars outstanding 
first northern purchases investment securities when it incrementally adds to the overall profitability of the company and to aid in its interest rate risk management 
the increase in the dollar amount of interest earning deposits is the result of excess funds above the funding needs for loans and operations  being invested in short term certificates of deposits or in overnight investments 
these additional funds were created by strong deposit gains and sales of loans 
interest on mortgage related securities decreased  as a result of prepayment and repayments to the underlying collateral mortgage loans 
the average interest rate earned on mortgage related securities decreased to from primarily as the result of prepayments and repayments to higher than market interest rate securities and the purchase of mortgage related securities at lower interest rates than existing yields on the mortgage related securities portfolio 
interest expense 
interest expense on deposits increased  as a result of increased deposits 
first northern utilizes various time deposit terms and interest rates to attract new deposits and in  utilized wholesale deposits as a method to acquire less expensive deposits 
there are times when wholesale deposits are a more cost effective method to acquire funds than retail deposits or borrowings 
interest expense on borrowings increased  in primarily as a result of increased average borrowings outstanding 
first northern primarily borrows from the fhlb of chicago and anticipates that it will continue to borrow to fund its growth in interest earning assets in advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance escrow interest expense increased modestly in as a result of the increased number of escrow accounts that were interest bearing 
although the interest rate paid on escrow accounts of was the same in as it was in  and the average dollars in escrow were approximately equal  a number of non interest bearing escrow accounts were replaced by interest bearing escrow accounts thus increasing interest expense 
the escrow interest rate for is provisions for loan losses 
first northern provided an additional  to loan loss allowances in the total loan loss allowance at december   is  or 
of the total loan portfolio at december   as compared to  or 
of the total loan portfolio at december  non interest income 
fees on serviced loans decreased  primarily as the result of the amortization of the mortgage servicing asset in accordance with financial accounting standards fasb no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
as the principal of a mortgage loan which was sold with servicing retained repays or prepays  the mortgage servicing asset is reduced and netted against the fees on serviced loans  thereby reducing the income on serviced loans 
in  the amortization of the mortgage loan servicing asset amounted to  and  in deposit account service charges increased  primarily as the result of i the increased number of now checking accounts and their associated fees  and ii customer usage of checkcard 
checkcard is a debit card where each time the savings bank s checkcard is used a fee  which varies with each merchant  is paid to the savings bank by the debit card company 
the savings bank promotes the use of its debit card by direct mail 
insurance commissions decreased  primarily as a result of a reduction in the bonus received from insurance carriers 
if first northern obtains a predetermined threshold of insurance sales and insurance losses are below another threshold  insurance bonuses can be earned 
in  first northern insurance losses exceeded the threshold and the level of insurance bonuses were reduced 
gains on the sales of loans increased  as a result of increased loan sales 
loan sales in were million as compared to million in see financial condition balance sheet loans receivable 
other non interest income increased  primarily as the result of boli 
in december  first northern purchased million of life insurance to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits 
interest earned on the million of life insurance in was  non interest expense 
compensation expense increased  as a result of normal salary increases  the addition of full time equivalent employees and increased accruals for the director deferred retirement plan and supplemental executive retirement plan 
federal deposit insurance premiums increased  as a result of increased deposits and in  the receipt of a  refund of deposit insurance premiums paid from prior periods 
data processing expense increased  primarily from increased depreciation expense and service contract expense on data processing equipment 
furniture and equipment expense decreased  as a result of a number of pieces of furniture and equipment being fully depreciated at the end of telephone and postage expenses decreased  by negotiating a reduction to the cost of long distance calls and an increase in expense deferrals associated with the substantial increase in loan originations 
incremental telephone and postage expenses associated with loan originations are deferred and amortized back against interest income over the life of the loan  which results in an adjustment to the loan yield 
marketing expense increased  as a result of increased advertising and marketing of deposit and loan products 
first northern believes the growth in lending and deposit volumes is facilitated by increased marketing of those products and hence  increased costs 
other expenses increased  as a result of increased costs associated with the operations of sfc  costs associated with the issuance and operations of the debit card and an increase in bad checks and customer fraud 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for is as compared to for this decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily the result of earnings on boli for which no income tax provision is provided and the increase in earnings at fnii which is not subject to state income taxes 
both activities have reduced state franchise taxes 
comparison of years ended december  and general 
net income increased  in primarily as a result of the exclusion of the one time saif special assessment of  pre tax or  after tax and the continued growth of interest earning assets which contributed to the increase in interest income 
interest income 
interest income on mortgage loans increased  as a result of increased dollars outstanding in the mortgage loan portfolio and an increase in the average interest rate earned 
the dollar increase in the mortgage loan portfolio resulted from an increase in adjustable interest rate mortgage loan originations and purchases which first northern retains in its portfolio 
the increase in the average interest rate earned resulted primarily from interest rates being adjusted upward on existing adjustable interest rate mortgage loans to the lesser of market interest rates or the contractual allowable interest rate 
interest income on consumer loans increased  as a result of an increase of million in consumer loans outstanding throughout the average interest rate earned on the consumer loan portfolio decreased to in as compared to in as a result of consumer loan originations at interest rates below the weighted average yield on the consumer loan portfolio 
investment securities interest and interest on mortgage related securities rose  and  respectively in as a result of increased dollars outstanding 
first northern borrowed funds and reinvested those dollars into investment securities primarily agency securities and mortgage related securities 
first northern will continue to look for profit opportunities in by borrowing and reinvesting 
interest expense 
interest expense on deposits increased  as a result of increased deposits and the cost of those deposits 
competition for deposits within first northern s market is strong which has increased the cost to acquire and retain deposits 
the competition for deposits is not only from other financial institutions banks  credit unions but also from mutual funds and the stock market in general 
borrowings  primarily from the fhlb of chicago  continued to increase in thereby increasing the interest expense on borrowings 
the growth in first northern s interest earning assets outpaced its growth in deposits thereby increasing borrowings 
advance payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance escrow interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower balances in escrow accounts 
although the number of mortgage loans with escrow accounts increased in  the average balances carried in individual escrow accounts were reduced as a result of the department of housing and urban development hud regulation  which requires aggregating of tax and insurance dollars within an individual s escrow  reduction in the dollar amount of property taxes statewide result of funding schools via state revenues rather than property taxes  and a change in first northern s policy  of no longer escrowing for property insurance 
the interest rate paid on escrow accounts in was compared to in the escrow interest rate for is  the same as provision for loan losses 
first northern expensed  for loan losses in as compared to  in the total loan loss allowance is  or 
of total loan portfolio at december   as compared to  and 
respectively  at december  non interest income 
fees on serviced loans decreased in primarily as a result of statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights which amortizes a mortgage servicing asset as a reduction to fees on serviced loans over the period of and in proportion to the expected loan servicing fee revenue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk first northern s financial performance is affected by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
first northern does not use derivatives to mitigate its interest rate risk or credit risk  relying instead on loan review and an adequate loan loss reserve see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss in value due to changes in interest rates 
this risk is addressed by first northern s asset liability management committee alco  which includes senior management representatives 
the alco monitors and considers methods of managing interest rate risk by monitoring changes in net portfolio value npv and in gap position see management s discussion and analysis asset and liability management 
the alco attempts to manage the various components of first northern s balance sheet to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on net interest income 
first northern s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine first northern s change in npv and first northern s gap analysis 
if first northern s change to npv and gap is not within the limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate risk  first northern has developed strategies to manage its liquidity  shorten the effective maturities of certain interest earning assets  and increase the effective maturities of certain interest bearing liabilities 
first northern has focused on i its residential lending on adjustable interest rate mortgages  which generally reprice within one to three years  ii its non residential lending on adjustable or floating rate and or short term loans  iii its investment activities on short and intermediate term securities  iv maintaining and increasing its passbook and transaction deposit accounts  which are considered to be relatively resistant to changes in interest rates  and v utilizing long term borrowings and deposit marketing programs to adjust the term to repricing of its liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of an increase or decrease of basis points of assumed changes in market interest rates up to basis points 
npv is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
the company s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in the npv in the event of sudden and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for a basis point to a basis point shock level as of december   and the board s established limitations relating thereto 
all market rate sensitive instruments presented in this table are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale 
the company has no trading securities 
actual percent board change in interest rate npv change change limit dollars in thousands basis point rise   basis point rise   basis point rise   base scenario  basis point decline   basis point decline   basis point decline   the preceding table indicated that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates  the company s npv would be expected to decrease 
at december   the company s estimated changes in npv were within the targets established by the board of directors 
npv is calculated based on the net present value of estimated cash flows utilizing first northern s prepayment assumptions and market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources 
computation of forecasted effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the npv analysis 
actual cash flows and values may differ from those projections presented  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the npv analysis 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent one of first northern s primary loan products  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable interest rate loans in first northern s portfolio could decrease in future periods if market interest rates remain at or decrease below current levels due to refinancing activity 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the npv analysis 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate mortgage loans may decrease in the event of interest rate increases
