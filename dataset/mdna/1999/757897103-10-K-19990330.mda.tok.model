this segment is highly sensitive to changes in mortgage interest rates and local economical conditions 
in the fourth quarter of the company significantly curtailed its wholesale mortgage loan originations operations associated with the wholesale generation of mortgage loans which predominantly conform to the underwriting standards set by fannie mae  freddie mac  or other institutional investors 
this type of activity is commonly referred to as a paper wholesale mortgage banking 
this decision was taken due to concerns over declining profit margins and interest rate risk

the interest rates charged for the loans made by the company vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loans  the borrowers depository relationships with the company and prevailing money market rates indicative of the company s cost of funds 
concentration of the company s lending activities in the real estate sector could have the effect of intensifying the impact on the company of adverse changes in the real estate market in the company s lending areas 
the ability of the company to continue to originate mortgage loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions  adverse changes in the real estate market  increasing interest rates  or acts of nature including earthquakes or floods  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures the company s loans 
due to the concentration of the company s real estate collateral  such events could have a significant adverse impact on the value of such collateral or the company s earnings

real estate construction loans 
real estate construction loans are primarily for residential housing

the economic viability of the project and the borrower s past development record and creditworthiness are primary considerations in the loan underwriting decision 
the company had  in construction loans outstanding at december   comprising of its total loans 
these loans were principally located in northern california 
this represents a decrease of  or from in construction loans decreased  or from approximately million of these loans consisted of single family individual borrower construction loans  and the remaining loans included subdivision projects  land development projects and commercial projects

as the builder completes various line items foundation  framing  electrical  etc 
of the project  or portions of those line items  the work is reviewed by one of several independent inspectors hired by the company 
upon approval from the inspector  the company funds the draw request according to the percentage completion of the line items that have been approved 
the company rotates inspectors during construction to ensure independent review 
actual funding checks must be signed by an officer of the company  and that officer must also initial the line item worksheet used to support the draw request 
in addition  company personnel or agents routinely inspect the various construction projects  all of which are located in the company s lending area 
commercial real estate mortgage and construction lending contains potential risks which are not inherent in other types of commercial loans 
these potential risks include declines in market values of underlying real property collateral and  with respect to construction lending  delays or cost overruns which could expose the company to loss 
in addition  risks in commercial real estate lending include declines in commercial real estate values  general economic conditions surrounding the commercial real estate properties and vacancy rates 
a decline in the general economic conditions or real estate values within the company s market area could have a negative impact on the performance of the loan portfolio or value of the collateral 
because the company lends primarily within its market area  the real property collateral for its loans is similarly concentrated  rather than diversified over a broader geographic area 
the company could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in real estate values in its primary market area even if real estate values elsewhere in california remained stable or increased

in these cases  the mortgage collateral is often taken as additional collateral 
as of december   the size of individual commercial loans varied widely  with having principal balances less than  at december   the company had commercial borrowers whose aggregate individual liability exceeded  loan commitments 
in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial statements 
annual review of the commercial credit lines and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments 
as of december   the company had outstanding  in unfunded mortgage loan commitments   in undisbursed loan commitments and  in standby letters of credit 
the company s undisbursed commercial loan commitments represent primarily business lines of credit

in addition to the company s local depository offices  it attracts certificates of deposit  primarily from financial institutions throughout the nation  by publishing rates in national publications 
these certificates of deposit have often been attracted at interest rates at or above local market retail deposit rates 
the national deposit market is utilized to supplement funding for the company s mortgage banking activities and other liquidity needs

these loans must conform to established freddie mac fannie mae underwriting criteria  including a maximum dollar limit  maturities that vary from five to thirty years  loan to value ratios of or less or less with mortgage insurance  adequate borrower liquidity  and the ability of the borrower to service the mortgage debt and all other debt out of income 
loans sold to other investors  such as savings and loans  insurance companies and other conduits  usually are for dollar amounts in excess of the freddie mac fannie mae limit  but otherwise generally meet standard freddie mac fannie mae underwriting criteria 
as part of its residential lending activities  the company enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage loans  either in the form of mortgage backed securities mbs or as whole loans 
these commitments may be optional or mandatory 
under optional commitments  a commitment fee is paid and the company carries no risk in excess of the loss of such fee in the event that the company is unable to deliver sufficient mortgage loans to fulfill the commitment 
mandatory commitments may entail possible financial risk to the company if it is unable to deliver mortgage loans in sufficient quantity or at sufficient rates to meet the terms of the commitments 
in order to minimize the risk that a change in interest rates will result in a decrease in the value of the company s current mortgage loan inventory or its commitments to purchase or originate mortgage loans committed pipeline  the company enters into hedging transactions 
the company s hedging policies generally require that its inventory of mortgage loans held for sale and the maximum portion of its committed pipeline that may close be hedged with forward sales of mbs or options to buy or sell mortgage backed or us treasury securities 
as such  the company is not exposed to significant risk nor will it derive any significant benefit from changes in interest rates on the price of the mortgage loan inventory net of gains or losses of associated hedge positions 
the correlation between the price performance of the hedge instruments and the inventory being hedged is very high due to the similarity of the asset and the related hedge instrument 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that the portion of loans from the committed pipeline that actually closes at the committed price is less than the portion expected to close in the event of a decline in rates  and in the event such decline in closings is not covered by forward contracts and options to purchase mbs needed to replace the loans in process that do not close at their committed price 
the company determines the portion of its committed pipeline that it will hedge based on numerous factors  including the composition of the company s committed pipeline  the portion of such committed pipeline likely to close  the timing of such closings and the current interest rate environment

servicers of loans sold to freddie mac or fannie mae generally receive a loan servicing fee of at least

servicing fees for other investors can vary according to market conditions at the time the loan is sold 
in general  the value of the company s loan servicing portfolio may be adversely affected by declining mortgage interest rates and increasing loan prepayments 
income generated from the portfolio may also decline in such an environment 
in a low interest rate environment  the rate at which mortgage loans are prepaid tends to increase as borrowers refinance their loans 
a high level of prepayments for an extended period of time could have an adverse effect on the value of the company s pmsr pools  the level of the company s outstanding loan portfolio  and the size of its mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
additionally  the company s decision to sell servicing rights  and the timing of such sales  may affect the company s earnings on a quarter to quarter basis 
certain factors  including demand and prepayment  delinquency and foreclosure rates  could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell servicing rights and the value of those rights 
in a rising interest rate environment  prepayments of loans decrease and the value of the company s loan servicing portfolio will decline at a slower rate 
the following table sets forth the dollar amounts of the company s mortgage loan servicing portfolio at the dates indicated  the portion of the company s loan servicing portfolio resulting from loan originations and purchases and the carrying value as a percentage of loans serviced 
december  in thousands loans acquired or originated by the company and sold    loans underlying purchased mortgage servicing rights   total    purchased and originated mortgage servicing rights purchased and originated mortgage servicing rights as a percentage of loans serviced 


management may from time to time determine to sell the company s mortgage loans on a servicing released basis based on market conditions 
the company sells loan servicing rights to offset the cost of originating mortgage loans 
the amount of loan servicing rights sold annually by the company may vary because of market fluctuations in the pricing of loan servicing rights  and the amount of gain upon sale of servicing rights may vary significantly from period to period 
in the company sold a portion of its originated servicing rights on a bulk basis for gains of  no such gains or losses were realized in and the company also purchases mortgage servicing rights pmsr in order to better utilize its servicing capabilities and to take advantage of market prices which management believed to be favorable 
the amounts the company pays for the rights to service loans are carried on the company s statement of financial condition as intangible assets and are amortized in proportion to  and over the estimated life of  the related pools of mortgage loans using a method approximating the interest method 
the company s carrying values of purchased mortgage servicing rights  and the amortization thereon  are evaluated quarterly  by portfolios  and such carrying values are adjusted for indicated impairments based on management s best estimate of the remaining cash flows 
such estimates may vary from the actual remaining cash flows due to unanticipated prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans and increases in servicing costs 
the company s carrying values of purchased mortgage servicing rights do not purport to represent the amount that would be realizable by a sale of these assets in the open market 
the company s omsr and pmsr amortization  including valuation adjustments  totaled  for   for  and  for the amortized values of the company s pmsr pools were  and  at december  and  respectively 
there was no amortized value at december  asset quality the company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies 
the company conducts its own internal credit review processes and  in addition  contracts with an independent loan reviewer who performs monthly reviews of new loans and potential problem loans that meet predetermined parameters 
the boards of directors of nbr has an internal asset review committee which reviews the asset quality of new and problem loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board 
in management s opinion  this loan review system facilitates the early identification of potential problem loans 
the performance of the company s loan portfolio is evaluated regularly by management 
the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when one of the following events occurs any installment of principal or interest is days or more past due unless  in management s opinion  the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  management determines the ultimate collection of principal of or interest on a loan to be unlikely  or the terms of a loan have been renegotiated to less than market rates due to a serious weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
with respect to the company s policy of placing loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal of or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure 
these statements address the accounting and reporting by creditors for impairment of certain loans 
in general  a loan is impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
these statements are applicable to all loans  uncollateralized as well as collateralized  except loans that are measured at the lower of cost or fair value 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  the company measures impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans are measured for impairment as part of the company s normal internal asset review process 
the effect of adopting sfas has not been material to the company s balance sheet or statement of operations 
interest income is recognized on impaired loans in a manner similar to that of all loans 
it is the company s policy to place loans that are delinquent days or more as to principal or interest on nonaccrual status unless secured and in the process of collection  and to reverse from current income accrued but uncollected interest 
cash payments subsequently received on nonaccrual loans are recognized as income only where the future collection of principal is considered by management to be probable 
at december  and the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans was  and  of which  and  relates to the recorded investment for which there is a related allowance for credit losses of  and  determined in accordance with these statements 
the amount of that recorded investment for which there is no related allowance for credit losses determined in accordance with these statements was  and  at december  and at december  approximately of the impaired loan balance was measured based on the fair value of the collateral  with the remainder measured by estimated present value cash flow 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans during the year ended december  and was  and  the related amount of interest income recognized during the period that such loans were impaired was  and  no interest income was recognized using a cash basis method of accounting during the period that the loans were impaired 
as of december  and there were  and  of loans on which the accrual of interest had been discontinued

other real estate owned totaled  at december   consisting of  in construction and land development and  in residential properties 
other assets owned were contract receivable rights and repossessed personal property carried at  in addition to the above mentioned assets  as of december  management of the company has identified six lending relationships which in aggregate amount to approximately  in potential nonperforming loans  as to which it has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms and which may become nonperforming assets  based on known information about possible credit problems of the borrower 
the following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge off and recovery activity

allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to  and recoveries are credited to  the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is determined after considering various factors such as loan loss experience  current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent loan reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses  and the overall quality of the portfolio  as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses is based on specific and formula allocations to the company s loan portfolio 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made to identified problem or potential problem loans 
the specific allocations are increased or decreased through management s reevaluation of the status of the particular problem loans 
loans which do not receive a specific allocation receive an allowance allocation based on a formula  represented by a percentage factor based on underlying collateral  type of loan  historical charge offs and general economic conditions  which is applied against the general portfolio segments 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains adequate to cover anticipated charge offs  and management believes that the allowance at december  is adequate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may be required in future periods 
the provision for loan losses reflects an accrual sufficient to cover projected probable charge offs and the maintenance of the allowance at a level deemed adequate to absorb potential future losses 
the table below sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type as of the dates specified 
the allocation of individual categories of loans includes amounts applicable to specifically identified as well as unidentified losses inherent in that segment of the loan portfolio and will necessarily change whenever management determines that the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio have changed 
management believes that any breakdown or allocation of the allowance for loan losses into loan categories lends an appearance of exactness which does not exist  in that the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans and undisbursed commitments 
the allocation below should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur december  allowance of allowance of allowance of allowance of for losses loans for losses loans for losses loans for losses loans dollars in thousands residential real estate mortgage     commercial real estate mortgage  commercial     real estate construction     installment and other unallocated  total     allowance of for losses loans residential real estate mortgage  commercial real estate mortgage commercial  real estate construction installment and other unallocated total  in the company was required by various mortgage loan investors to repurchase non performing residential mortgage loans or purchase foreclosed real property 
from time to time the company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans from investors depending upon representations and warranties of the purchase agreement between the investor and the company 
such representations and warranties include valid appraisal  status of borrower  first payment default or fraud 
primarily these repurchases involve loans which are in default 
the company expects that it may be required to repurchase loans in the future 
the company maintains a reserve for its estimate of potential losses associated with the potential repurchase of previously sold mortgage loans 
such reserve amounts to  as of december  liquidity redwood s primary source of liquidity is dividends from nbr 
redwood s primary uses of liquidity are associated with cash payments made to the subordinated debt holders  dividend payments made to the preferred stock holders  and operating expenses 
it is the company s general policy to retain liquidity at the parent at a level which management believes to be consistent with the safety and soundness of the company as a whole 
as of december   redwood held  in deposits at nbr and a  subordinated note issued by nbr 
in  redwood reinstated a cash dividend to its common stock holders at a quarterly rate of 
per share 
payment of dividends by the company is ultimately dependent on dividends from nbr to redwood 
federal regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by nbr to redwood if a finding is made that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice  or if nbr became undercapitalized 
if nbr is restricted from paying dividends  redwood could be unable to pay the above obligations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of nbr to pay dividends to redwood 
in  nbr declared dividends of  although each entity within the consolidated group manages its own liquidity  the company s consolidated cash flows can be divided into three distinct areas  operating  investing and financing 
for the year ended december  the company received  and  in cash flows from operations and investment activities while using  in financing activities  respectively 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are federal funds sold and loans held for sale 
secondary sources of liquidity are loan repayments  investments available for sale  maturing investments  and investments that can be used as collateral for other borrowings 
at december   the company had  in federal funds sold and  in loans held for sale 
total investments were  of which  were pledged 
time deposits from other financial institutions totaled  or 
of total deposits  at december   a decrease of  from the  recorded at december   which amounted to 
of total deposits at that time 
these deposits are used to supplement liquidity when the company determines that deposits from local sources would be more expensive 
the company is able to retain such deposits at favorable rates when desired 
the volume of these deposits is dependent on anticipated mortgage origination volumes 
liability based liquidity includes interest bearing and noninterest bearing retail deposits  which are a relatively stable source of funds  time deposits from financial institutions throughout the united states  federal funds purchased  and other short term and long term borrowings  some of which are collateralized 
the company collateralized fhlb advances as nbr is a member of the fhlb 
management uses fhlb advances as part of its funding strategy because the rates paid for those advances are generally lower than the rates paid on deposits 
fhlb advances must be collateralized by the pledging of qualified mortgage loans of nbr 
nbr s fhlb borrowing limitation at december  and december  was  at december   nbr had  in fhlb advances outstanding  as compared to  at december  management believes that at december  the company s liquidity position was adequate for the operations of redwood and its subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 
capital a strong capital base is essential to the company s continued ability to service the needs of its customers 
capital protects depositors and the deposit insurance fund from potential losses and is a source of funds for the substantial investments necessary for the company to remain competitive 
in addition  adequate capital and earnings enable the company to gain access to the capital markets to supplement its internal growth of capital 
capital is generated internally primarily through earnings retention 
the company and nbr are each required to maintain minimum capital ratios defined by various federal government regulatory agencies 
the frb and the occ have each established capital guidelines  which include minimum capital requirements 
the regulations impose two sets of standards risk based and leverage 
under the risk based capital standard  assets reported on an institution s balance sheet and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each of which is assigned a risk weight 
this standard characterizes an institution s capital as being tier capital defined as principally comprising shareholders equity and noncumulative preferred stock and tier capital defined as principally comprising the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt 
at december   and  the company and its subsidiaries were required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  including a tier capital ratio of at least 
under the leverage capital standard  an institution must maintain a specified minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  with the minimum ratio ranging from to for other than the highest rated institutions 
the minimum leverage ratio for the company and nbr is based on average assets for the quarter 
nbr maintains insurance on its customer deposits with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic manages the bank insurance fund bif  which insures deposits of commercial banks such as nbr  and the savings association insurance fund saif  which insures deposits of savings associations such as allied 
fdicia mandated that the two funds maintain reserves at of their respective federally insured deposits 
the table below shows the capital ratios for the company and nbr at december company nbr total capital to risk based assets tier capital to risk based assets leverage ratio under the most stringent capital requirement  the company has approximately  in excess capital before it becomes under capitalized 
similarly  nbr has  in excess capital 
year problem the year problem relates to the fact that many computer programs and equipment utilizing microprocessors only use two digits to represent a year  such as to represent  which means that in the year such programs processors could incorrectly treat the year as the year the company s business is highly dependent on technology and data processing 
as a result  bank management and the board of directors have made year compliance a high priority 
the issue must be recognized as a business issue  rather than simply a computer issue  because of the way its effects could ripple through the economy 
the company could be affected either directly or indirectly by the year issue 
this could happen if any of its critical computer systems or equipment containing embedded logic fail  if the local infrastructure power  communication system  or water system fails  if its significant vendors or third party processors are adversely impacted  or if its borrowers or depositors are significantly impacted by their internal systems or their customers or suppliers 
the company principally relies on third party software and processing for its mission critical applications needs 
it licenses software and or data processing services from outside vendors for its critical functions such as mortgage lending  merchant credit card program  atm  item processing and customer statements 
the company also is dependent on personal computers and a local area network which is supported by a microsoft operating environment 
the foregoing systems are classified by the company as mission critical information technology it systems 
the company s business also involves non it products and services  some of which have embedded technology which might not be year ready 
some non it products and services involve infrastructure issues such as power  communications and water  as well as elevators  ventilation and air conditioning equipment 
the company classifies power and communications as non it mission critical systems 
the company s third party application software  data processing vendors  local area network and operating systems and the power and communication infrastructure provide critical support to substantially all of its business and operations 
failure to successfully complete renovation  validation and implementation of mission critical it systems could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial performance of the company 
moreover  year issues experienced by significant vendors or third party processors or customers of the company could negatively impact the business and operations of the company even if its critical it systems function satisfactorily 
due to the many variables related to the year issue and the lack of information on year readiness from non it service providers such as power and phone systems vendors  the company cannot quantify the potential cost of problems if the company s renovation and implementation efforts or the efforts of significant vendors or customers are not successful 
state of readiness the company has formed a year team comprised of senior level employees and officers who are familiar with the business and operations of the company 
the year team has conducted a comprehensive review of the company s it systems to identify systems that present year issues 
the company has developed a plan which it believes should satisfactorily resolve year problems related to its mission critical it systems 
the company s year team is also using external resources provided by outside vendors and a consultant hired to assist the company 
many vendors and third party processors of the company s critical it systems have informed the company that their products systems are year compliant 
the company s merchant credit card program is dependent on a third party processor 
this processor s testing for year compliance is ongoing 
no alternate vendor is readily available 
in the event this vendor cannot satisfactorily process credit card changes for merchants in the bank s program  the bank s results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if initial testing for other critical it systems is not satisfactory  the company plans to commence taking corrective action and complete secondary testing by on or about june  the company has run tests on selected components of its core processing system during with technical assistance from the vendor and an outside consultant 
at the date of this report the company believes it remains on schedule to complete initial testing of all mission critical it systems by june costs the company is expensing all period costs associated with the year issue 
through december   the amount of such expense has been approximately  management estimates that the bank will incur approximately an additional  in year related expenses for the identification  correction and reprogramming  and testing of systems for year compliance in fiscal there can be no assurance that these expenses will not increase as further testing and assessment of vendor and customer readiness for the year continues 
the above cost estimates include costs for consultants  running tests  technical assistance from vendors and costs for products replaced for year compliance 
these costs exclude the cost of the company s internal staff time 
risks management believes it will be difficult to predict the outcome of the year issue due to the complexity of technology and the inability to assess the impact of the year problem on third party processors  non it mission critical systems and the local  national and international economy 
management has attempted  however  to identify a most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
this scenario suggests that the year problem might negatively impact some of the company s significant it vendors and processors and non it vendors products through the failure of the party to be prepared or the impact on them of their own vendors and customers including possible short term power failures 
management believes that if this scenario occurs its ability to process mortgages and or credit card charges could be temporarily delayed and earnings could be materially adversely impacted especially if a recession results 
it is not possible to predict the effect of this scenario on the economic viability of its customers and the related adverse impact it may have on the company s financial position and results of operations  including the level of the bank s provision for possible loan losses in future periods 
further  there can be no assurance that other possible adverse scenarios will not occur 
the company presently believes that  with modifications to existing software within its control which needs to be made year compliant and assuming representations of year readiness from significant it vendors  processors and customers are accurate  the year issue should not pose significant operational risks for the company s it systems as so modified 
however  other significant risks relating to the year problem are that of the unknown impact of this problem on the operations of the bank s customers  processors and vendors  the impact of catastrophic infrastructure failures such as power  communications and water on the company s systems  the economy and future actions which banking or securities regulators may take 
the company is making efforts to ensure that its customer base is aware of the year problem 
year correspondence has been sent to both deposit and loan customers 
the bank has amended its credit authorization documentation to include consideration regarding the year problem 
significant customer relationships have been identified  and such customers are being contacted by the bank s employees to determine whether they are aware of year risks and whether they are taking preparatory actions 
the company has also attempted to contact major vendors and suppliers of non software products and services including those where products utilize embedded technology  to determine the year readiness of such organizations and or the products and services which the company purchases from such organizations 
the company is monitoring reports provided by such vendors regarding their preparations for year this is an ongoing process  and the company intends to continue to monitor the progress of such vendors through the century date change 
federal banking regulators have responsibility for supervision and examination of banks to determine whether each institution has an effective plan for identifying  renovating  testing and implementing solutions for year processing and coordinating year processing capabilities with its customers  vendors and payment system partners 
examiners are also required to assess the soundness of an institution s internal controls and to identify whether further corrective action may be necessary to assure an appropriate level of attention to year processing capabilities 
management believes it is currently in compliance with the federal bank regulatory guidelines and timetables 
contingency plans the company has developed contingency plans for software systems utilized by the company  should they not successfully pass the company s year testing 
generally this involves the identification of an alternate vendor or expected actions the company could take  as well as the establishment of a trigger date to implement the contingency plan 
the company is also considering the purchase of a backup generator to provide power for certain critical functions in the event of a power failure and additional cash will be on hand for potential liquidity needs 
company personnel are being trained to manually perform certain critical functions if computers fail 
the company intends to develop  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  further contingency plans to address potential business disruptions resulting from year issues 
however  this process is not expected to be substantially completed until on or about june  the company s contingency plans will be subject to change throughout item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest bearing liabilities and all of the company s interest earning assets are located at the bank  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
based upon the nature of its operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within northern california  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the company does not own any trading assets 
see asset quality 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the economic value of the company while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the bank s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the bank manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the bank seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the bank has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
as part of this effort  the bank measures risk in three ways repricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in net interest income for interest rate shocks up and down basis points  and changes in the market value of equity for interest rate shocks up and down basis points 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the distribution of repricing opportunities for the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
after three after six after one within months but months but year but three within six within within after five months months one year five years years total dollars in thousands earning assets federal funds sold   investment securities and other       mortgage loans held for sale   loans       total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts   time deposits      other borrowings   subordinated notes   total interest bearing liabilities      interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 

cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 


the company s gap position is substantially dependent upon the volume of mortgage loans held for sale and held in the portfolio 
these loans generally have maturities greater than five years  however  mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold within to days of funding and therefore are classified in the above table as repricing within three months 
the company enters into commitments to sell such loans on a forward basis  usually within to days 
the amount of loans held for sale and the amount of forward commitments can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
additionally  interest bearing transaction accounts  which consist of money market  demand and savings deposit accounts  are classified as repricing within three months 
some of these deposits may be repriced at management s option  and therefore a decision not to reprice such deposits could significantly alter the company s net interest margin 
management expects that  in a declining rate environment  the company s net interest margin would be expected to decline  and  in an increasing rate environment  the company s net interest margin would tend to increase 
the company has experienced greater mortgage lending activity through mortgage refinancings and financing new home purchases as rates declined  and may increase its net interest margins in an increasing rate environment if more traditional commercial bank lending becomes a higher percentage of the overall earning assets mix 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances the company will experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
on a monthly basis  nbr management prepares an analysis of interest rate risk exposure 
such analysis calculates the change in net interest income and the theoretical market value of the bank s equity given a change in general interest rates of basis points up and basis points down 
all changes are measured in dollars and are compared to projected net interest income and the current theoretical market value of the bank s equity 
this theoretical market value of the bank s equity is calculated by discounting cash flows associated with the company s assets and liabilities 
the following is a december  and summary of interest rate risk exposure as measured on a net interest income basis and a market value of equity basis  given a change in general interest rates of basis points up and basis points down 
change in annual change in net interest market value of change in interest rate income equity the model utilized by management to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities 
in addition  repricing these earning assets and matured liabilities can occur in one of three ways the rate of interest to be paid on an asset or liability may adjust periodically based on an index  an asset  such as a mortgage loan  may amortize  permitting reinvestment of cash flows at the then prevailing interest rates  or an asset or liability may mature  at which time the proceeds can be reinvested at current market rate 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change
