item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction death care businesses in the united states traditionally have been relatively small family owned enterprises that have been passed down through successive generations within a family 
the industry in the united states  and in certain foreign countries  is undergoing a transition in which family owned firms are consolidating with larger organizations  such as the company 
although the company s future participation in this consolidation cannot be guaranteed  the company believes that it has been successful in identifying and acquiring firms that have enhanced shareholder value  and it will continue to explore expansion opportunities  both domestically and internationally  although it expects most of its expansion to continue to occur within the united states 
two other trends affecting the death care industry are the expected increase in the number of deaths and the average age of the population 
according to the united states bureau of the census  the number of deaths in the united states is expected to increase by approximately per year from million in to million in in addition  the average age of the population in the united states is increasing 
the aging of the population  particularly the baby boomers who have only recently begun to turn  represents a significant opportunity for firms such as the company to expand their customer base and secure a portion of their future market share by actively marketing prearranged property  merchandise and services 
according to the bureau of the census  the united states population over years of age will increase from million in to million in the company s principal target market for sales of prearranged cemetery property  merchandise and services is customers who are age and above

see cautionary statements 
the discussion herein should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
change in accounting principles effective november   the company changed accounting principles for prearranged funeral and cemetery sales as follows i the company now defers a portion of the earnings realized by irrevocable prearranged funeral trust funds and escrow accounts in order to offset the estimated effects of inflation on the future cost of performing prearranged funeral services  ii the company now records all revenues and costs attributable to prearranged sales of cemetery interment rights and related products at the time the contract is signed  and iii the company now records revenue and related costs attributable to cemetery burial site openings and closings at the time of sale 
the accounting changes were made principally to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses in the appropriate periods and to more accurately reflect the company s operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item these changes generally will result in reduced near term funeral revenue and gross profit  due to the deferral of a portion of the earnings from funeral trust funds and escrow accounts until the funeral is performed 
these changes also will result in higher near term cemetery revenue and gross profit  due to the recognition under the accrual basis of accounting of certain cemetery sales 
the net effect is expected to result in increased revenues and gross profit from amounts that would have been reported under the company s previous accounting methods 
trust and escrow investments the company s funeral and cemetery business includes prearranged sales funded through trust and escrow arrangements  as well as maintenance of cemetery grounds funded through perpetual care funds 
the company s investment strategy for these funds is  among other criteria  partially dependent on the ability to withdraw net realized capital gains from these funds 
however  withdrawal of capital gains is not permitted for perpetual care funds in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates 
accordingly  funds for which net capital gains are permitted to be withdrawn typically are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting principally of us government securities  other interest bearing securities and preferred stocks rated a or better  blue chip publicly traded common stocks  money market funds and other short term investments 
the company generally recognizes as revenue on a current basis from trust funds and escrow accounts all dividends  interest and net realized capital gains in excess of the amount to be deferred to offset expected increases in the future costs of performing prearranged funeral services 
income from funds  especially those invested partially in common stock  can be materially affected by prevailing interest rates and the performance of the stock market 
in managing its north american funds  including those in puerto rico and excluding those in mexico  which include investments in common stock  the company seeks an overall annual rate of return of approximately to 
in the past three years  such funds have generated overall annual rates of return in that range 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving any particular rate of return

the repurchase of certain of the options by the company and the exercise of the remaining options resulted in a net cash outlay of approximately million 
in july and august  the company granted new options under the incentive compensation plan to officers and employees for the purchase of  shares of class a common stock at exercise prices equal to the fair market value on the grant dates  which ranged from to per share 
one third of the options become exercisable in annual increments beginning on july  the remaining two thirds of the options become exercisable in full on the first day between the grant date and july  that the average of the closing sale prices of a share of class a common stock over the preceding consecutive trading days equals or exceeds  which represents a annual compounded growth in the price of a share of class a common stock over five years

other year issues overview 
as the year approaches  all companies that use computers must address year issues 
year issues result from the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
this practice can create breakdowns or erroneous results when computers perform operations involving years later than the company s state of readiness 
the company has devised and commenced an extensive compliance plan with the objective of bringing all of the company s information technology it systems and non it systems into year compliance by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the company has divided its systems into i critical systems  consisting of it systems  and ii non critical systems  consisting of a mixture of it and non it systems 
each system will be evaluated and brought into compliance in five phases phase i awareness prepare and present comprehensive report to management phase ii assessment identify and evaluate all systems for year compliance phase iii compliance complete necessary year modifications phase iv testing test all modified systems for year compliance phase v implementation return year compliant systems to daily operation phase i has been completed 
additionally  all of the company s critical systems have completed phase ii and were found to be compliant or made to be compliant by completing phases iii through v 
the remaining of the company s critical systems have commenced phase iii through phase v and the company anticipates that these systems will be brought into compliance by the end of the second quarter of fiscal fifty percent of the company s non critical systems have completed phase ii and were either found to be compliant or were brought into compliance by completing phases iii through v 
the company anticipates that the remaining non critical systems will be evaluated and brought into compliance by the end of the second quarter of fiscal in addition  the company has distributed surveys to all of its significant vendors  financial institutions and insurers to determine the extent to which their failure to resolve their year issues could affect the company s operations 
the company has received of the surveys  none of which indicated significant problems 
the company expects to complete its evaluation of third parties compliance by the end of february the costs involved 
because many of the company s computer systems have been replaced in recent years as part of the company s on going goal to maintain state of the art technology  the company s year compliance costs have been relatively low 
to date  the company has incurred expenses of approximately  for external consultants  software and hardware applications in implementing its compliance plan 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the year project 
such costs are principally payroll related costs for the company s information technology group 
management estimates that the total external cost to be incurred by the company to complete its compliance plan will be approximately  all costs related to the year compliance plan are included in the information systems budget and are based on management s best estimates 
there can be no guarantee that actual results will not differ from those estimated or that such difference will not be material 
risks 
if the company is not successful in its efforts to bring its systems into year compliance the company s ability to procure merchandise in a timely and cost effective manner may be impaired daily business procedures may be delayed due to the use of manual procedures some business procedures may be interrupted if no alternative methodology is available each of these items could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company has no guarantee that the systems of third parties will be brought into compliance on a timely basis 
the non compliance of a third party s system could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company s contingency plan 
although the company believes that its year compliance plan is adequate to achieve full system operation on a timely basis  the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan to address the possibility of the company s and third parties non compliance

forward looking statements certain statements made herein or elsewhere by or on behalf of the company that are not historical facts are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s goals for fiscal year include i revenue growth of at least  and ii earnings per share growth of 
the company also plans to complete at least million in acquisitions  which is in line with the million achieved in fiscal year  but above the million and million in acquisitions achieved in fiscal years and  respectively 
for fiscal year  the company also plans to improve its gross margin by approximately to basis points over its fiscal year gross margin 
the company s strategic plan for the future includes the following goals i achievement of billion in revenue by fiscal year and ii earnings per share growth of annually 
forward looking statements are based on assumptions about future events and are therefore inherently uncertain  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
see cautionary statements below 
cautionary statements the company cautions readers that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual consolidated results and could cause the company s actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward looking statements above and in any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
achieving projected revenue growth depends in part upon sustaining the level of acquisition activity experienced by the company in the last three fiscal years 
higher levels of acquisition activity will increase anticipated revenues  and lower levels will decrease anticipated revenues 
the level of acquisition activity depends not only on the number of properties acquired  but also on the size of the acquisitions  for example  one large acquisition could increase substantially the level of acquisition activity and  consequently  revenues 
several important factors  among others  affect the company s ability to consummate acquisitions a the company may be unable to find a sufficient number of businesses for sale at prices the company is willing to pay 
b in most of its existing markets and in many new markets  including foreign markets  that the company desires to enter  the company competes for acquisitions with the other publicly traded death care firms 
these competitors  and others  may be willing to pay higher prices for businesses than the company or may cause the company to pay more to acquire a business than the company would otherwise have to pay in the absence of such competition 
thus  the aggressiveness of the company s competitors in pricing acquisitions affects the company s ability to complete acquisitions at prices it finds attractive 
c achieving the company s projected acquisition activity depends on the company s ability to enter new markets  including foreign markets 
due in part to the company s lack of experience operating in new areas and to the presence of competitors who have been in certain markets longer than the company  such entry may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated by the company 
achieving the company s revenue goals also is affected by the volume and prices of the properties  products and services sold 
the annual sales targets set by the company are very aggressive  and the inability of the company to achieve planned increases in volume or prices could cause the company not to meet anticipated levels of revenue 
the ability of the company to achieve volume or price increases at any location depends on numerous factors  including the local economy  the local death rate and competition 
another important component of revenue is earnings from the company s trust funds and escrow accounts  which are determined by the size of  and returns which include dividends  interest and realized capital gains on  the funds 
the performance of the funds depends primarily on market conditions that are not within the company s control 
the size of the funds depends on the level of sales  funds added through acquisitions and the amount of returns that may be reinvested 
future revenue also is affected by the level of prearranged sales in prior periods 
the level of prearranged sales may be adversely affected by numerous factors  including deterioration in the economy  which causes individuals to have less discretionary income 
the company first entered foreign markets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be successful in expanding in foreign markets  or that any expansion in foreign markets will yield results comparable to those realized through the company s expansion in the united states 
in addition to the factors discussed above  earnings per share may be affected by other important factors  including the following a the ability of the company to achieve projected economies of scale in markets where it has clusters or combined facilities 
b whether acquired businesses perform at pro forma levels used by management in the valuation process and whether  and the rate at which  management is able to increase the profitability of acquired businesses 
c the ability of the company to manage its growth in terms of implementing internal controls and information gathering systems  and retaining or attracting key personnel  among other things 
d the amount and rate of growth in the company s general and administrative expenses 
e changes in interest rates  which can increase or decrease the amount the company pays on borrowings with variable rates of interest 
f the company s debt to equity ratio  the number of shares of common stock outstanding and the portion of the company s debt that has fixed or variable interest rates 
g the impact on the company s financial statements of nonrecurring accounting charges that may result from the company s ongoing evaluation of its business strategies  asset valuations and organizational structures 
h changes in government regulation  including tax rates and their effects on corporate structure 
i changes in inflation and other general economic conditions  both domestically and internationally  affecting financial markets eg marketable security values as well as exchange rate fluctuations 
j unanticipated legal proceedings and unanticipated outcomes of legal proceedings 
k changes in accounting policies and practices adopted voluntarily or required to be adopted by generally accepted accounting principles 
l the ability of the company and its significant vendors  financial institutions and insurers to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
the company also cautions readers that it assumes no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company
