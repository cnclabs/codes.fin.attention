overview from its inception in november through december   the company was in the development stage 
during that period  the company primarily focused on the development of its manufacturing processes in order to transition from laboratory scale to commercial scale production 
as a result  the company developed an operating capacity to produce significant quantities of its nanocrystalline materials for commercial sale 
the company was also engaged in the development of commercial applications and formulations and the recruiting of marketing  technical and administrative personnel 
since january   the company has been engaged in commercial production and sales of its nanocrystalline materials  and the company no longer considers itself in the development stage 
all of the company s revenue since january  has been generated through commercial sources 
from inception through december   the company was primarily capitalized through the private offering of approximately  of equity securities and its initial public offering of  of common stock  each net of issuance costs 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of  from inception through december  results of operations years ended december  and revenue is recorded when the company ships products  when specific milestones are met regarding development arrangements or when the company licenses its technology and transfers proprietary information 
total revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in total revenue between and was primarily attributed to a  increase in product revenue offset by a  reduction in other revenue 
product revenue increased to  in  compared to  in other revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the majority of the revenue generated in was from customers in the electronics and structural ceramics and composites markets 
revenue from four customers constituted of the company s revenue 
in particular  revenue from i ekc technology  inc  a manufacturer of semiconductor polishing slurries ekc  ii cik  iii a ceramics customer and iv an electronics customer constituted approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
the company does not currently anticipate future revenue from either the ceramics customer or the electronics customer 
see risk factors dependence on a limited number of key customers 
cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production  customer development arrangements and licensing fees 
cost of revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in cost of revenue was generally attributed to the reduced cost of development activities and efficiencies in the manufacture of the company s products  somewhat offset by inefficiencies in the company s coating operations and increased ceramic superplastic forming costs 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in  compared to the same period in  due primarily to the decrease in total revenue 
research and development expense primarily consists of costs associated with the company s development or acquisition of new product applications and coating formulations and the cost of enhancing the company s manufacturing processes 
research and development expense increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributed to increased costs of  related to arrangements with outside parties to further develop end use products utilizing nanocrystalline materials  slightly offset by reductions in internal costs regarding the development of new formulations and product applications 
the company expects to further increase its research and development expense in in connection with its plans to continue to enhance and expand its product lines  technologies and manufacturing processes 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in the selling  general and administrative expense in included a one time charge of  related to a public offering withdrawn in may excluding such one time charge  selling  general and administrative expense increased by  in over the net increase was primarily attributed to increased costs associated with being a public company  costs related to ongoing investor relation programs  additional legal expenses  salaries of additional sales and administrative personnel and increased recruiting and relocation costs 
the company expects to further increase its selling  general and administrative expense during in connection with its plans to further expand its sales force and administrative staff 
interest income increased to  in  compared to  in this increase was primarily due to the investment of net proceeds from the company s sale of equity securities pending use of such proceeds 
the company expects interest income to decrease in as such proceeds are utilized 
income tax expense was  compared to in the expense was due to the foreign taxes withheld from license fees received from cik 
the payment of such taxes creates a foreign tax credit which may be available to offset federal income taxes when the company generates taxable income 
years ended december  and total revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in total revenue was due primarily to a one time technology transfer fee of  from cik for a license to use certain patented technology to exclusively manufacture  use and sell the company s nanocrystalline materials in asia  a product development fee of  from moyco technologies  inc moyco  a one time fee of  from cik for training in the operation of a pvs reactor  and increased customer development revenue and product shipments 
product revenue increased to  in  compared to  in other revenue increased to  in  compared to  in total revenue for the year ended december  was primarily generated from customers in the electronics and structural ceramics and composites markets 
in particular  revenue from moyco and cik constituted approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue in revenue from governmental research contracts decreased to for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  because the company did not pursue any further us government contracts for the year 
see risk factors dependence on a limited number of key customers 
cost of revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in cost of revenue was generally attributed to increased efficiencies in the manufacture of the company s products and the reduced cost of product development activities 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased significantly for the year ended december   compared to the same period in because of the increased efficiencies in the company s manufacturing processes  minimal costs associated with the one time technology transfer fee from cik and the product development fee from moyco  and increased production volumes 
research and development expense increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in research and development expense is attributable primarily to the acquisition of certain knowledge and technology from moyco for a one time fee of  increased costs of developing new coating formulations and product applications  and ongoing experimentation expenses associated with technological enhancements and product improvements 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in this increase is attributable primarily to the expending of certain one time costs aggregating  related to a proposed public offering withdrawn in may and certain one time costs associated with the company s asian distribution agreement with cik 
these one time costs were offset by decreases in selling and general expenses 
interest income increased to  in  compared to  in this increase is primarily due to the investment of net proceeds from its sale of equity securities pending use of such proceeds for operating activities and expansion of its manufacturing facilities 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments amounted to  at december   compared to  at december  the net cash used in the company s operating activities was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily for the further development of product applications  the funding of research and development activities  the funding of inventory levels and the payment of accounts payable  which was offset by the collection of accounts receivable and an increase in accrued liabilities 
net cash provided by or used in investing activities  including capital expenditures and purchases of securities in which cash is invested pending its use for operating activities and expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities offset by maturities of such securities  amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures  primarily related to the further expansion of the company s existing manufacturing facilities and the purchase of operating equipment  amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities  which related to the exercise of options and warrants for  shares of common stock  amounted to  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  which related to the net proceeds from the issuance of equity securities 
the company believes that cash from operations and cash on hand  together with the remaining net proceeds from the offering and interest income thereon  will be adequate to fund the company s current operating plans 
the company s actual future capital requirements will depend  however  on many factors  including customer acceptance of the company s current and potential nanocrystalline materials and product applications  continued progress in the company s research and development activities and product testing programs  the magnitude of these activities and programs  and the costs necessary to increase and expand the company s manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell the company s materials and product applications 
depending on future requirements  the company may seek additional funding through public or private financing  collaborative relationships  government contracts or additional licensing agreements 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  and any such additional financing could be dilutive to the company s stockholders 
see risk factors future capital needs 
at december   the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for income tax purposes 
because the company may have experienced ownership changes within the meaning of the us internal revenue code in connection with its various prior equity offerings  future utilization of this carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as defined by the internal revenue code 
if not utilized  the carryforward expires at various dates between and as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of this carryforward may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce income tax liabilities 
at december   the company also had a foreign tax credit carryforward of  which could be used as an offsetting tax credit to reduce us income taxes 
the foreign tax credit will expire in if not utilized before that date 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has identified the following areas as possibly being affected by the year issue i it and non it systems  ii manufacturing applications and iii third party relationships 
for each of these areas  the company is in the process of identifying and assessing specific software  equipment and systems which are potentially susceptible to the year issue 
the company expects to develop and implement corrective actions  if necessary  to ensure that by september  its software  equipment and systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company believes the total cost of such year compliance activities will not be material 
the company believes that it has no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold to date 
the company processes its transactions and applications utilizing personal computers 
in addition  the company s telephone system  fax machines  payroll  alarm systems and other miscellaneous systems utilize computer equipment and software 
the company is identifying which software and equipment needs to be upgraded 
based on its assessment to date  the company does not believe that significant modifications or replacements of its software or systems will be required to be year compliant 
as of january   the company only acquires software and invests in systems which are year compliant 
the company s manufacturing activities rely on its pvs plasma reactors comprised of modular equipment that contains embedded technology 
the company also relies on a quality control laboratory for production process control 
the company is identifying the particular hardware and software systems used in such manufacturing applications to assess whether they are year compliant 
the company believes such manufacturing applications are year compliant 
to date  the company does not have any direct interface between its systems and those of any significant supplier or customer 
the company  however  relies on third party suppliers for raw materials  utilities  cash management services and other key supplies and services 
the company  therefore  recognizes that it is vulnerable to third party suppliers that fail to remediate their own year issues 
the company is corresponding with its significant suppliers to determine their year compliance status 
the company is also dependent upon its customers  product development partners and distributors for sales  cash flow and product development 
although the company has received some formal information concerning the year compliance status of certain of its customers  product development partners and distributors  this information is limited and incomplete at this time 
the company has  however  received indications that most of these entities are working on year compliance 
the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to the year issue is that i its manufacturing systems may malfunction and ii third party suppliers of ceramic and metallic materials  cash management services and utilities  customers  product development partners and distributors may be unable to remediate their own year issues 
in such scenario  the company could experience manufacturing interruptions  difficulties in accessing its cash and investments  delays in distribution of its products  delays in development of new product applications and reduced shipments 
this would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company currently has no contingency plan in the event such most reasonably likely worst case scenario occurs 
the company currently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified or remediated on a timely basis  the company s results of operations or relationships with customers and suppliers may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the systems of other companies on which the company relies may not be timely converted and any failure by them to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
legal proceedings as disclosed in note to the financial statements and under item legal proceedings in part i  five separate complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division  each of which alleged that the company  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of the company s offering are liable under the federal securities laws for making material misstatements of fact and omitting and failing to state material facts necessary to make other statements of fact not misleading in the registration statement and prospectus relating to the offering 
in an order entered by the court  those cases were consolidated and a consolidated complaint was filed on october  the consolidated complaint alleges that the action should be maintained as i a plaintiff class action on behalf of certain persons who purchased the common stock from november  through january   excluding the defendants  members of their immediate families  any entity in which a defendant has a controlling interest and certain others related to or affiliated with the foregoing  and ii a defendant class action against the underwriters who participated in the offering 
the consolidated complaint seeks unquantified damages as provided for under the federal securities laws  pre and post judgment interest  attorneys fees  expert witness fees  other costs and expenses and such other and further relief as the court may find proper 
in addition  the consolidated complaint seeks rescission and or rescissory damages relating to purchases of the common stock  as provided for under federal securities laws 
all defendants have filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint that are fully briefed and under advisement by the court 
on november   a separate complaint was filed in the northern district of illinois  eastern division  which alleged that the company  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of the company s offering are liable under the federal securities laws for making material misstatements of fact and omitting or failing to state material facts necessary to make other statements of fact not misleading in connection with the solicitation of consents to proceed with the offering from certain of the company s preferred stockholders 
the complaint alleges that the action should be maintained as a plaintiff class action on behalf of those former preferred stockholders whose shares of preferred stock of the company were converted into common stock on or about the date of the offering  excluding the defendants  other officers and directors of the company  members of the immediate families of all individual defendants  any entity in which a defendant has a controlling interest and certain others related to  employed by or affiliated with the foregoing 
the complaint seeks unquantified damages as provided for under the federal securities laws  pre and post judgment interest  attorneys fees  expert witness fees  other costs and expenses and such other and further relief as the court may find proper 
on march   the preferred stockholders complaint was referred to the court s executive committee for possible i reassignment to the judge hearing the consolidated complaint described above and ii further consolidation with that litigation 
the company  the defendant directors and the defendant officers have each retained counsel with respect to both of the above described litigations and intend to defend against both complaints vigorously 
although the company believes that the allegations of the complaints are without merit  it is unable to predict at this time the outcome of either litigation or whether the resolution of either litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
risk factors investors should consider the following risks in connection with an investment in the company 
limited history of commercial revenue  uncertain market acceptance of the company s nanocrystalline materials the company was founded in november and through december  was engaged principally in research and development activities 
while the company recently commenced marketing certain nanocrystalline materials  it is in the early stage of commercialization and the potential product applications utilizing the company s nanocrystalline materials are in various stages of development or under evaluation 
as a result  the company s nanocrystalline materials have been sold only in limited quantities  often for testing and evaluation purposes  and a significant market may not develop for such materials 
because most  if not all  of the solutions utilizing the company s materials are new and innovative  the company s time to market for commercial products utilizing its materials has historically been at least months and may take several years 
the company is attempting to reduce this period by organizing and restructuring internal resources 
the company may be unable to decrease this time to market 
the company s current and potential commercial customers establish demanding specifications for performance and reliability 
the company s nanocrystalline materials may not meet future customer performance standards  or offer sufficient price or performance advantages as required to achieve commercial success 
the company s failure to develop  manufacture and commercialize nanocrystalline materials on a timely and cost effective basis or successfully reduce the time to market of commercial products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
because the company s materials are used as ingredients in  or components of  other companies products  the inability of the company s customers to achieve market acceptance with respect to end users of their products or to successfully manufacture their products could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
limited operating history  history of losses  uncertainty of future profitability the company began shipping significant amounts of its materials for commercial use in january accordingly  the company has only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
an investment in the company must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development 
the company s nanocrystalline materials may not generate significant revenues from commercial applications 
the company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of  the company may continue to incur operating losses and may be unable to achieve a profitable level of operations 
if the company does achieve profitability  it may be unable to sustain it 
commercial development of the company s nanocrystalline materials will require the commitment of substantial resources to continuing research and development  establishment of additional commercial scale and pilot scale manufacturing facilities  and further development of quality control  marketing  sales  service and administrative capabilities 
the company s ability to achieve profitability will depend on many factors  including the company s ability to enter into collaborative customer relationships and the company s ability  alone or with its customers  to develop  manufacture  introduce and market commercially acceptable products based on the company s nanocrystalline materials and proprietary processes 
the company and its customers may not successfully manufacture  introduce or market significant quantities of the company s nanocrystalline materials or their product applications 
dependence on a limited number of key customers a limited number of key customers have initially accounted for a substantial portion of the company s commercial revenue 
for example  revenue from ekc  cik  a ceramics customer and an electronics customer constituted approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
the company does not currently anticipate future revenue from either the ceramics or electronics customer 
the company s customers are significantly larger than  and are able to exert a high degree of influence over  the company 
the loss of one or more of the company s customers or failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in december  nanophase entered into a seven year supply agreement with ekc  a subsidiary of chemfirst  a manufacturer of semiconductor polishing slurries  pursuant to which the company has agreed to supply certain of its nanocrystalline materials and provide related research and customer and technical support to ekc 
this agreement  as subsequently amended  supersedes the company s five year requirements contract with moyco and was entered into after moyco sold its chemical mechanical polishing intellectual property  technologies and certain other intangible assets to ekc in december if ekc does not purchase certain separate minimum dollar amounts specified in the agreement  the company may terminate ekc s exclusivity  future supply obligation or the entire agreement 
revenue from ekc is currently expected to constitute a significant portion of the company s revenues over the next several years 
to date  ekc s purchase of the company s materials has been for a lesser dollar amount and on a slower timetable as compared to that which the company previously expected from moyco and this may continue 
reliance on collaborative development relationships the company has established  and will continue to pursue  collaborative relationships with a variety of corporate customers 
through such relationships  the company seeks to develop applications for the company s nanocrystalline materials  share development and manufacturing resources and coordinate the development  manufacturing  commercialization and marketing of nanocrystalline product applications 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on its continued relationships with these customers  its ability to enter into similar collaborative relationships  the commitment of the company s customers to the potential product applications under development and  eventually  the customers success in manufacturing and marketing  or willingness to purchase the company s nanocrystalline materials for  such product applications 
the company s customers may decide to manufacture jointly developed products internally  obtain them from alternative sources or no longer pursue their development 
these customers may require the company to share control of its development  manufacturing and marketing programs  limit its ability to license its technology to others  or restrict its ability to engage in certain product development  manufacturing and marketing activities 
these relationships may also be subject to unilateral termination by the company s customers 
if the company is unable to initiate or sustain such collaborative relationships  the company may be unable to independently develop  manufacture  market or sell its current and future nanocrystalline materials or their product applications 
the failure of the company to initiate or sustain such collaborative relationships would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
limited manufacturing capacity and experience the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to manufacture its nanocrystalline materials in significant quantities  with consistent quality  at acceptable cost  on a timely basis  and in a format needed by its customers 
the company has limited experience in high volume manufacturing and may incur significant start up costs and unforeseen expenses in connection with attempts to manufacture substantial quantities 
the company will need to improve manufacturing efficiency significantly  implement additional manufacturing capability and expand its current facilities and or obtain other facilities in the near future in order to manufacture adequate quantities of its products to meet expected market demands 
the company may be unable to make the transition from pilot manufacturing to high volume manufacturing successfully on a timely basis 
the company may also be unable to successfully develop its surface treatment and dispersion technologies so as to be able to coat significant quantities of its nanocrystalline materials with consistent quality  at acceptable cost and on a timely basis 
the company may have to develop manufacturing capability that enables it to produce dispersions  slurries  or formulations that contain its nanocrystalline materials in order to provide solutions demanded by certain customers and or markets 
the company s primary operations  including research  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and general administration  are housed in a single facility in burr ridge  illinois 
any material disruption in the company s operations  whether due to fire  natural disaster  power loss or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
while the company maintains property and business interruption insurance  such insurance may not adequately compensate the company for all losses that it may incur 
dependence on patents and protection of proprietary information the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain patent protection for its nanocrystalline materials and processes  to preserve its trade secrets  and to operate without infringing the patent or other proprietary rights of others and without breaching or otherwise losing rights in the technology licenses upon which any of the company s products are based 
the company has been granted three united states patents  all of which expire in july  has filed three applications for other united states patents and licenses eleven patents held by others  which licenses generally last the life of their respective patents 
the patent applications filed by the company may not result in issued patents and the scope and breadth of any claims allowed in any patents issued to the company or its licensors may not exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company 
in addition  any patents issued to the company or its licensors may not be held valid if subsequently challenged 
others may claim rights in the patents and other proprietary technology owned or licensed by the company 
it is also possible that others have developed or will develop similar products or technologies without violating any of the company s proprietary rights 
the company s inability to obtain patent protection  preserve its trade secrets or operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  as well as the company s loss of any license to technology that it now has or acquires in the future  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
patent applications in the united states are currently maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period of time after filing 
accordingly  publication of discoveries in the scientific literature or of patents themselves or laying open of patent applications in foreign countries tends to lag behind actual discoveries and filings of related patent applications 
due to this factor and the large number of patents and patent applications related to nanocrystalline materials  comprehensive patent searches and analysis associated with nanocrystalline materials are often impractical or not cost effective 
therefore  the company s patent and publication searches may not have been comprehensive  or materials or processes used by the company for its planned products may  now or in the future  infringe upon existing technology described in united states patents or may infringe upon claims of patent applications of others 
because of the volume of patents issued and patent applications filed relating to nanocrystalline materials  there is a significant risk that current and potential competitors and other third parties have filed or will file patent applications for  or have obtained or will obtain patents or other proprietary rights relating to  materials or processes used or proposed to be used by the company 
in any such case  to avoid an infringement  the company would have to either license such technology or design around any such patents 
the company may be unable either to successfully design around these third party patents or obtain licenses to such technology or if obtainable  such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to the company 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to the company  to defend the company against infringement claims made by others  or to determine the ownership  scope or validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
an adverse outcome in any such litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the company to seek licenses from third parties  and or require the company to cease using certain technology  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may also become involved in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office pto in connection with one or more of the company s owned or licensed patents or patent applications to determine priority of invention 
any such proceeding could result in substantial cost to the company  as well as a possible adverse decision as to priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved 
in addition  the company may become involved in reissue or reexamination proceedings in the pto in connection with the scope or validity of the company s owned or licensed patents 
any such proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and an adverse outcome in such proceeding could result in a reduction of the scope of the claims of any such patents or such patents being declared invalid 
in addition  from time to time  to protect its competitive position  the company may initiate reexamination proceedings in the pto with respect to patents owned by others 
such proceedings could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company  and an adverse decision in such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how in the conduct of its business and uses employee and third party confidentiality and non disclosure agreements to protect such trade secrets and know how 
the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets or proprietary information may wrongfully be breached by employees  consultants  advisors or others and the company may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  the company s trade secrets or proprietary know how may otherwise become known or be independently developed or discovered by third parties 
in addition  because the company s employees have not entered into noncompetition agreements with the company  they may become competitors of the company upon termination of employment 
rapid technological change rapid changes have occurred  and are likely to continue to occur  in the development of advanced materials and processes 
the future success of the company will depend  in large part  upon its ability to keep pace with advanced materials technologies  industry standards and market trends and to develop and introduce new and improved products on a timely basis 
the company will require substantial resources to expand its commercial manufacturing capacity  further develop its technologies and develop and introduce innovative product applications 
the company s development efforts may be rendered obsolete by the research efforts and technological advances of others or other advanced materials may prove more advantageous than those produced by the company 
limited marketing experience  use of distribution agreements the company has limited experience marketing and selling its products 
to market its nanocrystalline materials directly  the company must continue developing a marketing and sales force that can effectively demonstrate the advantages of its nanocrystalline product applications compared to competitive products containing conventional or advanced materials 
the company currently has arrangements for distribution of certain of its nanocrystalline materials and expects to enter into additional distribution or other arrangements with third parties regarding the commercialization or marketing of its materials 
the company s future success will depend in part on its continued relationships with distributors  its ability to enter into other distribution arrangements  the continuing interest of the company s distributors in current and potential product applications and  eventually  the distributors success in marketing  or willingness to purchase  any of the company s nanocrystalline materials 
the company may be unsuccessful in its marketing efforts or may be unable to establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or to enter into or maintain marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties on financially acceptable terms 
in addition  any third parties with whom it enters into such arrangements may not be successful in marketing the company s products 
in february  the company and wcd mutually agreed to end their cosmetics and skin care ingredients distribution relationship 
while the company may discuss distribution arrangements with other companies having access to the cosmetics and skin care market and is currently selling directly to a small number of cosmetic and skin care customers  the company may be unable to maintain significant worldwide access to such market 
revenue from international sources for the year ended december   of the company s total revenues were derived from product shipments to  and development agreements with  international customers  and the company expects that it will continue to derive a substantial percentage of revenues from international customers in the future 
the company may be unable to successfully market  sell and deliver its nanocrystalline materials in international markets 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting international business  including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  political instability  foreign withholding taxes relating to royalties  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of such factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  the company has a license agreement with cik for the distribution of its materials throughout various asian countries 
the recent economic uncertainties in korea and other asian markets may continue and could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to generate revenue from such markets 
competition the advanced materials industry is highly competitive 
the market for materials having the characteristics and potential uses of the company s nanocrystalline materials is the subject of intensive research and development efforts by both governmental entities and private enterprises around the world 
the company believes that the level of competition will increase further as more product applications with significant commercial potential are developed 
the nanocrystalline product applications being developed by the company will compete directly with products incorporating conventional and advanced materials and technologies 
while the company is not currently aware of the existence of commercially available competitive products with the same attributes as those offered by the company  such competitive products may be introduced by third parties  or competing materials based on different or new technologies may become commercially available 
the company s competitors may succeed in developing or marketing materials  technologies and products that exhibit superior performance  are more commercially desirable or are more cost effective than those developed or marketed by the company 
in addition  many potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial and technical resources  larger research and development staffs  and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than the company 
failure of the company s current and potential nanocrystalline product applications to improve performance sufficiently at an acceptable price  achieve commercial acceptance or otherwise compete with conventional materials would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
volatility of common stock price and associated litigation during the first few months after the offering  the market price of the company s common stock was volatile 
following such volatility in the market price of the company s common stock  securities class action litigation was instituted against the company 
such litigation initiated against the company may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company 
in particular  there has been significant volatility in the market price of securities of technology companies  particularly those that  like the company  are still primarily engaged in product development activities 
factors such as announcements of technology innovations and new product applications  collaborative development relationships or distribution relationships by the company or its competitors  disputes relating to patents and proprietary rights  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  failure to meet or exceed earnings expectations of the market or of analysts  general market conditions and actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly operating results may have a significant impact on the future market price of the common stock 
future capital needs the company believes that its future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress in its research and development and product testing programs  the magnitude of these programs  the costs necessary to increase the company s manufacturing capabilities and to market any resulting materials and product applications  and customer acceptance of the company s current and potential materials and product applications 
additional factors that may affect the company s future capital requirements are the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patents and other proprietary rights or in obtaining licenses  the ability of the company to establish collaborative relationships  the costs related to the company s possible acquisition of complementary technologies or businesses  and the amount and timing of future revenues 
depending on its requirements  the company may seek additional funding through public or private financing  collaborative relationships  government contracts or licensing agreements 
such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate manufacturing and marketing of one or more of its materials or product applications or research and development programs  or to obtain funds through arrangements with customers or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or nanocrystalline materials that the company would not otherwise relinquish 
inadequate funding also could impair the company s ability to compete in the marketplace 
dependence on key personnel the company s success will depend  in large part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified research and development  management  manufacturing and marketing and sales personnel 
due to the specialized nature of the company s business  it may be difficult to locate and hire qualified personnel  and to retain such personnel once hired
