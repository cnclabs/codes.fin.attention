gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year the decrease in gross margins was primarily attributable to the lower average selling prices of the registrant s core products and raw material price increases  which principally occurred in the first six months of fiscal year the lower average selling prices were a result of competitive pressures and an increase for some product lines in the proportion of larger volume orders which were priced at substantial discounts

beginning in the second half of fiscal year  the registrant experienced a slowdown in orders from foreign customers for its core commercial products 
the registrant believes that this slowdown was primarily the result of the deferral or reduction of several customers manufacturing programs in response to the economic turmoil in several foreign countries particularly in asia and increased competition in foreign markets particularly in europe 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year compared with in fiscal year the increase in gross margins was attributable to the fact that the general manufacturing process problems that negatively affected margins for a large part of the fiscal year were not fully resolved until the second quarter of fiscal year  and the favorable effect of greater production and sales volumes in the first half of the fiscal year combined with a generally fixed cost manufacturing base 
the increase was somewhat offset by continued erosion in prices for the registrant s core products and higher fixed costs in the second half of fiscal year relative to sales volume

accounts receivable increased by  to  at june  as compared to  at june  the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to slightly slower collections of customer accounts and the increased sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal year inventories increased by  to  at june  as compared to  at june  this increase was attributable to an increase in work in process in order for the registrant to fill customer orders and increased inventories of raw materials  particularly palladium  as a hedge against unavailability and unstable pricing for this primary raw material for the registrant s products

market risks the registrant has identified four market risks relative to its business interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and security price risk 
the registrant has managed its market risk exposures in order to minimize their potential impact on its financial conditions and results of operations 
specifically a interest rate risk 
in light of the registrant s existing cash balances  the results of its operations  the terms of its debt obligations and its projected capital needs  it does not believe that a significant change in interest rates would have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources b foreign currency exchange rate risk

the registrant believes that  based upon its current levels of production  it owns a sufficient supply of palladium  such that the registrant would not have to buy any additional quantities should there be a short term increase in price 
in addition  the registrant s inventory carrying cost of palladium would not be materially impacted by a decline in current market prices 
d security price risk 
the registrant s current portfolio of marketable securities consists of us treasury notes with varying maturities of up to ten years 
the registrant currently plans to manage any exposure resulting from declining prices by holding any securities which decline substantially in value until maturity
