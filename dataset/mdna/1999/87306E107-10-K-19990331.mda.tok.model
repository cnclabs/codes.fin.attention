item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we own and operate a diversified group of middle market industrial manufacturing and distribution businesses whose products include metal fasteners  large and heavy pressure vessels  high pressure industrial valves and related products and services 
operations are organized into three core business segments i fastener manufacturing and distribution  ii heavy fabrication  and iii valve manufacturing and repair 
through a fourth segment  we also distribute machine tools 
our historical financial statements have been restated to include  for all periods presented  the results of operations from each of the companies that were acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the results of operations for companies acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method are included in our historical financial statements from the date of such acquisition 
since these purchase acquisitions were consummated at various times  the financial information contained herein with respect to each fiscal period does not fully reflect the results of operations that would have been achieved had these acquisitions been consummated at the beginning of the periods presented or which may be achieved in the future 
in connection with each purchase acquisition  we have recorded goodwill to the extent the purchase price exceeded the fair market value of the specific assets acquired 
our results of operations are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries served by our customers  which in turn may be affected by other factors  including the level of economic activity in the us and foreign markets they serve 
the principal industries served by our clients are the automotive  home furnishings  petrochemical and oil and gas industries 
an economic slowdown in these industries could result in a decrease in demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect our operating results 
during  oil and gas prices declined significantly  resulting in a decrease in the demand for our products and services that are used in the exploration and production of oil and gas 
absent substantial increases in oil and gas prices  we expect demand for these products and services to continue to remain depressed from levels 
in  one of our operating units  imsco  was moved from the valve manufacturing and repair segment to the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment 
as a result  and segment information has been restated to reflect the change consistent with management s view of the operations of the business 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of our segments for each of the periods presented

on a consolidated basis sales increased  or in compared to sales for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or in compared to this increase was primarily as a result of the acquisitions of two companies in the third quarter of and the inclusion of a full year of operations of two companies in that were acquired in late the heavy fabrication segment was formed july  with the acquisition of beaird 
under the purchase method of accounting  no sales were recorded relating to this segment prior to the second half of sales for the six months ended december  increased compared to the periods prior to the acquisition of beaird by approximately million or over the comparable period and million or over the six months ended june  sales increased based on a strategic decision to increase sales by expanding the range of products manufactured 
sales for the valve manufacturing and repair segment increased  or in compared to this sales increase was almost entirely attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operations of a company acquired in the third quarter of sales for the machine tool distribution segment decreased  or as demand for machine tools declined in the texas gulf coast region 
cost of sales 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales increased  or in compared to cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared to in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was higher on a consolidated basis primarily as a result of the addition in of the heavy fabrication segment  which typically has lower gross margins on its large contract business in comparison to our other segments

cost of sales for the heavy fabrication segment as a percentage of sales was for the six months ended december  gross margins were adversely affected by the significant increase in sales during a period in which we were unable to hire or retain adequate skilled workers due to the terms of our then existing union contract that covered most of beaird s workforce 
the union contract expired in november and the effectiveness of the workforce was further reduced during the period of contract renegotiation 
a new collective bargaining agreement was entered into in late november we believe that the terms of this agreement provides us with adequate flexibility to hire employees with the appropriate skills 
with the settlement of the contract and additional new hires  beaird experienced improvements in labor efficiency beginning in december however  due to the increase in backlog during the third and fourth quarters  the effects on gross margins in the fourth quarter of are expected to continue through the first quarter of as beaird reduces its backlog 
cost of sales for the valve manufacturing and repair segment increased  or compared to cost of sales increased as a result of the comparable increase in sales

selling  general and administrative expenses for the valve manufacturing and repair segment decreased  or in compared to this was primarily as the result of the elimination of the salary and related expenses of the president of a company who resigned in connection with our acquisition of the company  which was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the machine tool distribution segment for did not change significantly from selling  general and administrative expenses at corporate increased  or in compared to primarily as a result of personnel increases and increases in professional fees that have resulted from our growth

sales for the valve manufacturing and repair segment increased  or in compared to  primarily as a result of an acquisition in march and an million increase in sales at our other operating subsidiaries within this segment 
sales increases at these subsidiaries were primarily attributable to the strength of the energy sector in machine tool distribution segment sales decreased  or primarily because of delays in receipts of machine tools from manufacturers  which caused some cancellation of orders by customers as well as deferral of shipments to customers to cost of sales 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales increased  or in compared to however  cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared to in cost of sales for the fastener manufacturing and distribution segment increased  or in compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisitions in and and a million increase in cost of sales at our other operating subsidiaries within this segment as a result of the increase in sales described above

the increase at our operating subsidiaries was the result of the increase in sales described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased at a greater percentage than sales because of the inclusion of goodwill amortization associated with the acquisitions in and selling  general and administrative expenses for the valve manufacturing and repair segment increased  or primarily as the result of an acquisition in march and a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses at our other operating subsidiaries within this segment due to increased sales 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses at one of our other operating subsidiaries in this segment 
this increase was less than the related increase in sales as most costs at that subsidiary are accounted for as cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the machine tool distribution segment increased  or for compared to primarily as a result of the hiring of four additional sales people in there was no significant change in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
on a consolidated basis  interest expense increased  or in compared to the increase was the result of increases in debt related to two acquisitions in november and february this increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense at one of our other operating subsidiaries as a result of a  conversion of debt to equity in other income net 
on a consolidated basis  other income increased  or in compared to this increase was primarily the result of a  insurance gain related to a fire at an unused manufacturing facility and a  gain on the sale of equipment 
income taxes

net income was  in compared to  in as a result of the foregoing factors 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of  short term debt of  current maturities of long term debt of  long term debt of  and shareholders equity of  historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for debt service  capital expenditures  working capital and acquisition financing  and our principal sources of liquidity and cash have been from cash flows from operations  borrowings under long term debt arrangements and issuances of equity securities 
we have financed acquisitions through bank borrowings  sales of equity and internally generated funds 
net cash used by operating activities 
for the year ended december   net cash used by operating activities was million compared to and  which provided cash of million and million 
the cash used in was primarily as a result of the acquisition of beaird and the related net increases in receivables  inventory  other assets and accounts payable over those acquired 
beaird s receivables and inventories increased as sales increased for the six months ended december  compared to the six month period ended june   which was prior to the beaird acquisition 
additionally  receivables and payables increased at beaird as million in accounts receivable and all liabilities were distributed to the seller prior to acquisition 
cash was provided in and primarily because net income and depreciation and amortization were greater than increases in current assets resulting from increased sales 
net cash used by investing activities 
principal uses of cash are for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
for  and  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
other significant investing activities included acquisitions 
the aggregate cash purchase price for acquisitions was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities 
our principal sources of cash are from financing activities  including borrowings under our credit facilities  and sales of equity securities 
financing activities provided net cash of million in compared to using cash of million in and providing cash of million in during  we issued common stock providing net proceeds of million compared to net proceeds of million in and million in during we completed an offer to the holders of our class b warrants to exchange each class b warrant and cash for one share of common stock  one class c warrant and one class d warrant  from which we received net proceeds of million after deducting approximately million of related expenses 
the common stock proceeds were used to repay million in term debt and to fund acquisitions 
during  we borrowed million under our credit facilities compared to million and million during and principal debt instruments 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million borrowed under our principal bank credit facility and debt instruments entered into or assumed in connection with acquisitions as well as other bank financings 
of these borrowed amounts  million is scheduled to mature during certain of our debt arrangements contain requirements as to the maintenance of minimum levels of working capital and net worth  minimum ratios of debt to cash flow  cash flow to certain fixed charges  liabilities to tangible net worth and capital expenditures 
at december   we were not in compliance with several of these covenants  however we obtained waivers for the non compliance from those lenders 
in the future  we may not be able to comply with all of these covenants and no assurance can be given that if unable to comply  we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders 
we are currently exploring various financing alternatives to meet our future liquidity needs 
we anticipate refinancing certain of our debt facilities in the second quarter of  although no assurances can be given that we will be able to refinance such facilities or that we will be able to obtain terms that are as favorable as those that currently exist 
our existing credit facility is a revolving line of credit with comerica bank texas 
the principal amount is the lesser of million or a defined borrowing base 
the credit facility bears interest at the prime rate of comerica which was at december  and allows the borrowing of funds based on of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
at december   the borrowing capacity under the credit facility was million and availability was million 
at march   the borrowing capacity was million and availability was million 
we entered into a loan from a financial institution in the principal amount of million that matures in november this loan bears interest at libor plus 
in connection with the acquisitions of businesses  we also have entered into various term loans secured by machinery  equipment and real estate of the businesses acquired and issued a convertible debenture in connection with the acquisition of beaird 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
belleli energy 
in  we entered into an option agreement that grants us the right to purchase approximately of belleli energy srl belleli through belleli is an italian company that manufactures thick walled pressure vessels and heat exchangers  as well as designs  engineers  constructs and erects components for desalination  electric power and petrochemical plants 
the option agreement calls for two payments annually totaling approximately  in   in   in and  in we have agreed during the option period to support the financing of belleli in order for it to achieve its operating plan 
we anticipate that the majority of this financing will take the form of providing bonding for projects that belleli undertakes  and to a lesser extent  working capital infusions 
at december   we have provided  in working capital loans  which are supported by accounts receivable  and  in bonding support in the form of letters of credit   of which have expired subsequent to year end 
we currently anticipate that belleli may need up to million in financial support from us through the end of which may be in the form of bonding  working capital loans or other financing 
to date  we have been able to provide financing support to belleli through bonding arrangements with our bank and cash flow from operations  however  even if we are successful in refinancing certain of our debt facilities in the second quarter  there can be no assurance that such sources will continue to be available to the extent necessary to provide adequate support to belleli  which would require us to pursue additional sources of financing on terms that may be less desirable or advantageous than our current arrangements or force us to sell to a third party all or part of our rights to purchase belleli 
inflation although we believe that inflation has not had any material effect on operating results  our business may be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality we believe that our business is not subject to any significant seasonal factors  and do not anticipate significant seasonality in the future 
year compliance we are exposed to the risk that the year issue the year issue could cause system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
during  we undertook a corporate wide initiative designed to assess the impact of the year issue on software and hardware utilized in our operations  including information technology infrastructure it and embedded manufacturing control technology non it and the impact  if any  that the year issue  as it relates to customers and suppliers could have on our business 
this initiative is being conducted in three phases assessment  implementation and testing 
during the assessment phase  we completed a comprehensive inventory of it and non it systems and equipment 
many of our it systems include hardware and packaged software recently purchased from large vendors who have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
however  we have determined that it will be necessary to modify portions of our financial and accounting software 
we believe that with modifications to existing software  the year issue can be mitigated 
the implementation of these remediation efforts is underway and is expected to be completed by june  however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on operations 
we plan to complete the testing of the year modifications as these modifications are implemented 
we have not established a contingency plan but intend to formulate one to address unavoidable risks  and we expect to have the contingency plan formulated by mid we do not currently rely on the it systems of other companies  however  failure of our suppliers or customers to become year compliant might have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we intend to continue to pursue an acquisition strategy and  as a result  there can be no assurance that the it systems being used by an acquired company will be compliant with the year issue or that any such conversion or failure to convert an acquired system would not have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
efforts with respect to the year issue have been handled internally by our management and our other employees 
costs of developing and carrying out this initiative are being funded from operations and have not represented a material expense 
we have not completed our remediation efforts but currently believe that the costs of the year issue will not be significant and will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cashflows

disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources regarding our estimate of sufficiency of existing capital resources and ability to raise additional capital to fund cash requirements for future operations 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements will prove to have been correct 
the ability to achieve these expectations is contingent upon a number of factors  which include demand for products  need for additional capital for newly acquired companies and the ability to complete new acquisitions 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rate under our revolving line of credit 
under the revolving line of credit  the principal balance is due in june as of december   the revolving line of credit had a principal balance of million at a floating interest rate of per annum 
we also have million of long term debt bearing interest at libor plus to 
the libor rate as of december  was 
a increase in interest rates could result in a million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balance 
we have determined that it is not necessary to participate in interest rate related derivative financial instruments because we currently do not expect significant short term increases in interest rates charged under the revolving line of credit
