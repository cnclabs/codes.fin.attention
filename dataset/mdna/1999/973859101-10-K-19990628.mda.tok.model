as an investment company  the company evaluates its investment portfolio periodically to determine the fair value of the portfolio and  accordingly  does not maintain an allowance for loan losses similar to commercial banks 
any change in the fair value of loans and other investments is reflected in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of loans and investments  but has no impact on net investment income 
there was unrealized appreciation on loans and investments of  for the year ended march  principally reflecting the market price of equity investments in two publicly traded portfolio companies compared with unrealized depreciation of  for the year ended march  and unrealized appreciation of  for the year ended march  liquidity and capital resources in january  the company paid a non refundable commitment fee of  to the sba to reserve  of sba guaranteed debentures through september during the year ended march   the company drew down  of such debentures bearing an interest rate of per annum

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  management does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial statements and results of operations 
year many computer software systems in use today cannot properly process date related information from and after january  this is not an exposure for the company since it does not currently rely on any particular software program to track either its investment portfolio or to provide accounting functions 
in addition  the company has inquired of its commercial banks and other service providers as well as of its major portfolio companies to determine if they will be prepared for the year while all have indicated they are taking the necessary steps to be in compliance  there can be no assurance that all exposure will be eliminated 
it is anticipated that the company will incur no material expenses related to the year issue
