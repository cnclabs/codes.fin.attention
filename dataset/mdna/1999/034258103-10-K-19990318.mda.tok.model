item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition general 
the company s results of operations depend to a great extent on the banks net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on their loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid on their deposits and borrowed funds  the size of the provisions or credits for loan losses and operating expenses 
net interest income is primarily affected by the level of earning assets as a percentage of total assets  the level of interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
earnings are also affected by non interest income which consists primarily of mortgage banking income  transaction account fees  gains and losses on sales of the investment portfolio and real estate operations 
the levels of operating expenses and income taxes also affect earnings 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated results of operations for the last three years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal and this section is intended to be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the following also contains forward looking statements 
there are a number of important risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the company s actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors include  without limitation  those set forth under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
results of operations andover generated net income of million or per diluted share  million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share in  and  respectively 
andover s return on average assets increased in to  as compared to in and in return on average stockholders equity increased in to  as compared to in and in the company s financial performance in was positively impacted by a credit for loan losses of million and an increase in net interest income 
the financial performance in was impacted by an increase in total earning assets as well as the net yield on those assets 
the financial performance in was positively impacted by a one time gain in the form of a tax benefit of million  partially offset by a pre tax loss of million from the sale of low yielding investments and the early extinguishment of debt 
net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income was million in  million in and million in net interest income increased million during and million during as a result of higher average earning asset volumes in both of those years 
market interest rates have been fairly volatile over the past several years 
during  the difference between longer term interest rates and shorter term interest rates have lessened  thereby creating a flat yield curve 
this continued compression in the margins has been reflected in the declines in both the interest rate spread of and the net yield of for during  the interest rate margin of and the interest rate spread of were favorably impacted by the restructure of the balance sheet undertaken in the latter part of this restructure enabled the company to recognize a six basis point increase in the yield on interest earning assets while maintaining only a basis point increase on the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the amount of foregone interest income from nonaccruing and restructured loans totaled  in   in and  in average earning assets increased in to  million as of december   and increased during to  million 
the increase in each of the two years was primarily due to higher loan growth resulting from increased loan originations and purchases 
the volatility in the interest rates has also impacted the yields earned on the investment portfolio 
the yield on short term investments decreased basis points during to  yet increased basis points during to 
the yields earned on investment securities remained flat in compared to an increase of basis points to in the yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points during to and increased basis point during to 
during  there were three decreases in the federal funds rate totaling basis points while there was an increase of basis points in  all of which impacted the short term investment yield in a corresponding manner 
the increase in the yield in on the investment securities was primarily due to the balance sheet restructure 
the decline in the yield on mortgage backed securities reflects the decline in long term interest rates since the cash flows generated by the high prepayment activity were unable to be reinvested at a comparable interest rate 
total average loans increased million during and million during primarily due to retained loan originations and whole loan purchases 
the yield on real estate loans decreased basis points in to while increasing two basis points during to 
the largest component of the yield on real estate loans was residential loans 
due to the compression in the yield curve mentioned above  the biggest impact has been felt in the residential portfolio as evidenced by the basis point decline in the average yield during this was primarily due to the high level of refinance activity and origination volumes 
the yields on the commercial real estate and construction and land portfolios have been fairly consistent over the past two years 
the yield on consumer loans increased basis points in to while decreasing basis points during to 
the yield on the consumer loans increased during as the teaser period on various promotional home equity products expired 
in addition  the impact of the declines in the prime rate in the fourth quarter of won t be felt until early the main reason for the decline during is due to the highly competitive environment for home equity loans  causing the banks to offer lower interest rates on this product 
the yield on commercial loans decreased basis points during to and nine basis points during to 
the decline in the yield on commercial loans reflects a decline in the prime rate as well as competitive pricing pressures 
in addition  the yield on the lease financings  included in the commercial portfolio  was lower than the portfolio  thereby dragging down the overall yield 
the decline in the commercial loan yield during was primarily due to competitive pricing as well as a higher proportion of fixed rate loans 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased basis points during to and increased basis points in to 
core deposits  which include now  savings and money market accounts  usually have rates lower than those paid on certificates of deposit 
however  to grow the core deposit balances  the banks have offered promotional rates on certain products 
the impact of these promotional rates on the savings rate has been an increase of basis points in and basis points in average balances on these savings accounts  meanwhile  have grown by million and million  respectively  in and the banks have moderated the rates paid on money market accounts and had a decrease in the rate paid of basis points and an increase of only basis points  respectively  in and however  the balances maintained in money market accounts have declined in each of those years as customers have migrated to the savings account promotional products 
the balances maintained in now accounts have increased modestly in both years while the rates have remained fairly stable during that same time period 
certificate of deposit average balances decreased million and the rates paid decreased basis points during  while increasing million and basis points  respectively  in the decline in the average balances and rates paid on the certificates of deposit reflect the customers desire to migrate out of longer term deposits into core deposit or short term maturities 
the company has continued its reliance on borrowed funds as an alternative source of funds to deposits in order to grow average earning assets 
in  the average balance of borrowed funds increased million while the rate paid decreased basis points 
the decline in the rate paid on borrowed funds is due to the reduction in market interest rates that was also experienced in the investment and loan portfolios 
during  the company was successful in attracting new deposits  therefore  the average balance of borrowed funds decreased million and the rate paid decreased basis points to 
the decline in the rate paid in was partly attributable to the early extinguishment of million of borrowed funds in the third quarter of the combination of the factors mentioned above contributed to the ten basis point decline in the interest rate spread to during and a four basis point decline in the net yield on earning assets to

rate volume analysis 
the following table shows the changes in interest income and interest expense caused by changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in interest rates received and paid  respectively

the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to the statement of operations 
the allowance is reduced by a credit for loan losses as well as loan charge offs 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet probable losses in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
among the factors management may consider are the quality of specific loans  risk characteristics of the loan portfolio generally  the level of nonaccruing loans  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies  actual charge off experience  and the collateral values of the underlying security 
ultimate loan losses may vary significantly from current estimates and future additions may be necessary 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  review the banks allowance and may require the banks to provide additions to the allowance based on their assessment  which may differ from management s assessment 
the credit for loan losses in was million as compared to provisions for loan losses in and amounting to  and million  respectively 
net charge offs amounted to  in   in and million in the credit for loan losses in resulted from the continued improvement in overall loan quality  as reflected by the decline in nonaccruing loans  decline in total overdue loans and net charge offs of  the decline in the provision recorded in from reflects  among other things  a reduction in non performing assets and reduced levels of delinquencies  combined with lower levels of net charge offs 
while management believes that it has been reasonable in its analysis of the allowance for loan losses and in estimating the net fair values of other real estate owned  management is unable to predict the ultimate course of economy of the extent of its impact on the company s financial condition

non interest income 
the company recorded income from non interest sources of million in  million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to losses relating to mortgage banking activities  offset by gains on real estate operations and increased fee income on deposits and loans 
the increase of million in was primarily due to a reduction in the losses on real estate operations  higher fee income on deposits and an increase in the gains generated by the investment portfolio 
net gains from sales and redemptions of investments totaled  in and  in  as compared to net losses on sales and redemptions of  in the loss on sale of investments in was primarily due to the balance sheet restructuring whereby the company sold approximately million of low yielding investments at a loss of  and reinvested the proceeds in higher yielding assets 
see financial condition investments and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded net gains from sales of assets held for sale of  in   in and  in included in each of the three years were gains totaling   and  respectively  from the capitalization of originated mortgage servicing rights 
see financial condition loans and notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
andover may incur gains and losses on the sale of the loans that it originates 
these loans are generally securitized prior to sale in the form of mortgage backed securities which are guaranteed by a government agency and are then held for sale 
because loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or market value and mortgage backed securities held for sale are stated at fair value  periods of rising interest rates cause the values of loans and mortgage backed securities held for sale to decrease  resulting in a charge to income 
the company frequently enters into forward delivery contracts to reduce exposure to this risk from rising interest rates 
forward delivery contracts may  however  increase exposure to the risk from declining interest rates if sufficient loans or mortgage backed securities held for sale bearing interest rates specified by the contracts are not available to meet the delivery schedules under the contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage banking income represents the gross servicing fee income less amortization and provisions for the valuation allowance on the mortgage servicing assets 
the company retains as a service fee a portion of the interest paid by the borrower 
a valuation allowance was established in and the provisions charged against earnings totaled million   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and in a low interest rate environment  the underlying residential loans will repay faster than expected  causing the fair value of the mortgage servicing assets to decline as well as reduce the gross cash flows collected on a shrinking serviced portfolio 
this prepayment risk results in increased provisions and charge offs to the valuation allowance  and thus lower mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking loss totaled  in  as compared to mortgage banking income of million in and million in the gross servicing income has fluctuated over the past three years but corresponds to the level of average loans serviced for investors 
the table below summarizes the company s results from servicing loans for investors 
years ended december  in thousands gross servicing income    amortization    provisions for valuation allowance  net mortgage banking income loss   average loans serviced for investors    year end loans serviced for investors    during  and  the company purchased mortgage servicing rights to million  million and million  respectively  in residential first mortgage loans 
these purchased balances are included in the balance of loans serviced for investors 
as part of its long term business plan  the company intends to continue purchasing mortgage servicing to increase the use of its existing servicing capacity and increase loan servicing revenue when it is deemed appropriate 
the company also expects to continue selling mortgages in the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and therefore  servicing income related to this activity is accordingly expected to continue for the foreseeable future

gains on real estate operations totaled  in  compared to losses of  in and million in real estate operations consist of provisions for the valuation allowance  operating costs of maintaining other real estate owned  gains or losses on sales of properties and costs associated with the foreclosure on nonaccrual properties  less any rental income on other real estate owned 
the company accounts for other real estate owned at the lower of cost or estimated net fair value 
declines in value subsequent to foreclosure or substantive repossession result in a charge to the valuation allowance 
replenishing the valuation allowance caused by charge offs taken as a result of declines in value resulted in a credit of  in compared to a charge of  and  to real estate operations in and  respectively 
deterioration in the new england real estate market during the early s led to high levels of other real estate owned and corresponding administrative costs 
gains on sales of other real estate owned totaled  in   in and  in the costs of foreclosing on loans  as well as the administrative costs of maintaining the non performing assets  correspond with the volume of problem assets and totaled  in   in and million in see financial condition risk elements and note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was derived primarily from customer service charges and fees 
deposit account service charges  representing the largest component of such other income  totaled million in  million in and million in loan late charges and other fees increased during by  to  while remaining fairly stable in and at  and  respectively 
the fees recognized in reflect increases in both appraisal fees and miscellaneous loan fees resulting from the high level of originations 
rental income increased slightly during to  and increased in by due to vacant space becoming fully tenanted 
other income has remained relatively unchanged over the past two years and totaled  and  respectively  for and and includes income from liberty securities  ira  safe deposit and other miscellaneous charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest expense 
non interest expenses increased  or to million in non interest expenses increased million or to million in the modest increase in reflects a higher level of capitalized loan origination costs resulting from the high level of originations as well as the company s continued attempts at cost containment while the increase in is primarily due to operating a larger institution 
this has resulted in higher staffing levels  an increased number of branches and alternative delivery systems  and growth in the number of loans and deposits 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  increased  to million in and increased million in to million 
the increase in was primarily due to increased benefits offset by higher levels of capitalized loan origination costs while the increase in was primarily due to increased staffing  merit increases and increased costs associated with the various benefits programs offered by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
office occupancy and equipment increased  to million in and increased  in to million 
the increased in was primarily due to increased rental expense resulting from rental increases and more properties leased from third parties 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes  reflecting an increase in the values of company owned properties as well as an increase in service maintenance contracts on various equipment owned by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
data processing expenses totaled million in  million in and million in data processing expenses increased  in and  in due to a higher loan and deposit base resulting from the purchase of loans and mortgage loan servicing and internally generated loan and deposit growth 
in addition  the introduction of alternative delivery systems  via customers computers  debit cards and by a telephone service center  have caused overall processing costs to increase in each of the two years 
the level of data processing expenses incurred in and on behalf of the company s effort in its yk compliance have not been material 
see financial condition year readiness disclosure 
professional fees  including corporate legal and accounting and auditing expenses  totaled  in   in and million in professional fees increased  in due to increased consulting and corporate legal expenses 
the decline of  in was due to a reduction in various consulting services incurred in conjunction with tax planning projects undertaken in marketing expenses totaled  in   in and  in marketing expenses decreased  in due to a reduction in the number of discretionary promotions as compared to being fairly stable over the prior two years 
mortgage banking expenses totaled  in   in and  in costs included in mortgage banking expenses are commissions and related expenses paid to the mortgage loan originators  net of any deferred origination expenses  and costs associated with servicing the portfolio for outside investors 
the expenses increased substantially in and reflect the increased volume of originations while increasing modestly in due to a larger servicing portfolio 
other operating expenses totaled million in  million in and million in the increases of  in and  in are primarily due to running a larger organization 
this is reflected in more loan and deposit accounts  higher staffing levels and more branches and locations in each of the two years 
correspondingly  increases result from higher postage expenses  office supplies and printing costs as well as telephone costs and increased contributions 
included in the other operating expense for is the recovery of  from the execution termination agreement  thereby contributing to the significant increase in federal and state income tax expense 
the company recorded tax expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and realized effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in pretax income offset by million tax benefit resulting from the favorable resolution of several tax issues that had previously been fully reserved against 
the increase of million in was mainly due to a one time benefit of million recorded in  combined with an increase in pretax income in recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the provision of enacted tax laws and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates 
management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred income tax asset will reverse in periods in which the company generates net taxable income 
for the years ending december    and  the company generated taxable income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
taxable income differs from pretax book income primarily as a result of loan losses and provision for losses on other real estate owned being recognized in a different period than for book income 
the company recorded a reduction of the valuation allowance of  in and  in both and the amount recognized in was due to the expiration of subsidiary net operating loss carry forwards while the amounts recognized in and were due to increased recoverable federal income taxes 
at december   the net deferred tax asset is supported by recoverable income taxes of approximately million 
management believes that the net deferred income tax asset at december  will be realized based upon the significant reduction in the level of non performing assets over the past several years 
it should be noted  however  that factors beyond management s control  such as the general state of the economy and real estate values  can affect future levels of taxable income and that no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible temporary differences

financial condition total assets increased million  or  to  million at december  the growth in total assets was primarily due to an increase of million in total loans 
total assets at december  amounted to  million  an increase of million or from  million at december   resulting primarily from an increase in total loans of million  offset by a modest decline in the investment portfolio 
loans total loans at december   prior to the allowance for loan losses  amounted to  million compared with million at december   an increase of million or  primarily due to internally generated loan growth combined with purchases of million in residential whole loans 
at december   of andover s total loan portfolio consisted of loans with adjustable rates as compared to at december  the following table shows the composition of the company s loan portfolio at the dates indicated

     net loans      total real estate loans increased million in to million at december   primarily due to the increase in real estate loan originations of million 
origination volumes are sensitive to market rates  particularly in the refinancing arena 
as can be determined by the following table  total loan originations were the highest in  the year with the lowest interest rates 
total loan originations were strong in and due to a favorable interest rate environment while loan originations dropped in due to the higher interest rates existing during most of that year 
residential loan originations totaled million in  million in and million in these originations are not fully reflected in loans outstanding due to the securitization  regular amortization and prepayments of residential real estate loans 
the majority of the company s residential loans are underwritten to be eligible for sale in the secondary market 
andover sells most of the eligible year fixed rate loans it originates 
a loan which the company intends to sell may be sold directly or converted into mortgage backed securities and sold in that form 
residential loans sold directly amounted to million in  million in and million in those sold in the form of mortgage backed securities held for sale or available for sale totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and the portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the following table shows the composition of the company s loan originations and loan purchases for the years indicated years ended december  in thousands retail loans residential fixed rate loans      residential variable rate loans      total residential originations      home equity line of credit      other consumer      total consumer originations      total retail originations      corporate loans commercial real estate loans      construction and land loans      commercial loans      lease financing  total corporate originations      residential whole loan purchases     total loan originations and purchases      outstanding commercial loans increased million in to million at december  commercial real estate loans increased million in to million at december   while construction and land loan balances increased million to million in the same period 
while originations of corporate loans  comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans and lease financings  are sensitive to the interest rate environment  the capacity for borrowing  current and anticipated economic conditions and real estate values have a more critical role 
origination volume for these loans has increased substantially in  reflecting stabilizing values and the company s interest in corporate lending 
however  due to the highly competitive market for these loans  the origination volume slipped slightly in but does not represent a reduction in the company s interest or capacity for these types of loans 
total originations of corporate loans were million in  million in and million in loans transferred into real estate owned totaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
commercial real estate  construction and land  commercial loans and lease financings involve significant risks compared with single family residential mortgage and consumer lending 
see item  business lending activities 
consumer loans outstanding decreased  or million to million at december   from million at year end a large component of the decline during resulted from the sale of student loans totaling million 
during  the level of originations for home equity lines of credit decreased due to the strong first mortgage refinance activity 
this refinance activity also reduced the outstanding balances on the home equity lines as they would be combined into a single new mortgage 
during  the company continued to aggressively price its home equity lines of credit and was able to keep originations of these loans in excess of million in both and other consumer loans include secured student loans  collateral loans and second mortgage loans 
originations of consumer loans are also sensitive to changes in the interest rate environment 
risk elements the following table shows the composition of non performing assets at december dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans      other real estate owned    total non performing assets      total non performing assets as a percentage of total assets 
during  continued progress was made in reducing non performing assets with a reduction of million or  primarily due to a reduction of nonaccruing loans 
andover had experienced a sharp increase in the level of non performing assets and a corresponding rise in foregone income  loan losses and other costs associated with non performing assets beginning in due to the deteriorating new england real estate market and economy 
a significant portion of andover s non performing assets are secured by mixed use commercial and multi family real estate located in lawrence  massachusetts 
this city had been especially hard hit with declining real estate values and increasing vacancies in multi family  investor owned properties  which represents the majority of andover s collateral on troubled loans in lawrence 
continued deterioration in this market area will adversely impact the collectibility of residential and commercial real estate loans and may result in an increased level of non performing assets in at december   approximately million of nonaccruing loans were secured by properties located in lawrence 
a majority of the remaining accruing loans at year end in lawrence were secured by residential properties 
the amount of accruing loans secured by properties in lawrence totaled approximately million at december  at december   total impaired loans were million  of which  had related allowances of  and million which did not require a related impairment allowance 
all of the million in impaired loans have been measured using the fair value of the collateral method 
during the period ended december   the average recorded value of impaired loans was million and the related amount of interest income recognized was the impact of existing non performing assets on future interest income will be largely dependent upon converting these assets to earning status  either through a return to performing status or through foreclosure and subsequent disposition of the property 
it is expected that the level of foreclosures and related expenses will continue to impact earnings in see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
nonaccruing loans 
management places loans  regardless of collateral values  on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against current period interest income when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
when collection procedures do not bring a loan to performing status  andover generally institutes action to foreclose upon the property or to acquire it by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
loans for which payments are less than days past due are placed on nonaccrual status where there exists serious doubt as to the ultimate collectibility of the loan

allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans during  loans on nonaccrual decreased to million  throughout all loan categories 
interest income of approximately  would have been recorded in on nonaccruing loans if those loans had been on a current basis in accordance with their original terms 
interest income actually recognized in on nonaccruing loans amounted to approximately  additionally  another  in interest payments were received on nonaccruing loans during and applied as a reduction of the loan balance instead of as interest income 
restructured loans 
a restructured loan is one for which the bank has modified the terms to provide a temporary reduction in the rate of interest below the prevailing market interest rates at the time of modification and  in most instances  an extension of payments of principal or interest or both due to the deterioration in the financial position of the borrowers 
restructured loans are not returned to performing status until the obligation has performed for a reasonable period of time  its ultimate collectibility is no longer in doubt and is at a market rate of interest 
restructured loans totaled million at december  there were no restructured loans at december  other real estate owned

the valuation allowance represents management s estimate of the net fair value of other real estate owned 
the following table shows the composition of other real estate owned at december dollars in thousands other real estate owned    valuation allowance total other real estate owned

the following table summarizes the activity in andover s allowance for loan losses during the five years ended december dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year      balance of acquired institution  provision credit for loan losses    charge offs residential real estate   commercial real estate   construction and land commercial consumer total charge offs      recoveries residential real estate commercial real estate construction and land commercial consumer total recoveries    net charge offs    balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to at december   from and at december  and  respectively  due to a credit for loan losses taken during management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
see results of operations provision for loan losses 
management measures the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses by assigning loans into risk categories based on a loan classification system modelled after the bank regulatory classification system 
while management believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover potential losses  there are uncertainties regarding future events 
deterioration in the real estate market or economy may result in additional nonaccruing loans  charge offs and a need for provisions for loan losses to maintain an adequate allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the banks allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the banks to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various categories of the portfolio is also made periodically  based on management s judgment in weighing various factors  including the quality of specific loans  the level of nonaccruing loans in the various categories  current economic conditions  trends in delinquencies and prior charge offs  and the collateral value of the underlying security 
because the allowance for loan losses is based on various estimates  including loan collectibility and real estate values  and includes a high degree of judgment  subsequent changes in the general economic prospects of the borrowers may require changes in those estimates 
the changes in the allowance allocated to each category of loan directly corresponds to the level of nonaccrual loans and adversely classified loans as well as the level of outstanding loans 
andover historically has experienced lower losses in its residential mortgage loan portfolio and  therefore  allocations applicable to this portfolio are lower

the primary objectives are to provide interest and dividend income  to ensure adequate liquidity and achieve an acceptable asset liability gap position while diversifying the asset mix 
the investment portfolio is also evaluated in comparison to returns that are earned by the loan portfolio 
the primary component of the total investment portfolio is mortgage backed securities  which accounted for of total investments at december  the remaining portion of the total investment portfolio consists of us government and federal agency obligations  corporate bonds  short term investments in federal funds sold  and other investment grade securities 
us government and federal agency obligations represent the fastest growing component of the investment portfolio and totaled as of december   as compared to at year end all of the mortgage backed securities represent undivided interests in pools of mortgages which have been formed into pass through securities and sold to investors by the government national mortgage association gnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fnma 
securities issued by gnma  a wholly owned us government corporation  are fully guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest 
securities issued by fhlmc and fnma  government sponsored corporations  carry each corporation s guarantee as to the timely payment of interest and the ultimate payment of principal 
cash flows from the underlying mortgages of all mortgage backed securities are passed through to andover in the form of monthly payments of interest  scheduled principal amortization  and prepayments of mortgage balances 
these securities  therefore  have unpredictable cash flows

such securities are recorded at amortized cost 
trading securities are debt and equity securities held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term 
the company does not have any securities designated as trading securities 
such securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in earnings 
investments available for sale are any debt or equity security not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities 
investments available for sale are recorded at their fair value with changes in fair values recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of related income taxes

there was an increase in the total unrealized gain of  in the investment portfolio  from a net unrealized gain of million at december  to million at december   resulting from a decrease in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates and their impact on the unrealized gain or loss in the investment portfolio are not material factors in the company s overall investment strategy 
this is largely due to the fact that neither the changes nor their impact can be controlled by the company 
additionally  investment purchases are often match funded by long term advances in order to achieve a consistent spread on a particular investment 
the following table presents unrealized gains and losses by major categories of securities at december  the net unrealized gains of million on investments available for sale is included in stockholders equity  net of applicable income taxes at december  at that date  andover s net unrealized gains on investments held to maturity amounted to million

the growth of million and million for and  respectively  has been primarily due to the introduction of a tiered savings product offering customers a premium rate on balances in excess of  this premium product represents more than half of the savings account balances 
the growth in the balances of demand deposits and now accounts reflects the high levels of activity resulting from the refinance activity in the residential mortgages 
the decline in each of the past two years in money market accounts is primarily due to a shift in customer preference for the premium savings account 
in the current low interest rate environment  depositors are shifting from longer maturity term deposits into core deposit accounts without fixed maturities or into shorter maturity term deposits 
the bank believes that this trend will continue into as long as interest rates remain at these relatively low rates

during the third quarter of  the bank elected early prepayment of million of above market interest rate fhlb advances as part of a balance sheet restructuring 
the bank incurred a pre tax loss of  or  net of tax  on this transaction  however  by repurchasing new advances  the bank was able to reduce the effective rate from approximately down to less than see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
asset and liability management and market risk the banks earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the company seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by andover s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the banks market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and preserve capital  while adjusting the company s asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
the company relies primarily on its asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the following two tables reflect different methods of disclosing the company s exposure to a change in interest rates and its potential impact on the company s net interest income 
the gap analysis uses estimated prepayments  contractual maturities and next repricing dates while the market risk analysis excludes the next repricing dates 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities in both tables would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions provided 
one method used to measure the interest rate risk exposure is the company s gap analysis  which involves comparing the difference between assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during a given period of time 
these differences are a primary component of the risk to net interest income 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
the following table illustrates the company s gap position  or the estimated maturity and repricing structure of its interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  at december  days days years years years total dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets fixed rate securities       variable rate securities    fixed rate loans       variable rate loans       other interest sensitive assets   total interest sensitive assets       interest sensitive liabilities now accounts       savings and money market deposit accounts       certificates of deposit      total borrowed funds       total interest sensitive liabilities

fixed rate residential mortgage loans are shown in the table in the time period corresponding to scheduled principal amortization and anticipated prepayments using annual conditional prepayment rates that vary from to at december   as compared with to at december  mortgage backed securities are allocated using annual conditional prepayment rates of to at december   versus to at december  all other loans and securities  certificates of deposit and borrowed funds are allocated to the period in which the rates could be next adjusted or to their final contractual maturity for the fixed rate instruments 
substantially all of the callable advances from the fhlb are allocated according to their contractual maturity due to the unlikelihood of their being called by the fhlb given current market interest rates 
other interest sensitive assets include assets held for sale and fhlb stock 
nonaccruing loans have been excluded from both the gap analysis and the market risk analysis 
a substantial portion of the savings  money market and now accounts are considered core deposits by management and  therefore  relatively insensitive to interest rates 
in addition  any future changes to the interest rates paid on these accounts are at the sole discretion of management 
despite the foregoing factors  these deposits have been allocated between each time period based on the banks own historical experience  or decay rates  in determining the deposit runoff 
another method used to measure interest rate risk is the market risk analysis 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  expected maturity date as of december  fair value at thereafter total dollars in millions interest sensitive assets fixed rate securities average interest rate variable rate securities average interest rate fixed rate retail loans average interest rate variable rate retail loans average interest rate fixed rate corporate loans average interest rate variable rate corporate loans average interest rate other interest sensitive assets average interest rate total interest sensitive assets   interest sensitive liabilities now accounts average interest rate savings money market deposit accounts average interest rate certificates of deposit average interest rate total borrowed funds average interest rate total interest sensitive liabilities   as of december  total interest sensitive assets   total interest sensitive liabilities   market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
expected maturities are contractual maturities adjusted for prepayments of principal 
the company uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for interest sensitive assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal using the same ratios used for the gap analysis presented above 
however  as mentioned above  the market rise analysis excludes repricing features on all interest sensitive assets 
retail loans include residential and consumer loans while corporate loans are comprised of commercial real estate  commercial  construction and land loans and leases 
for interest sensitive liabilities  the same decay rates and contractual maturities used for the gap analysis are used for the market risk analysis 
the only difference between the two analyses on the interest sensitive liabilities are the callable features on the fhlb advances  the market risk analysis uses the advances contractual maturity dates in all cases 
the following table reflects the scheduled maturities of selected loans at december  one over less than through five one year five years years total in thousands construction and land loans    commercial loans    of the loans maturing after one year  million  or  have fixed rates and million  or  have floating or variable rates

the banks have a diverse base of funding 
sources of liquidity include maturation  amortization and prepayment of the investment and loan portfolios 
another source of liquidity is funds purchased from other banks  the sale of securities under repurchase agreements  customer repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the fhlb  of which andover bank is a voluntary member 
the banks may also obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston by pledging certain assets 
at december   the company had home equity  reserve credit and commercial unadvanced lines of credit totaling million 
outstanding commitments to originate loans totaled million 
unadvanced portions of construction and land loans amounted to million 
standby letters of credit were million 
loans sold with recourse totaled million 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet these commitments if and as called upon 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased by million to at december   and decreased by million to million at december  the change in was primarily attributable to an increase in net income coupled with a credit for loan losses 
the change in was primarily due to a reduced provision for loan losses and an increase in assets held for sale 
cash flows used by investing activities decreased by million to million during and increased million during to million 
the increase in was due to a reduction in the purchases of whole loans 
the increase in was attributable to a reduction in sales of investments available for sale combined with a million increase in whole loans purchased during the year 
cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by million to million during due to a smaller increase in deposits 
the increase of million to million during was mainly attributable to an increase in total deposits 
capital resources at december   the company reported total capital of million  or of total assets as compared to million  or at december  the company and the banks continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of all applicable regulatory minimums

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on operations of andover is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
year readiness disclosure the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
this section contains certain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume  plan  and other similar expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  the company s expectations as to when it will complete the modification and testing phases of its year project plan as well as its year contingency plans  its estimated cost of achieving year readiness  and the company s belief that its internal systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
the company s readiness for the year  and the eventual effects of the year on the company may be materially different than currently projected 
this may be due to  among other things  unanticipated delays and expenses in the completion of the company s year initiative  the availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  the failure of its proposed contingency plans  if such contingency plans become necessary  to achieve their desired result and the failure of governmental agencies and third parties with whom the company has a significant business relationship to achieve year readiness 
the year computer software compliance issues affect andover and many other financial institutions and companies in the us historically  certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable years 
as a result  software may recognize a date using the two digits as rather than the year computer programs that do not recognize the proper date could generate erroneous data or cause systems to fail 
the company started its year initiative in early the company has completed its assessment of year issues  developed a plan  tested its various software information systems  hardware components and non technology systems and arranged for the required human and financial resources to complete its necessary remediation efforts 
the company has substantially completed the remediating  testing and returning to production all of its critical applications in accordance with its original plan as of december  testing of the company s non critical applications will continue into and will be completed prior to any anticipated impact of the year issue on its operating systems 
the company has considered various contingency plans for its critical applications  including the possibility of obtaining alternative vendors or replacement systems 
based on its assessment of their progress to date  the company has determined to rely on the ability of the company s service bureau and other critical vendors to achieve year readiness 
this assessment has included multiple visits with the company s service bureau  discussions with the other critical vendors  reviewing each vendor s compliance in meeting its own targeted deadlines as well as continuously monitoring each vendor by the company 
in addition  the company has actively participated in the testing of its critical applications in conjunction with its significant vendors 
however  contingency plans beyond this reliance on vendor compliance have not been established in the event that these critical vendors are unable to achieve year readiness 
the company has worked on a number of alternative solutions for their non technology systems such as heat  electric and telephone services 
this has involved seeking alternative vendors and sources such as generators to provide heat in case of an electric failure or cellular phones in lieu of traditional phone lines 
should the company s worst case scenario  the loss of electric power  occur  the company will have in place an electric generator at its main office 
this will allow the company to continue to run its core operating system 
transactions that would be performed at a number of the company s locations would then have to be transported to the main office for input 
this would continue until such time as normal electric power is restored 
the company will continue to utilize both internal and external resources to update  or replace  develop and test all software information systems and hardware components for year modifications 
included in other noninterest expenses are charges incurred in connection with the modification or replacement of software and hardware in order for the company s computer systems to properly recognize the year expenses 
the expenses incurred and hardware capitalized totaled approximately  for the year ended december  the company expects that the majority of the costs that will be incurred as discussed below will be to replace or upgrade existing hardware and software which will be capitalized and amortized in accordance with the company s existing accounting policy while miscellaneous consulting  maintenance and modification costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company continues to evaluate the estimated costs associated with achieving year readiness based on its experience to date 
based on current estimates  the remaining costs of its efforts to achieve year readiness are not expected to exceed  however  no assurance can be given that the company or the third party vendors to whom the company outsources its information systems will solve such issues in a successful and timely fashion or that the costs of such efforts will not exceed current estimates 
if the company does not solve such issues  or does not do so in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  future operating results and financial condition 
bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance under which they are assessing year readiness 
the failure of a financial institution  such as andover  to take appropriate action to address year issues may result in enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on such institution  result in the imposition of civil money penalties  or result in the delay of applications seeking to acquire other entities or otherwise expand the institution s activities 
recent accounting developments in june   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for all quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  early application is encouraged but restatement of prior periods is prohibited 
sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company
