general development of business konover property trust  inc the company  formerly fac realty trust  inc  was incorporated on march  as a self administrated and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the company is principally engaged in the acquisition  development  operation  and ownership of retail shopping centers 
the company s revenues are primarily derived under real estate leases with national  regional and local retailing companies 
over the past five years  the company has grown from an owner of retail outlet shopping centers with an aggregate square footage of million to an owner of approximately million square feet of diversified retail space consisting of community shopping centers in states aggregating approximately  square feet  outlet centers in states aggregating approximately  square feet  two centers aggregating approximately  square feet that are held for sale  and approximately acres of outparcel land located near or adjacent to certain of the company s centers and which are being marketed for lease or sale 
significant transactions and acquisitions upreit conversion on december   following shareholder approval  the company changed its domicile from the state of delaware to the state of maryland 
the reincorporation was accomplished through the merger of fac realty  inc into its maryland subsidiary  konover property trust  inc formerly fac realty trust  inc 
following the reincorporation on december   the company reorganized as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust an upreit 
the company then contributed to kpt properties  lp formerly fac properties  lp  a delaware limited partnership the operating partnership  all of its assets and liabilities 
in exchange for the company s assets  the company received limited partnership interests units in the operating partnership in an amount and designation that corresponded to the number and designation of outstanding shares of capital stock of the company at the time 
the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership 
as additional limited partners are admitted to the operating partnership in exchange for the contribution of properties  the company s percentage ownership in the operating partnership will decline 
as the company issues additional shares of capital stock  it will contribute the proceeds for that capital stock to the operating partnership in exchange for a number of units equal to the number of shares that the company issues 
the company conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets through the operating partnership either directly or through subsidiaries such that a unit is economically equivalent to a share of the company s common stock 
an upreit may allow the company to offer units in the operating partnership in exchange for ownership interests from tax motivated sellers 
under certain circumstances  the exchange of units for a seller s ownership interest will enable the operating partnership to acquire assets while allowing the seller to defer the tax liability associated with the sale of such assets 
effectively  this allows the company to use units instead of stock to acquire properties  which provides an advantage over many other potential buyers of property

impact of year issue general 
the year compliance issue concerns the inability of computer systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
the year issue  if not corrected  could result in the failure of the information technology it systems that the company uses in its business operations  such as computer programs related to property management  leasing  financial reporting and employee benefits 
in addition  computerized systems and microprocessors are embedded in a variety of products used in the company s operations and properties  such as hvac controls  thermostats  lights  elevators  alarms  smoke detectors  sprinklers and phones 
state of readiness 
the company has completed an assessment of its computer information technology systems and is now taking the further necessary steps to make such systems year compliant 
in addition  the company has completed an evaluation and assessment on its non it systems which include embedded technology such as microcontrollers 
the company s primary use of software systems is its corporate accounting system 
the company s corporate accounting system is widely used in the real estate industry  however  it is not fully year compliant 
the company is replacing its current corporate accounting system with a new software system  which is year compliant 
this new software is also widely used in the real estate industry 
the implementation of the essential components of the new software system is complete  with planned enhancements to the system proceeding on schedule 
the company had previously planned the system conversion  and such changes would have been undertaken without regard to year remediation issues 
accordingly  the company has not deferred any planned information or software projects due to such year projects 
with respect to the company s it systems  overall  the company is complete in terms of labor with the renovation and validation phases of its remediation plan 
completion of the plan is expected by august  with respect to non it systems  the company has completed all three phases assessment  renovation and validation of its remediation plan 
as discussed above at recent developments  the company has agreed to acquire rmc realty companies  a management and leasing company in tampa  florida 
in connection with its due diligence  the company has completed its assessment of rmc s year issues 
renovation and validation is expected to be completed during the second quarter of with respect to year issues relating to third parties with which we have a material relationship  we have sought representations from all tenants representing more than of our annualized revenue 
no tenant is expected to contribute more than of our annualized revenue in such tenants do not expect to be materially affected by year issues 
with respect to suppliers and vendors  the company s material purchases are from those in competitive fields where others will be able to meet any company needs unmet by suppliers or vendors with year difficulties 
because of the company s lack of dependence on any one tenant  supplier or vendor and the favorable responses received from our inquires to significant tenants  the company has not developed a contingency plan for dealing with third party year failures 
costs 
to date  the costs directly associated the company s year efforts have not been material  and we estimate our future costs to be immaterial as well 
risks associated with the year issue 
we do not expect year failures to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity because we do not rely on a small number of tenants for a significant portion of our rental revenue and our largest tenants do not expect to be materially affected by year failures 
we stand ready to switch vendors or suppliers whose year failures adversely affect their products or services  and our remediation plan is expected to be complete prior to the year nevertheless  this forward looking statement depends on numerous factors  such as the continued provision of utility services  and the company remains exposed to the risk of year failures 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements below 
various of the company s disclosures and announcements concerning its year programs are intended to constitute year readiness disclosures as defined in the recently enacted year information and readiness disclosure act 
the act provides added protection from liability for certain public and private statements concerning an entity s year readiness and the year readiness of its products and services 
the act also potentially provides added protection from liability for certain types of year disclosures made after january   and before the date of enactment of the act 
economic conditions inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years with certain segments of the economy experiencing disinflation  such as apparel sales 
disinflation in this market segment has slowed the growth of tenant sales  which adversely affects the company s revenue due to lower percentage and overage rents on some properties 
additionally  weakness in the overall retail environment as it relates to tenant sales volumes may have an impact on the company s ability to renew leases at current rental rates or to re lease space to other tenants 
a decline in sales does not affect base rent  aside from renewals 
but sales declines could result in reduced revenue from percentage rent tenants  as well as overage rent paid to the company 
both revenue items are directly impacted by sales volumes and represented of the company s total revenue for the year ended december  continuation of this trend may affect the company s operating centers occupancy rate  rental rates  and concessions  if any  granted on new leases or re leases of space 
this in turn may cause fluctuations in the cash flow from the operation and performance of the operating centers
