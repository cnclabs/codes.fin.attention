impact of inflation inflation has not affected the company  as it has generally been able to pass along inflationary increases in its costs through increased sales prices 
year in prior years  certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these programs were written without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century and may experience problems handling dates beyond the year this could cause certain computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the company has been executing a plan to identify and address any possible deficiencies that the year issue may have on its computer systems  which include both proprietary and third party computer systems  related hardware  software and data and telephone networks and information systems service providers 
this plan addresses the year issue in multiple phases including i identification of critical systems  vendors and third party administrators that may be vulnerable to system failures or processing errors as a result of year issues  ii assessment and prioritization of identified risks associated with the failure to be year compliant  iii testing of systems to determine year compliance  iv remediation and implementation of systems and equipment  and v contingency planning to assess reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
as of march  the company has completed phases i and ii  and is approximately complete with phases iii and iv  referred to above 
phase v will be addressed in the upcoming months 
project plans call for the completion of the solution implementation phase and testing of those solutions by the end of  prior to any anticipated impact on the company s systems 
the company is dependent on basic public infrastructure  such as telecommunications and utilities  in order to function normally 
significant long term interruptions of this infrastructure could have an adverse effect on the operations of the company 
additionally  the company must rely on assurances from suppliers and vendors that their information systems and key services will be year compliant 
the company is in the process of evaluating each major supplier  vendor and third party administrator to assess their year readiness and initiatives 
as of march  the company is approximately complete with the process and anticipates completion by the end of while the company plans to validate representations from these parties  it cannot be sure that their tests will be adequate  or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed in a timely and satisfactory manner 
even if the company  in a timely manner  completes all of its assessments  implements and tests all remediation plans it believes to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences or business interruptions to the company 
furthermore  there may be certain third parties such as utilities  telecommunications companies  or vendors where alternative arrangements or sources are limited or unavailable 
the company has not yet determined the extent of contingency planning that may be required as this is dependent on completion of these ongoing assessments of its vendors  suppliers and third party administrators 
the extent and magnitude of the year issue is difficult to predict or quantify for a number of reasons including the lack of control over third party systems and complexities associated with testing interconnected systems networks and applications 
the company expects that the maximum external cost which could be incurred in conjunction with the testing and remediation of all hardware and software systems and applications is approximately  through completion in  of which  approximately  has been incurred to date 
such costs have been and will be funded by the company s operating cash flows 
this estimate of maximum costs does not include the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of year related failures that occur despite the company s implementation of the year plan 
the cost of the company s plan to address the year issue and the anticipated date on which the company plans to complete the necessary year conversion efforts are based on management s best estimates  which were derived from numerous assumptions of future events  including the availability of resources  vendor remediation plans  and other factors 
although the company is not currently aware of any material operational issues associated with preparing its systems for the year  or material issues with respect to the adequacy of major vendors  suppliers or third party administrators systems  there can be no assurance  due to the overall complexity of the year issue  that the company will not experience material unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in such systems or by the company s failure to adequately prepare for the results of such errors or defects  including costs or related litigation  if any 
such consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
