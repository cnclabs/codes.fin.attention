in the following discussion  fiscal   and refer to the twelve months ended march    and  respectively 
results of operations product sales for fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in product sales for both fiscal over fiscal and fiscal over fiscal reflects primarily the increase in unit sales of the company s new p active r family of products  offset by a decline in demand for some of the older semiconductor products

liquidity and capital resources unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and short term securities were million at march  compared to million at march  receivables decreased to million at march  compared to million at march  this decrease occurred partly because fourth quarter fiscal product sales were million higher than the fiscal fourth quarter  partially because a greater proportion of sales shipped in the last two months of fiscal as compared to fiscal  and partly due to the reduction of receivables over days past due as of march  as compared to march  inventories were million at march  as compared to million at march  due to an increased finished goods offset by reduced raw materials and work in process 
the increase in finished goods was in part due to new products and in part due to customers rescheduling into fiscal certain orders originally built in anticipation of shipment in the fiscal fourth quarter 
property  plant and equipment decreased to million at march  compared to million at march  capital expenditures were million in fiscal but depreciation and amortization was million 
the company made significant expenditures in fiscal to upgrade its manufacturing operations and management information systems as well as to buy out previously leased equipment  resulting in higher depreciation expense in subsequent years

see footnote there were no bank borrowings at march    and and there were no borrowings during fiscal   and the company is in compliance with its financial covenants 
the company expects to fund its future liquidity needs through its existing cash balances  cash flows from operations  bank borrowings  and equipment lease and loan financing arrangements 
depending on market conditions and the results of operations  the company may pursue other sources of liquidity 
the company believes that it has sufficient financial resources to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months 
impact of year many computer systems employ a two digit date field and could experience problems beyond the year also  some systems assign special meaning to certain dates  such as  and the year is a leap year  which some systems may not recognize 
the company has evaluated its management information systems mis and has developed a plan  as described herein  to convert all of its mis applications to year compliant versions by march  this plan is intended to encompass all major categories of systems in use by the company  including manufacturing  sales  finance and human resources 
california micro devices utilizes software packages supplied by outside vendors for all of its mission critical applications 
these software vendors have supplied the company with versions of their software that they have certified to be year compliant 
however  the company recognizes that relying on certification statements alone could potentially place its systems at risk if some level of integration and system level testing is not also performed 
to ensure that these applications work in camd s environment  the company has completed a consolidated  system level test plan that incorporated testing each of the key applications 
the positive results of these tests have allowed the company to proceed with its migration plan to year compliant systems and the company was fully converted as of march  as a result of the above progress  the company has not formulated formal contingency plans regarding conversion to year compliant critical systems 
should any unforeseen difficulties arise in the implementation of these software packages  the company would convert to alternate software packages 
the company has completed its evaluation of computers and software utilized in its manufacturing operations 
nothing has come to the attention of the company that would indicate a material impact of year issues on the company s results of operation or financial condition 
the company has substantially completed its evaluation of the possible impact of year issues on its key suppliers and subcontractors 
part of this evaluation was performed based upon representations received from those key suppliers and subcontractors 
noncompliance with year issues on the part of key suppliers and subcontractors could result in disruption of the company s operations 
nothing has come to the attention of the company that would indicate a material impact on the company as a result of year issues at its key suppliers and subcontractors 
however  the potential impact and related costs are not known at this time 
the company s products are not date sensitive 
the out of pocket expenditures incurred to date related to these programs are less than  the company currently expects that the total incremental expenditures of these programs will not exceed  most of these expenditures involve new capital equipment that will be amortized over a three to five year period 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with the company s internal systems or its products 
because the company has less control over assessing and remediating the year problems of third parties  the company believes the risks are greatest in the areas of utility services  telecommunications  transportation supply chains and critical suppliers of materials 
due to the large number of variables involved  the company cannot provide an estimate of the damage it might suffer if any of these scenarios were to occur 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company owns financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve the company s cash until it is required to fund operations and capital investments 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the company does not own derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio contains instruments that are subject to fluctuation in interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio includes debt instruments that are primarily united stated government bonds  high grade corporate bonds and money market funds of less than one year in duration 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
the company s investment portfolio also consists of certain commercial paper that is also subject to interest rate risk 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk
