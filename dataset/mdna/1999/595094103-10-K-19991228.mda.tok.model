item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in customer demand  our ability to manage our growth  risks associated with competition and risks identified in our most recent securities and exchange commission filings  including  but not limited to  those discussed in this form k under the heading risk factors 
overview micromuse develops  markets and supports a family of scalable  highly configurable  rapidly deployable software solutions that enable fault and slm 
the company was founded in in london  england  and initially operated a systems integration business  reselling computer hardware and software products and providing consulting services  principally for managing networks 
leveraging our expertise in network management  we developed our netcool omnibus software  which we began shipping in january in march  the company was reorganized in delaware and relocated its headquarters from london to san francisco 
in connection with the reorganization  we raised million through the sale of equity securities and arranged a million credit facility 
in september  we raised an additional million through the sale of equity securities and sold our systems integration business for approximately  net of fees 
in order to further the growth of the netcool business  we completed an initial public offering of common stock on february   raising approximately million  net of fees and expenses 
with the proceeds from the financings and the sale of the systems integration business  we expanded operations and substantially increased development  sales and administrative headcount for the netcool business 
on july   we completed a follow on offering of common stock  raising approximately million  net of fees and expenses 
to accommodate recent growth  to compete effectively and manage future growth  if any  we will be required to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our workforce 
our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the operations associated with our systems integration business 
in connection with such sale  the purchaser indemnified us for work in process under existing contracts  warranty claims under completed contracts and maintenance agreements  but we retained liability for completed contracts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information concerning this restatement 
other than those from discontinued operations  all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool related revenues will continue to account for all or substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of our netcool products and enhancements thereto 
as of september   we had licensed our netcool products to more than customers worldwide 
we license our software through our direct sales force  oems and value added resellers 
license revenues from oems and resellers combined  which are recognized upon the shipment to the oems and value added reseller  accounted for approximately  and of our total license revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
our ability to achieve significant additional revenue growth in the future will depend substantially on our success in recruiting and training sufficient sales and technical services personnel  maintaining our current distribution relationships and establishing additional relationships with oems  resellers and systems integrators 
as a result of our multinational operations and sales  our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies  particularly the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
for example  while our united states headquarters is located in san francisco  california  our principal product development operations are located in london  england 
as a result  a substantial portion of our costs and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  license  maintenance and service revenues outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
subsequent event on november   the company entered into  and subsequently closed  an agreement to acquire calvin alexander networking  inc can  a privately held company that develops leading edge network auto discovery technology 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  micromuse will issue approximately million worth of its common stock to acquire can  based on the closing price on november  the transaction is to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is to be treated as a tax free reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
certain agreements have been made to promote the retention and motivation of can employees 
a portion of the consideration for the transaction is subject to a one year lock up agreement and a one year price guarantee 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues  except as indicated year ended september  as a percentage of total revenues revenues license maintenance and services total revenues cost of revenues license maintenance and services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative executive recruiting costs total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other income loss before income taxes income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations gain on disposition net income loss accretion on redeemable convertible preferred stock net income loss applicable to holders of common stock as a percentage of related revenues cost of license revenues cost of maintenance and services revenues revenues our total revenues are derived from license revenues for our netcool family of products  as well as associated maintenance  consulting and training services revenues 
license revenues are recognized upon the acceptance of a purchase order and shipment of the software provided that the fee is fixed and determinable  the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
allowances for credit losses and for estimated future returns are provided for upon shipment 
credit losses and returns to date have not been material 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically twelve months 
payments for maintenance fees on initial order or on renewal are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
revenues for consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have recognized revenue  for all periods prior to and including september   in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
entitled software revenue recognition 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  we have recognized revenue in accordance with aicpa sop no 
entitled software revenue recognition 
there was no material change to our accounting for revenue as a result of the adoption of aicpa sop no 
our total revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal license revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of product licenses sold and in average transaction size  reflecting the increased acceptance of netcool omnibus  the expansion of our sales organization and the growing sales of netcool internet service monitors  netcool impact and netcool reporter 
maintenance and services revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  as a result of providing maintenance and services to a larger installed base in each successive year 
the percentage of our total revenues attributable to software was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance and services revenues accounted for  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenues from us operations were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  reflecting the expansion of our us operations 
international revenues include all revenues other than those from the united states 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
to date  our revenues have resulted primarily from sales to the telecommunications industry  isps and investment banks 
license revenues from telecommunications industry customers and isps combined accounted for  and of our total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
license revenues from investment banks accounted for  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no one customer accounted for more than of total revenue in fiscal cost of revenues cost of license revenues consists primarily of technology license fees paid to third party software vendors and the costs of software media  packaging and production 
cost of license revenues decreased as a percentage of license revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal  as a result of economies of scale 
cost of maintenance and service revenues consists primarily of personnel related costs incurred in providing maintenance  consulting and training to customers 
cost of maintenance and service revenues decreased as a percentage of maintenance and service revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal  principally due to economies of scale 
the increase from to was primarily due to increased personnel  facilities and travel costs associated with growth in the customer support and technical services organization 
we expect that maintenance and services costs will continue to increase in dollar amounts in future periods as we continue to hire additional customer support and technical services personnel and expand our maintenance  consulting and training activities 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by personnel engaged in sales  technical presales and marketing activities  as well as the costs of trade shows  public relations  marketing materials and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increases in both fiscal and fiscal reflected the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the building of our sales force 
sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
these percentage reductions were primarily due to the increased scale of operations 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales  technical services and marketing personnel  to increase marketing activities and to build our indirect sales channel 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and costs of computer systems and software development tools 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses in each year was primarily attributable to increased personnel  additional facilities and an increase in the computer systems and software development tools required by the additional personnel 
in addition to expanding our research and development facility in london  we established a research and development team focused on application development in our new york office in fiscal research and development expenses represented  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
these percentage reductions were primarily due to the increased scale of operations 
we expect that our research and development costs will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we continue to enhance and extend our core technologies and product lines 
to date  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for administration  finance  information systems and human resources  as well as professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal these increases in each year were primarily due to increased staffing  facilities costs and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations and  in fiscal  an additional increase was due to compensation expenses related to bonus shares issued 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal and were primarily attributable to the growth in total revenues and a reduction in professional fees related to the reorganization in fiscal we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we expand our administrative staff  add infrastructure and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business 
executive recruiting costs the executive recruiting costs include a charge related to the fair value of the warrant issued to the executive search firm to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  cash fees paid to the executive search firm and certain relocation costs 
other income expense other income in fiscal includes the interest earned from the proceeds raised from the public offerings  foreign exchange gains and losses  and the insurance proceeds related to the death of the former chairman and chief executive officer 
the interest earned in fiscal was partially offset by the imputed interest expense related to the fiscal issuance of a warrant to purchase million shares of series a preferred stock at a per share exercise price of issued in connection with the provision of a line of credit to the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the fiscal income tax provision reflects the utilization of prior years net operating loss carryforwards 
the fiscal income tax provision consisted primarily of state and local taxes 
discontinued operations in july  the company adopted a formal plan to discontinue its systems integration division based in england 
in september  the company sold the division for approximately  in cash  net of fees 
the disposition of the division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and prior consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the systems integration business 
revenue from discontinued operations was million and million  respectively  in fiscal and the income loss from discontinued operations of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  represents the operation s operating income  net of taxes 
the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of million in fiscal represents the gain on disposal of the operation including net income from operations of  from the measurement date to the disposal date 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was due primarily to net income of million  the net proceeds from the maturity and purchase of investments  and the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues 
these sources of cash and cash equivalents were partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock  capital expenditures  and the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses reflects the growth in the business while the increase in prepaid expense and other current assets includes a prepayment of technology license fees to a third party software vendor  rental deposits and prepaid value added taxes 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was due primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock  the increase in deferred revenues and the repayment of a related party loan 
these increases were partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities  treasury stock  capital expenditures  and the net loss of million 
the increase in deferred revenues includes additional maintenance plans related to the growing installed base of customers 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to a net loss of million offset partially by the proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as of september   the company s principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or obtain credit facilities 
the decision to sell additional equity or debt securities could be made at anytime and would likely result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
year compliance and euro conversion we have designed and tested our products to be year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that our current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to us 
in addition  certain components of our products process timestamp information from third party applications or local operating systems 
as a result  if such third party applications or local operating systems are not year compliant  our products that process such timestamp information may not be year compliant 
our evaluation of year related risks and corrective actions in connection with such third party applications  internally developed products and local operating systems is largely completed but will be ongoing 
in our standard license agreements  we provide certain warranties to licensees that our software routines and programs are year compliant 
if any of our licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages against us 
any such claims or litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if ultimately decided in our favor 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues  and we are aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain to what extent we may be affected by it 
based on work done to date and our best estimates  we have not incurred material costs and do not expect to incur future material costs in addressing the year issue in our systems and products 
our year internal readiness program primarily covers information technology based office facilities  data and voice communications  building management and security systems  taking inventory of hardware  software and embedded systems  assessing business and customer satisfaction risks associated with such systems  creating action plans to address known risks  executing and monitoring action plans  and contingency planning 
although we do not currently believe that we will experience material disruptions in our business associated with preparing our internal systems for the year  there can be no assurances that we will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems  which are composed of third party software  third party hardware that contains embedded software and our own software products 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include i corruption of data contained in our internal information systems  ii hardware failure and iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties eg  electricity  phone service  water transport  internet services  etc contingency plans to include  among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitution of systems  if necessary 
various european countries introduced a single currency known as the euro in january we have conducted a review of our internal information systems to identify the systems that could be affected by such year and euro conversion requirements 
further  to accommodate our recent growth  we will be required to continue to implement and improve a variety of operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
in particular  we will be required to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems  which currently require substantial management effort and will be required to implement a us based financial and accounting system 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and our business 
the following factors  in addition to the other information contained in this form k  should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and our prospects 
this form k including without limitation the following risk factors contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of regarding the company and our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward looking statements  but are not the exclusive means of identifying forward looking statements in this form k 
additionally  statements concerning future matters such as the development of new products  enhancements or technologies  possible changes in legislation and other statements regarding matters that are not historical are forward looking statements 
although forward looking statements in this form k reflect the good faith judgment of our management  such statements can only be based on facts and factors we currently know about 
consequently  forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of the this form k 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements in order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of the form k 
we have a limited operating history as a software company and are uncertain of future operating results although we began offering services for the network and systems integration market in  we first shipped our internally developed software product  netcool omnibus  for the fault and slm market in january accordingly  we have only a limited operating history as a developer and provider of slm software upon which an evaluation of our business and prospects can be based 
only recently has our software business been profitable 
our limited operating history and rapidly changing product development  installation  maintenance and market dynamics make the prediction of future results of operations difficult if not impossible 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  costs and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies  particularly companies in the competitive software industry 
although we have achieved recent revenue growth  there can be no assurance that we can generate substantial additional revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis  or that any revenue growth that is achieved can be sustained 
in addition  we have increased  and plan to increase further  our operating expenses in order to hire experienced senior managers  develop new distribution channels  increase our sales and marketing efforts  implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  broaden technical services and customer support capabilities  fund higher levels of research and development and expand administrative resources in anticipation of future growth 
to the extent that increases in such expenses are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and markets and our limited operating history in historic and newly evolving markets  we believe that period to period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced variability of quarterly operating results  seasonality we continue to realize a significant portion of license revenues in the last month of a quarter  frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are difficult to forecast because it is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  our sales cycles  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  vary substantially from customer to customer 
in addition  our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future orders and sales  which  given our limited operating history  are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities  and sales and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see we have a lengthy sales cycle 
the number and timing of large individual sales has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
there can be no assurance that the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales would not have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
in addition  our business has experienced and may continue to experience significant seasonality 
historically  a disproportionate amount of our annual revenues have been generated by sales of our products during our fourth fiscal quarter 
there can be no assurance that this trend will or will not continue 
significant components of our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly at times in the past  and will likely fluctuate significantly at some times in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include changes in the demand for our software products and services  the size and timing of specific sales  the timing of new hires  the level of product and price competition that we encounter  changes in the mix of  and lack of demand from  distribution channels through which products are sold  the length of sales cycles  spending patterns and budgetary resources of our customers on network management software solutions  the success of our new customer generation activities  introductions or enhancements of products  or delays in the introductions or enhancements of our products and those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products  our ability to anticipate and effectively adapt to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies  the mix of products and services sold  changes in our sales incentives  changes in the renewal rate of support agreements  the mix of international and domestic revenue  product life cycles  software defects and other product quality problems  our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  changes in the mix of sales to new and existing customers  the extent of industry consolidation  expansion of our international operations  and general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
based on all of the foregoing  we believe that future revenue  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful or indicative of future performance 
furthermore  we believe it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or generally  the market price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we need to manage growth  we need to improve our infrastructure we have recently experienced a period of rapid revenue and customer growth and a substantial expansion in the number of our personnel and in the scope and the geographic area of our operations 
we have grown from employees on september  to employees on september  and currently plan to continue to recruit more staff 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and has placed and continues to place a significant strain upon our management  operating and financial systems and resources 
moreover  members of our management team  including  without limitation  the chairman and chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer  senior vice president  sales and business operations  senior vice president  general counsel and secretary and senior vice president  human resources have been in their current positions with the company for a limited period of time 
to accommodate recent growth  to compete effectively and manage future growth  if any  we will be required to continue to implement and improve a variety of operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
in particular  we will be required to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems  which currently require substantial management effort  and to successfully manage an increasing number of relationships with customers  suppliers and employees 
these demands will require the addition of new management personnel  and we are currently in the process of recruiting individuals to fill important management positions such as the vice president  marketing 
further  we are will need to continue to develop a us based financial and accounting system 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the recruitment and retention of these key personnel  the implementation and improvement of operational  financial and management systems and the ability of our current and future executive officers to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute on a timely and cost effective basis all that is necessary to successfully manage any growth  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we need to expand and improve the productivity of our sales force  technical services and customer support organization to increase market penetration  we continue to hire additional sales personnel 
based on our experience  such personnel are in high demand  difficult to recruit and retain and it takes at least nine months  if not longer  for a salesperson to become fully productive 
although we increased the size of our sales organization during fiscal  we experienced difficulty in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified sales people during the period 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting additional sales personnel or increasing the productivity of our sales personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of the recent expansion of the installed base of netcool omnibus and the release of our netcool reporter  netcool internet service monitors  netcool firewall  netcool fusion  netcool ntsm  and netcool impact  the demands on our technical services and customer support resources have grown rapidly 
see product defects would impair our business 
we believe that a high level of technical services  training and customer support is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we will be required to significantly expand our technical services and customer support organizations and similar third party capabilities if we are to achieve significant additional revenue growth 
competition for additional qualified technical personnel to perform the required functions is intense 
there can be no assurance that our technical services and customer support resources will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business  and any failure to expand our technical services and customer support organizations commensurate with any expansion of the installed base of the above products would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we need to expand our distribution channels  we depend on third party relationships a key element of our business strategy is to develop relationships with leading network equipment and telecommunications providers and to expand the third party channel of distribution 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these relationships and channels of distribution  which could adversely affect our ability to generate profits 
third party distributors accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract additional distributors that will be able to market our products effectively 
many of our agreements with third party distributors are nonexclusive  and many of the companies with which we have agreements also have similar agreements with our competitors or potential competitors 
our third party distributors have significantly greater sales and marketing resources than we do  and there can be no assurance that their sales and marketing efforts will not conflict with our direct sales efforts 
in addition  although sales through third party distributors result in reduced sales and marketing expense with respect to such sales  we sell our products to third party distributors at reduced prices  resulting in lower gross margins on such third party sales 
we believe that our success in penetrating markets for our fault and slm applications depends substantially on our ability to maintain our current distribution relationships  in particular  those with cisco systems cisco  lucent technologies lucent unishpere siemens and others  to cultivate additional distribution relationships and to cultivate alternative distribution relationships if distribution channels change 
there can be no assurance that network equipment and telecommunications providers and distributors will not discontinue their relationships with us  compete directly with us or form additional competing arrangements with our competitors or that we will be able to expand our distribution relationships beyond what currently exists 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in an emerging market  we rely on telecommunication carriers and other service providers  we are uncertain of the demand for fault and slm products the market for our products is in an early stage of development and is very dynamic 
although the rapid expansion and increasing complexity of computer networks in recent years and the resulting emergence of slas has increased the demand for fault and slm software products  the awareness of and the need for such products is a recent development 
because the market for these products is only beginning to develop  it is difficult to assess the size of this market  the appropriate features and prices for products to address this market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
failure of the slm market to grow at anticipated rates or our failure to properly assess and address the demands from such market would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
telecommunications carriers  including isps  that deliver advanced communications services to their customers have accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  these providers are the central focus of our sales strategy 
there can be no assurance that telecommunications carriers and other service providers will be able to market their communications services successfully  that slm will gain widespread market acceptance or that telecommunications carriers and other service providers will use our products in the deployment of their services 
delays in the introduction of advanced services  such as network management outsourcing  failure of such services to gain widespread market acceptance or the decision of telecommunications carriers and other service providers not to use our products in the deployment of these services would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance we will be able to penetrate these markets further 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are extremely competitive our products are designed for use in the evolving fault and slm and enterprise network management markets 
competition in these markets is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  new and evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our current and prospective competitors offer a variety of solutions to address the fault and slm and enterprise network management markets and generally fall within the following five categories i customer s internal design and development organizations that produce slm and network management applications for their particular needs  in some cases using multiple instances of products from hardware and software vendors such as sun microsystems  inc sun  hewlett packard company hp and cabletron systems  inc cabletron  ii vendors of network and systems management frameworks including computer associates international  inc ca and international business machines corporation ibm  iii vendors of network and systems management applications including hp  bmc software  inc  sun and ibm  iv providers of specific market applications  and v systems integrators serving the telecommunications industry which primarily provide programming services to develop customer specific applications including tcsi corporation formerly teknekron communications systems  inc and objective systems integrators  inc

as we enter new markets  we have seen that such markets have additional  market specific competitors 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry in the software market  we have become aware of new and potential entrants in portions of our market space and we expect additional competition from these and other established and emerging companies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions and may result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
many of our existing and potential customers and distributors continuously evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or purchase them from outside vendors 
sometimes these customers internally design and develop their own software solutions for their particular needs and therefore may be reluctant to purchase products offered by independent vendors such as ours 
as a result  we must continuously educate existing and prospective customers as to the advantages of our products versus internally developed network operations support and management applications 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have significantly greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products or to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
existing competitors could also increase their market share by bundling products having management functionality offered by our products with their current applications 
moreover  our current and potential competitors may increase their share of the fault and slm market by strategic alliances and or the acquisition of competing companies 
in addition  network operating system vendors could introduce new or upgrade and extend existing operating systems or environments that include management functionality offered by our products  which could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
product defects would impair our business software products as internally complex as those identified in this report frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
despite our extensive product testing  we have in the past released versions of netcool omnibus with defects and have discovered software errors in certain of our products after their introduction 
for example  version of netcool omnibus  released in  had a number of material defects 
version of netcool reporter  released in  had features and performance characteristics that limited market acceptance 
a significant portion of our technical personnel resources were required to address these defects 
we could continue to experience delays in or failure of market acceptance of products  or damage to our reputation or relationships with our customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
see we need to expand and improve the productivity of sales force  technical services and customer support organization 
additionally  there can be no assurance that  despite our testing and that by current and potential customers  defects and errors will not be found in new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
see year and euro conversion issues could impair our business 
since our products are used by our customers to monitor and address network problems and avoid failures of the network to support critical business functions  any design defects  software errors  misuse of our products  incorrect data from network elements or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
such customers could seek damages from us for any such losses  which  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
although we maintain product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately cover  if at all  any such claims 
further  although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims and the liability and costs associated therewith 
accordingly  any such claim could have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have a lengthy sales cycle our software is generally used for division or enterprise wide  business critical purposes and involves significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
licensing of our software products often require an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to license such software generally involve the evaluation of the software by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
as a result of these and other factors  the sales cycle for our products are long  typically about three to nine months 
as a result of the length of the sales cycle for our software products  our ability to forecast the timing and amount of specific sales is limited  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large license transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
see we have experienced variability of quarterly operating results  seasonality 
we depend on key personnel our success is substantially dependent upon a limited number of key management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we do not generally have employment contracts with key personnel 
in addition  our success will be dependent upon our continuing ability to attract  train and retain additional highly qualified management  sales  product development  technical services and customer support personnel 
we have at times and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
because we face intense competition in our recruiting activities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and or retain qualified personnel 
failure to attract and retain the necessary qualified personnel on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition

we must successfully integrate acquisitions on november   we entered into an agreement to acquire calvin alexander networking  inc  a developer of network autodiscovery technology 
acquisitions of companies  products or technologies entail numerous risks  including an inability to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired companies  substantial transaction costs  and substantial additional costs charged to operations as a result of the failure to consummate acquisitions 
some of the products we acquire may require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at levels we anticipate 
moreover  our future acquisitions  if any  may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs and creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization expense 
we cannot guarantee that our efforts to consummate or integrate acquisitions will be successful 
if our efforts are not successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
we rely on a specific product all of our revenues have been derived from licenses for our netcool family of products and related maintenance  training and consulting services 
we currently expect that netcool omnibus related revenues will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our revenues beyond fiscal and for the foreseeable future thereafter 
although we ve introduced netcool reporter  netcool internet service monitors  netcool firewall  netcool fusion  netcool ntsm  and netcool impact  our future operating results  particularly in the near term  are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of netcool omnibus  improvements to netcool omnibus and new and enhanced netcool omnibus applications 
there can be no assurance that netcool omnibus will continue to achieve market acceptance or that we will be successful in developing  introducing or marketing improvements to netcool omnibus or new or enhanced products 
the life cycles of netcool omnibus  including the netcool omnibus applications  are difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent emergence of many of our markets  the effect of future product enhancements and competition 
a decline in the demand for netcool omnibus as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on certain customers to date  a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period has been attributable to a limited number of customers 
although no one customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal  entities affiliated with mci worldcom accounted for and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
as a result of this concentration of sales  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders from significant customers to materialize or by deferrals or cancellations of orders by significant customers 
in addition  there can be no assurance that revenues from customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue  or if continued  will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
the terms of our agreements with our customers typically contain a one time license fee and a prepayment of one year of maintenance fees 
the maintenance agreement is renewable annually at the option of the customer and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any of our current customers will generate significant revenues in future periods 
for example  pre existing customers may be part of  or become part of  large organizations that standardize using a competitive product 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have risks associated with international licensing and operations license  maintenance and service revenues outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect that international license  maintenance and consulting revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries in which we license our products or conducts operations historically have had  and in the future could continue to have  a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition by resulting in pricing levels that are not competitive or expense levels that adversely impact profitability 
in such event  gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results 
we intend to enter into additional international markets and to continue to expand our operations outside of the united states by expanding our direct sales force and pursuing additional strategic relationships 
such expansion will require significant management attention and expenditure of significant financial resources and could adversely affect our ability to generate profits 
to the extent that we are unable to establish additional foreign operations in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in international sales will be limited  and our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we maintain a significant portion of our operations  including the bulk of our software development operations  in the united kingdom 
our international operations and revenues involve a number of inherent risks  including longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  an even lengthier sales cycle than with domestic customers  the impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecommunications service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and tariffs and other trade barriers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain or increase revenues derived from international licensing and service or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international license  service and other revenue  and  consequently  on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies and do not currently engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
in addition  sales in europe and certain other parts of the world typically are adversely affected in the quarter ending september  as many customers reduce their business activities during the summer months 
if our international sales become a greater component of total revenue  these seasonal factors may have a more pronounced effect on our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we need to manage new products  transitions and rapid technological change  we depend on third party software platforms the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory environments  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the introduction or announcement of products by the company or our competitors embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
historically  we have used our close working relationship with large customers to define our product development direction 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product features that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new products and features  or that our new products or product features will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
in particular  the widespread adoption of the tmn architecture for managing telecommunications networks would force us to adapt our products to such standard  and there can be no assurance that this could be done on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
in addition  to the extent that any product upgrade or enhancement requires extensive installation and configuration  current customers may postpone or forgo the purchase of new versions of our products 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce enhancements of existing products or new products in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by us or one or more of our competitors will not cause customers to defer licensing of our existing products 
any such deferment of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms employed by our customers in their networks 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by systems vendors  particularly sun  ibm  hp  cabletron and cisco and by vendors of relational database software  particularly oracle corporation oracle and sybase  inc sybase  could materially adversely impact our business  operating results or financial condition 
for example  we are modifying certain of our products to operate with the linux operating system 
the failure of our products to operate effectively across the various existing and evolving versions of hardware and software platforms and database environments employed by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we rely upon proprietary technology  we risk third party claims of infringement our success and ability to compete is dependent in significant part upon our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technology will prevent misappropriation of such technology  and such protections may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that we will not receive future communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have risks associated with third party licenses we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
although we believe that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by us until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
year and euro conversion issues could impair our business we have designed and tested our products to be year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that our current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to us 
in addition  certain components of our products process timestamp information from third party applications or local operating systems 
as a result  if such third party applications or local operating systems are not year compliant  our products that process such timestamp information may not be year compliant 
our evaluation of year related risks and corrective actions in connection with such third party applications  internally developed products and local operating systems is largely completed but will be ongoing 
in our standard license agreements  we provide certain warranties to licensees that our software routines and programs are year compliant 
if any of our licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages against us 
any such claims or litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources even if ultimately decided in our favor 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues  and we are aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain to what extent we may be affected by it 
based on work done to date and our best estimates  we have not incurred material costs and do not expect to incur future material costs in addressing the year issue in our systems and products 
our year internal readiness program primarily covers information technology based office facilities  data and voice communications  building management and security systems  taking inventory of hardware  software and embedded systems  assessing business and customer satisfaction risks associated with such systems  creating action plans to address known risks  executing and monitoring action plans  and contingency planning 
although we do not currently believe that we will experience material disruptions in our business associated with preparing our internal systems for the year  there can be no assurances that we will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems  which are composed of third party software  third party hardware that contains embedded software and our own software products 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include i corruption of data contained in our internal information systems  ii hardware failure and iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and other third parties eg  electricity  phone service  water transport  internet services  etc contingency plans to include  among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitution of systems  if necessary 
various european countries introduced a single currency known as the euro in january we have conducted a review of our internal information systems to identify the systems that could be affected by such year and euro conversion requirements 
further  to accommodate our recent growth  we will be required to continue to implement and improve a variety of operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
in particular  we will be required to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems  which currently require substantial management effort and will be required to implement a us based financial and accounting system 
our stock price is volatile the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to copyrights or proprietary rights  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
general economic and market conditions may impair our business segments of the software industry have experienced significant economic downturns characterized by decreased product demand  price erosion  work slowdowns and layoffs 
our operations may in the future experience substantial fluctuations from period to period as a consequence of general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers and other factors affecting capital spending 
although we have a diverse client base  we target certain vertical markets 
therefore  any economic downturns in general or in the targeted vertical segments in particular would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
anti takeover effects of certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
our authorized but unissued capital stock includes million shares of preferred stock 
the board of directors is authorized to provide for the issuance of such preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the designations  preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional or other rights and restrictions thereof 
accordingly  we may in the future issue a series of preferred stock  without further stockholder approval  that will have preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company 
further  section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware as amended from time to time  the dgcl  which is applicable to us  prohibits certain business combinations with certain stockholders for a period of three years after they acquire or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation 
in addition  the restated certificate of incorporation provides that the board of directors is divided into two classes of directors with each class serving a staggered two year term 
the classification of the board of directors has the effect of generally requiring at least two annual stockholder meetings  instead of one  to replace a majority of the board members 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect holders of the common stock or discourage or make difficult any attempt to obtain control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivatives and financial instruments foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenues and operating expenses in the uk however  as of september   no hedging contracts were outstanding 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in the uk instead  we believe that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenues will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with less than three months to maturity are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three months or less are considered cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments  investments with maturities in excess of twelve months are considered to be long term investments 
the weighted average pre tax interest rate on the investment portfolio is approximately 
we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio
