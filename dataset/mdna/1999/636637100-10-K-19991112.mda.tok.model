impact of year issue introduction the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software has historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date field 
state of readiness to date  we have completed the year conversion with respect to all of our computer systems and applications 
we have completed remediation and testing of our computer systems and applications 
while we have completed all required system remediation and testing for the year  we will continue our testing efforts and make appropriate remediations as necessary through january  because of the substantial progress made by us towards our year conversion  we do not anticipate that any additional significant changes will be required or that the year issue will pose significant operational problems for us 
however  if the company  its customers and vendors are unable to make necessary changes in a timely fashion and if unanticipated problems arise  the year issue may take longer for us to address and may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations
