item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table represents the company s consolidated statement of income data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the three most recent fiscal years net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income 


interest expense 
income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales of billion in were million or higher than the billion reported in the increase was attributable to higher demand for pcs  improved productivity in relationship marketing and the full year effect of the inclusion of sales from midwest micro corp  acquired at the end of the third quarter of the company also began to benefit from orders received through its various internet web sites 
sales attributable to the company s north american operations increased to billion in from million in european sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
movements in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial effect on the european sales comparison 
gross profit  which consists of net sales less product  shipping and certain distribution center costs  increased by million or to million in from million in gross profit margin decreased to in from in gross profit margin on pcs improved in the current year 
with sales of pcs representing an increasing proportion of the company s sales and with margins that are lower than on other products  they have the effect of decreasing the overall gross profit margin 
the decrease in the gross profit margin was also due to increased sales of brand name computer related products  which typically have lower gross profit margins  and the relatively lower sales contribution of higher margin industrial products 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in this improvement resulted from a focus on controlling expenses and improved productivity from the company s relationship marketing staff and offset a large portion of the gross profit margin decline 
income from operations increased by million or to million in from million in income from operations decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in interest income decreased million to million in from million in as a result of lower interest rates 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the effective tax rate increased to in from in as a result of a higher effective state income tax rate and a change in the relative income earned in foreign countries 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased million  or  to million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased by million or to billion in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to i an increase in revenue from the company s major account sales program  ii the inclusion of sales from midwest micro since its acquisition at the end of september  iii an increase in the sales of brand name and private label pcs and notebook computers and iv an increased average order value resulting from increased offerings and sales of brand name products 
sales attributable to the company s north american operations increased to million in from million in european sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
in local currencies without foreign exchange rate effects  european sales increased 
gross profit  which consists of net sales less product  shipping and certain distribution center costs  increased by million or to million in from million in gross profit margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to i the company s strategic decision to increase the proportion of net sales attributable to brand name products  particularly pcs  notebook computers  computer related products and hardware which typically have lower gross profit margin percentages than many of the company s other products  ii the increase in the proportion of sales from the company s major account sales group which generally sells to larger customers at discounted prices  and iii increased shipping and other costs associated with the united parcel service labor action in august a significant portion of this decline in gross profit margin has been offset by the continued decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
while selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million in from million in  as a percentage of net sales they decreased to in from in the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to reduced catalog costs in north america as a result of the increased efficiencies from larger average order sizes  vendor supported advertising  continued expense control and the leveraging of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger sales base 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses in was a one time charge of million incurred during the third quarter relating to the impairment of certain long lived assets  principally goodwill 
as a result of the above  income from operations decreased by million or to million in from million in income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to from in interest income increased

seasonality the operations of the company are somewhat seasonal 
in particular  net sales have historically been modestly weaker during the second and third quarter as a result of lower business activity during the summer months 
the following table sets forth net sales  gross profit and income from operations for each of the quarters since january  amounts in millions 
march june september december net sales gross profit income from operations march june september december net sales gross profit income from operations includes approximately million of net sales from midwest micro acquired on september  liquidity and capital resources the company continues to maintain a strong financial position 
primary capital needs are to finance working capital for sales growth  acquisitions and investments in property  equipment and information technology 
the company s primary source of financing has been cash from operations  allowing it to remain virtually debt free 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  existing cash and short term investments and available lines of credit will be adequate to support its current and anticipated activities 
cash flow from operating activities was million in  million in and million in cash flow is provided primarily by net income and depreciation 
the increase in inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses in resulted from expansion activities in the company s pc assembly operation and increased sales activity 
the increase in cash flow from to was due to improved asset management  primarily related to accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash of million was used in in investing activities for business acquisitions and additions to property  plant and equipment 
these included capacity expansion at the company s pc assembly factory  completion of the new compton  california facility and improvements to information technology systems 
net cash used in investing activities in was primarily for the acquisition of midwest micro and the acquisition of furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements needed to accommodate increased staff levels at the new compton  california facility 
short term investments were decreased by million as partial funding for these activities resulting in net cash used of million for investing activities for the year 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  employed for the acquisition of computer equipment and additional equipment at the naperville  illinois facility to accommodate increased staff levels 
surplus cash balances of million were invested 
cash was used in financing activities in million and in million and provided million in in  the company used million of cash to purchase shares of its common stock 
the use of funds in was for the repayment of long term debt 
in  the net proceeds from issuance of shares of common stock was partially used to repay long term bank debt and settle long term capital leases 
the company maintains secured and unsecured lines of credit with various financial institutions under which the maximum aggregate amount available is approximately million 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit 
borrowings under the lines bear interest based on either the prime rate or libor 
the maximum borrowings under the facilities are reduced where applicable by the value of any outstanding letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
the company does not anticipate any difficulty in renewing or replacing any if its lines of credit as they expire 
the company is party to certain litigation  as disclosed in commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the outcome of which the company believes will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements 
anticipated capital expenditures in are expected to approximate million  which the company plans to fund out of cash from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents 
these capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of the company s pc assembly operation  construction of a new distribution center and the acquisition of information technology systems and other fixed assets 
year compliance the company is in the process of analyzing and addressing what is known as the year or yk issue 
based on current information  the company believes that it will be year compliant in a timely manner and the cost of achieving such compliance will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
as noted in the following discussion  however  there are multiple variables in determining whether full yk compliance can be achieved  a number of which are dependent on efforts of third parties 
background 
this issue has arisen because many existing computer programs use only two digits instead of four eg  instead of to identify a year in the data field 
this is a holdover from the days when businesses first started using computers and electronic memory was limited and storage was expensive 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
accordingly  some computers can not determine if the reference to the year means or the failure of such applications or systems to properly recognize the dates beginning in the year could result in miscalculations or even systems failures 
the company could be affected by this problem both as a user of computers and as a direct marketer and retail vendor of pcs and computer related products including private label pcs assembled by its midwest micro subsidiary 
in the company established a year team to assess the company s yk compliance situation 
this team consists of the company s chief financial officer  chief information officer  controller  general counsel and a representative from the company s management information system mis department 
internal systems the company s yk team established a plan to have all of the company s computer and computer dependent systems tested and  if necessary  modified or replaced to ensure yk compliance 
each of the company s computers and computer dependent systems has been analyzed to assess what would be the impact on the company if the system becomes materially impaired due to yk non compliance 
each system has been placed in one of three categories based on the level of risk to the company level i catastrophic risk  level ii critical risk and level iii sustainable risk 
the company is now in the process of modifying those systems identified during the assessment as level i risks and doing live tests of the level i and level ii systems to ascertain anticipated yk compliance 
based on its analysis to date  the company believes that all of its internal computer systems hardware  system software and applications software and computer dependent systems  including technology embedded in the company s machinery and other equipment to the extent that it is date sensitive  are currently yk compliant or will  through the replacement or modification of existing hardware and software  be made yk complaint in a timely manner 
a target date of july  has been fixed for such compliance 
the company believes at this time that it should be able to meet such target date 
the company has not retained any outside service provider to conduct independent verification of the company s compliance status and does not at this time intend to hire any such service provider but is utilizing a third party software program to test  assess and repair non mainframe hardware 
as a direct marketer of products  the company is particularly dependent on the ability of telecommunications  shipping and credit card companies to provide services 
the company has contacted its key vendors and service providers to ascertain their yk compliance to the extent that their noncompliance could affect the company s internal systems or other aspects of the company s business 
the company expects to have completed this process by june the company at this time cannot make any prediction as to the degree of compliance by such vendors and service providers or the consequence to the company of any noncompliance 
any noncompliance by such service providers could have a material adverse impact on the company 
similar issues will be faced with the company s banks and payroll services  as well as other vendors 
any serious yk problems which significant vendors and service providers encounter could materially adversely impact the company 
since the company s customer base is diverse and no one customer accounts for a significant portion of the company s business  the company does not at this time believe that it is necessary to query customers on their yk compliance status 
while the company believes that the efforts which it has taken and plans to take should be sufficient to identify and correct any yk problems before december   there can be no assurance that the company will be fully yk complaint in a timely manner 
products sold the company began assembling its own private label pc hardware systems following the acquisition of its midwest micro subsidiary on september  prior to this time the company only sold private label pc systems assembled by third party contract manufacturers 
the company believes that all of the private label pc hardware systems it sells  including those it assembles itself  are yk complaint 
all pc hardware systems assembled by the company on or after january  have been certified to be yk compliant by the national software testing lab nstl  an independent testing lab 
the company is in the process of questioning its vendors as to the yk compliance status of the brand name ie third party manufactured hardware and software products it sells 
accordingly  the company cannot be certain at this time  and does not warrant to its customers  that the brand name computer hardware and software it currently sells is yk compliant 
this includes the brand name software that is pre loaded onto the private label pcs the company sells 
while the company believes that the liability for any yk failure of any computer hardware or software the company sells rests with the manufacturer of such products or components  and it understands that most of the major manufacturers have fixes available for certain older products which have yk problems  it is possible that purchasers from the company may make claims against the company for alleged yk problems with respect to products sold by the company and there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in having any such liability be borne by its vendors 
financial ramifications the company estimates that the costs of achieving yk compliance  including costs of personnel devoting significant effort on yk matters  will be approximately  of which approximately  has been incurred through december  the costs associated with any new computers or computer programs which are year compliant have been and will be capitalized and amortized over the computer s and or software s expected useful life 
any system modification or maintenance costs necessary to make the company s existing computer programs yk compliant have been and will be expensed as incurred 
based on the company s current status of internal yk compliance review and other preliminary information  the company does not anticipate that expenses yet to be incurred to achieve year compliance will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition or that its business will be adversely affected by the yk issue in any material respect 
nevertheless  achieving yk compliance is dependent on multiple factors  many of which are not within the company s sole control 
should one or more of the internal systems of the company or the company s key vendors exhibit significant yk problems or if any of the products which the company sells which are still under warranty are yk deficient  the company s business and its results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company may see an increase in warranty claims related to the yk issue 
the company s standard limited warranty period for the pc systems it assembles ranges from one to five years from the date of first purchase  depending upon the system purchased and the particular component part warranted 
the company does not make any separate warranty on brand name products it sells  instead passing on the manufacturer s warranty 
the company can not at this time assess the level of yk related warranty claims it may receive regarding its products 
a significant level of warranty claims relating to the yk issue could have a materially adverse impact on the company s future results 
risks until it has completed its yk assessment  and attempted to fix any problems which such assessment may disclose  the company can not be in a position to determine what would be its most reasonably likely worst case yk scenario or any plan for handling such scenario 
the company has not devised any back up plans should it suffer any internal yk problems or should any of its vendors yk problems affect the company 
after completion of its yk assessment  including a review of the responses received from such vendors  the company will assess the need for any contingency plans 
the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption of  or inability to perform in a timely fashion  a necessary business activity or operation 
such failures could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
because of the general uncertainty which companies generally face regarding the year issue  in part due to actions of third parties which could affect a company s compliance  it is not possible to determine at this time whether any actual failures will have a material adverse impact on the company 
the foregoing discussion contains forward looking statements which should be read in conjunction with the discussion entitled forward looking statements set forth below 
implications to the company from the adoption of a european common currency the company has extensive operations in certain european countries  including france  germany  italy  the netherlands  spain  sweden  england and scotland 
it also sells to additional countries in europe 
for the fiscal year  approximately of the company s net sales were in europe 
with the exception of sweden and the united kingdom  all of the countries in which the company has operations have confirmed their participation in a new country european common currency  the euro 
the adoption of such common currency will be phased in over a three year period starting in january during such phase in period  both the euro and the historical currency of a country will be valid  although new euro denominated currency will not be issued until each member country will decide when its legacy currency will cease to be legal tender  which will occur during the period january through june  until the introduction of euro denominated currency  the paying party will have the option to decide whether to pay in the legacy currency or in euros converted to the legacy currency 
among other possible economic implications  it is expected that the adoption of a common currency will generally lead to greater price transparency and thereby increased competition within the common currency zone 
for instance  with a single currency applicable to the entire region  consumers may be able to more easily discern differences in price for the company s products between different countries and modify their buying practices accordingly 
this is less likely to be a factor for the company than for many other companies since the company currently only advertises the euro price on its internet sites  not in its catalogs 
also  purchasers of low cost individual products are less likely to shop for a lower euro price outside of their geographic location 
the company will still use national catalogs  in the appropriate language  after the introduction of the euro 
whether any such price differentials will lead to significant changes in purchasing practices by the company s customers depends on other factors as well  such as convenience  language related matters and other factors which may determine where a consumer will purchase products 
the company is not able at this time to gauge whether the likelihood of increased competition arising from the introduction of the euro would have any significant long term adverse impact on the pricing for the company s products 
the adoption of a common currency will not require a significant modification to the company s accounting systems 
the company does not believe that the adoption of a common currency will give any parties to material contracts with the company the right to terminate or modify such contracts on the grounds of frustration  impossibility or impracticability 
other risks associated with such currency conversion include possible currency exchange and tax risks  neither of which the company believes will have a significant effect 
the company does not at this time anticipate that the adoption of the euro and any resulting changes in european economic and market conditions will have any material adverse impact on the company or its european business 
the company has not adopted  nor is it at this time contemplating the adoption of  any contingency plans regarding this issue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
global attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing certain derivative financial instruments 
the value of the us dollar affects the company s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect global s sales as expressed in us dollars  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings 
the company may engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of certain currency fluctuations 
using primarily forward exchange and foreign currency option contracts  global  from time to time  hedges certain of its assets that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  may impact the statement of consolidated income 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets  availability of hedging instruments and the credit worthiness of the parties which have entered into such contracts with the company 
all currency contracts that are entered into by global are for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculative or trading purposes 
in spite of global s hedging efforts to reduce the effect of changes in exchange rates against the us dollar  the company s sales or costs could still be adversely affected by changes in those exchange rates 
as of december  the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts
