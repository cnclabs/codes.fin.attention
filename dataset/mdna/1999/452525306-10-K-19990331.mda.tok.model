management believes that its current cash and investments balance will be sufficient to meet its operating and capital requirements in year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and devices with imbedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in the event that the company does not effectively address the year issue  these functions could be performed manually on a short term basis 
the company has determined that the risks associated with exposure to third parties that suffer problems with year issues are not material because of the company s ability to source needed supplies and services from multiple sources 
in conjunction with a consultant  the company has reviewed the ability of its computer equipment and software to function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
for this purpose  the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as information technology it systems  including accounting  data processing  and telephone pbx  and other miscellaneous systems  as well as systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems  fax machines  processing equipment  or other miscellaneous systems 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company believes that certain of the computer equipment and software it currently uses principally its financial accounting system and several personal computers will require replacement or modification 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company attempts to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
the software and hardware required to address the year issue was identified during the fourth quarter of the company estimates that the total costs of efforts required to address the year issue will not exceed  these costs  a portion of which may be capitalized  are expected to be incurred while the project is completed in the first quarter of forward looking statements the statements contained in this report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve various important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors including  but not limited to  the risk factors discussed below 
the company is heavily dependent on the successful development of new products for its future growth 
these new products have the potential to increase the company s profitability 
by reducing research and development expenses  the company presently has the ability to report increasing net operating profits 
it is the company s objective to fund all selling  general and administrative expenses as well as all research and development expenditures that are not funded by an outside source with the gross margin earned from current product sales and from available cash 
continuation of the company s profitability will  in large part  be determined by the ongoing successful marketing of first defense and the kamar heatmount detector 
growth in the company s profitability will  in large part  be determined by the success of the company s efforts to develop new animal health products

if clinical trials are successful  sales of diffgam tm would not be anticipated to begin until approximately the year  due to the complex regulatory process required to obtain approval of this product 
if the product is successfully developed  the company intends to enter into a marketing alliance with a corporate partner to fund clinical development beyond the phase ii trial that the company expects to complete by the end of and to distribute the product if fda approval is obtained 
the company estimates that any such partner could achieve potential sales of diffgam of approximately  to  the company anticipates being able to financially benefit from a manufacturing and supply agreement  or other royalty arrangements with a potential marketing partner 
the ultimate profitability of this product cannot be accurately predicted at this time 
risk factors the development of these new products is subject to financial  efficacy  regulatory and market risks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to finance the development of these new product opportunities nor that  if financed  the new products will be found to be efficacious and gain the appropriate regulatory approval 
furthermore  if regulatory approval is obtained  there can be no assurance that the market estimates will prove to be accurate or that market acceptance at a profitable price level can be achieved or that the products can be profitably manufactured 
effects of inflation and interest rates the company believes that neither inflation nor interest rates have had a significant effect on revenues and expenses
