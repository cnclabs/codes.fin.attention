these funds were generated from operating activities 
the company s long term capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  the time required to obtain regulatory approvals  the resources that the company devotes to the development of self funded products  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  the cost of acquisition and or new revenue opportunities  the ability of the company to obtain additional licensing arrangements and to manufacture products under those arrangements  the demand for its products if and when approved and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
the company believes that its existing working capital and funds anticipated to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash needs for continuation of its present operations during see safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of year impact of the year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  computer programs  computers and embedded microprocessors controlling equipment with date sensitive systems may recognize year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat year may result in computer system failures or miscalculations of critical financial and operational information as well as failures of equipment controlling date sensitive microprocessors 
in addition  there are two other related issues  which could also lead to miscalculations or failures i some older systems programming assigns special meaning to certain dates  such as and ii the year is a leap year 
state of readiness the company started to formulate a plan to address the year issue in to date  the company s primary focus has been on its own internal information technology systems  along with date sensitive subsystems of its products 
the company has developed a year plan to address all of its year issues 
the year plan being developed will involve generally the following phrases awareness  assessment  renovation  testing and implementation 
the company has completed an assessment of approximately of its internal information technology systems 
the company has already completed the renovation of approximately of its information technology systems  including modifying and upgrading software and developing and purchasing new software  and continues to renovate the portions of such systems for which assessment is complete 
the company s goal is to complete testing and implementation phases by june  the company has recently begun to assess the potential for year problems with the information systems of its customers and vendors 
the company is preparing questionnaires that it expects to send to its customers  vendors and other third parties with which the company has a material relationship by march  the company expects to complete the assessment with respect to such parties by june   subject to their ability to provide requested information 
the company does not have sufficient information to provide an estimated timetable for completion of renovation and testing that such parties with which the company has a material relationship may undertake 
the company is unable to estimate the costs that it may incur to remedy the year issues relating to such parties 
all of the mission critical date sensitive systems used in the company s products have been evaluated for their compliance with year issues 
the findings of this evaluation are that  with an upgrade to the computer system of the equipment  along with an operating system upgrade  the system will be fully compliant with the year the existing customer base of the company has been notified of this  and where upgrades have been performed  compliance certificates have been issued 
customers have also been advised that if an upgrade is not purchased  a compliance certificate cannot be issued 
any other date related information contained in systems and software of the equipment that would not have any impact on the operation and safety of the company s products will be addressed with vendors to the company throughout the company has done an assessment of the potential for year problems with the embedded microprocessors in its other equipment and facilities  including telecommunications systems  utilities  security systems and hvacs and expects no significant effect on the non critical functions of the company  provided major suppliers of mass consumption items  such as electricity  telephone and data transmission  gasoline  water  natural gas and waste disposal  meet their projections of year compliance 
the company has already installed a new telephone system in to comply with year costs to address year issues the company estimates on a preliminary basis that the cost of assessment  renovation  testing and implementation of its internal systems will not be material to the overall operations of the company 
the major components of these costs are consultants  programming  new software and hardware  software upgrades and travel expenses 
the company expects that such costs will be funded through operating cash flows 
this estimate  based on currently available information  will be updated as the company continues its assessment and proceeds with renovation  testing and implementation and may be adjusted upon receipt of more information from the company s vendors  customers and other third parties and upon the design and implementation of the company s contingency plan 
in addition  the availability and cost of consultants and other personnel trained in this area and unanticipated acquisitions might materially affect the estimated costs 
risks to the company the company s year issue involves significant risks 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in implementing the year plan it is developing 
the following describes the company s most reasonably likely worse case scenario  given current uncertainties 
if the company s renovated or replaced internal information technology systems fail the testing phase  or any software application or embedded microprocessors central to the company s operations are overlooked in the assessment or implementing phases  significant problems including delays may be incurred in billing the company s major customers for services performed 
if its major customers systems do not become year compliant on a timely basis  the company will have problems and incur delays in receiving and processing correct reimbursement 
if the systems on the diagnostic imaging equipment utilized by the company are not year compliant  the company may not be able to provide imaging services to patients 
if the company s vendors or suppliers of the company s necessary power  telecommunications  transportation and financial services  fail to provide the company with equipment and services  the company will be unable to provide services to its customers 
if any of these uncertainties were to occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
the company is unable to assess the likelihood of such events occurring or the extent of the effect on the company 
contingency plan the company has not yet established a contingency plan to address unavoidable year risks with internal information technology systems and with customers  vendors and other third parties  but it expects to create such a plan by june  safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements in this report  including without limitation  statements relating to the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and adequacy of resources  are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including without limitation the following i the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations and intentions are subject to change at any time at the discretion of the company  ii the company s plans and results of operations will be affected by the company s ability to manage its growth  iii the company s businesses are highly competitive and the entrance of new competitors into or the expansion of the operations by existing competitors in the company s markets and other changes could adversely affect the company s plans and results of operations  and iv other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no financial instruments which are subject to market risk 
although the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the interest rates on its investments  a hypothetical adverse decrease in the interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations because the majority of the company s investments are short term treasury bills 
a reduction in interest rates would reduce interest income by approximately  annually 
due to the short period to maturity  the company believes that the impact of a reduction in interest rates would not have a material effect on the carrying value of its available for sale securities
