unconsolidated affiliate timet timet files periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission the commission pursuant to the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the following information with respect to timet commission file number has been summarized from such reports which contain more detailed information concerning the business  results of operations and financial condition of timet 
general 
timet is one of the world s leading integrated producers of titanium sponge  ingot  slab and mill products and has the largest sales volume worldwide 
timet is the only integrated producer with major manufacturing facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
timet estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of world sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately half of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in diverse new and emerging uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive uses 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet  and strip  extrusions and wire 
timet believes it is among the lowest cost producers of titanium sponge and melt products due in part to its economies of scale  manufacturing expertise and investment in technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
timet believes that at least of the world s titanium sponge is produced by six companies 
timet intends to continue its focus on the following goals and objectives to change the traditional way business is conducted 
maximize the long term value of its core aerospace business by focusing on its basic strengths of sponge production  melting and forging of various shapes of titanium products  and by entering into strategic agreements with major titanium users to help mitigate the cyclicality of timet s aerospace business 

invest in strategic alliances  including joint ventures  acquisitions and entrepreneurial arrangements  as well as new markets  applications and products  to help reduce traditional dependence on the aerospace sector 

invest in technology  capacity and innovative projects aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity  quality  customer service and production capabilities 

stabilize the cost and supply of raw materials 

maintain a strong balance sheet 
outlook for the business environment in which timet finds itself in is substantially different from the market for titanium metal 
throughout  and much of  timet was producing titanium ingot and mill products for aerospace customers in contemplation of continuing record jet aircraft build rates that were expected to last through at least during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached  and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive widebody planes 
as aerospace customers continue to reduce inventories during and adjust to decreases in overall production rates  timet faces a decrease in demand from levels 
adding to the challenges in the aerospace sector  industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to the weakness in asian and other economies 
this has led to significant declines in volume and pricing 
these declines in timet s key markets occurred earlier than had been anticipated and at a time when timet was in the midst of a large capital expenditure program to modernize operations and to provide lower cost  more efficient capacity to meet peak demand for its products 
timet was also in the process of installing enterprise wide systems and software in order to standardize systems and information  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and also to help make its systems year yk ready 
assuming demand remains at currently expected levels and does not decrease or increase significantly in  timet currently expects net losses in at least the first two quarters and a return to modest profitability in the third or fourth quarter 
in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under new long term contracts referred to below will cause lower sales and gross profit margins 
on the expense side  timet s costs related to the new enterprise wide system and yk readiness program will continue to run at high levels throughout at the same time  the benefits of the new system will likely be modest in  particularly with the reduction in capacity utilization 
in the fourth quarter of  timet began implementing a plan of action designed to address current market conditions without abandoning key elements of its long term strategy  which it believes remain sound 
the action plan entails the following 
timet has permanently closed manufacturing facilities in verdi  nv  milbury  ma and pomona  ca 
timet has also temporarily or permanently closed parts of facilities in henderson  nv  morgantown  pa and witton  england 

timet has planned workforce reductions of approximately people in the united states and europe 
these reductions represent over of its mid worldwide workforce and have occurred at all levels within timet 
approximately two thirds of the reductions have been implemented as of february 
timet has merged all of its north american manufacturing operations into one operating unit to reduce costs and  at the same time  improve customer service 

reductions in plant overhead costs as well as in selling and administrative costs have been targeted 

supply contracts with key vendors have been renegotiated in order to reduce volumes and  to some extent  prices 

capital expenditures will be substantially cut back with exceptions of expenditures for environmental and safety purposes and funds needed to complete carryover projects begun in  including the capital needed to complete implementation of timet s business enterprise wide software system 
total capital expenditures are expected to be less than million in  compared to an aggregate of approximately million in and for the year  capital expenditures should decline further 

plans are already in place to reduce working capital  especially inventory and receivables  and timet believes it will see the benefits of this program beginning in the first quarter of 
timet has also obtained the agreement of nippon mining metals co  ltd 
and mitsui co  ltd 
to defer indefinitely timet s plan to purchase approximately of the outstanding stock of toho titanium company  ltd 
from nippon mining metals and mitsui at a purchase price of approximately million 
timet plans to proceed with the other elements of the previously announced strategic alliance between toho and timet  including study of the possible formation of a titanium hearth melting joint venture in japan and an anticipated long term agreement for the purchase of certain grades of titanium sponge by timet from toho 
in addition to its short term plan of actions as described above  timet has long term agreements with certain major aerospace customers  including the boeing company  rolls royce plc  united technologies corporation and related companies and wyman gordon company 
these agreements provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements generally at least for extended periods nine to ten years and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
these contracts are structured to provide incentives to both parties to lower timet s costs and share in the savings 
these contracts and others represent the core of timet s long term aerospace strategy and in and beyond are anticipated to account for more than of aerospace revenues 
these agreements should limit pricing volatility both up and down  for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace volume 
as a complement to the long term agreements entered into with timet s key customers  timet has also entered into agreements with certain key suppliers that were intended to assure anticipated raw material needs to satisfy production requirements for timet s key customers 
when the order flow did not meet expectations in  timet sought to restructure the terms of certain agreements 
timet is continuing to work with suppliers and believes that the contracts can be amended or terminated without any material adverse effect to timet 
with the new enterprise wide information system in place  and the assured minimum volume shares and prices of the aerospace contracts referred to above  timet can focus on cost reduction programs to increase timet s profitability to acceptable levels 
timet acquisitions and capital transactions during the past three years 
at the beginning of  timet was owned by tremont and its operations were conducted primarily in the united states 
during  timet expanded both geographically and operationally as a result of the acquisition of the titanium business of imi plc the imi titanium acquisition for stock  the acquisition of certain assets from axel johnson metals  inc the ajm acquisition for cash and certain smaller acquisitions in europe for cash 
timet also significantly improved its liquidity and capital structure during through its initial public offering of common stock and the issuance of company obligated manditorily redeemable preferred securities the convertible preferred securities through a subsidiary trust  timet capital trust i 
the imi titanium acquisition and timet s ipo together reduced tremont s ownership to in during  timet entered into a welded tube joint venture valtimet and in a castings joint venture wyman gordon titanium castings  both intended to combine best manufacturing practices and market coverage in these smaller markets 
in  timet acquired loterios spa to increase market share in industrial markets  particularly oil and gas  and provide increased geographic sales coverage in europe 
timet s strategy for investing in new markets and uses for titanium also includes investing in emerging businesses 
in this regard  during timet acquired equity interests in ti 
pro  llc  titanium memory systems  inc tms and ticomp  inc ti 
pro s focus is on developing the market for titanium in automobile racing and other specialty vehicle applications 
tms is continuing its development and production of a titanium substrate for use in computer hard disk drives 
ticomp is working on the development and production of layered titanium and composite materials for a variety of potential applications 
recent titanium industry conditions 
the titanium industry historically has derived the majority of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the historical fluctuations in performance of titanium companies  which had cyclical peaks in mill products shipments in  and and cyclical lows in and during the period  timet reported aggregate net income of million  which substantially more than offset the aggregate net losses of million it reported during the difficult period 
worldwide industry mill product shipments of approximately  metric tons in were above levels 
in  industry mill product shipments declined approximately  to approximately  metric tons  with a further decline  to approximately  metric tons  expected in timet believes that the reduction in demand for aerospace products is attributable to a decline in the number of aircraft forecast to be produced  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes  compounded by reductions in inventories as customers adjust to the decreases in overall production rates 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components such as rotor blades  discs  rings and engine cases  and air frame components  such as bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear and wing supports  can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
industry shipments to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of total aerospace demand of total titanium demand 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of over billion estimated in  compared to billion in and billion in timet understands commercial aircraft deliveries are expected to peak in current expected deliveries for and  while below the record levels of and  are still high by historical standards  and the current generations of airplanes use substantially more titanium than their predecessors 
timet can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will result in demand for titanium products 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
existing industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in new and emerging uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive uses 
several of these emerging applications represent potential growth opportunities that timet believes may reduce the industry s historical dependence on the aerospace market 
products and operations 
timet is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet  and strip and extrusions 
in  approximately of timet s sales were generated by timet s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
timet s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nv  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for most finished titanium products 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and meet customer specifications 
ingots and slabs are both sold to customers and further processed into mill products 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip and extrusions 
timet sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to timet s service centers 
timet s customers usually process timet s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of products  timet performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  ingot and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing and ultrasonic and x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that timet s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
timet is dependent upon the services of outside processors to perform important processing functions with respect to certain of its products 
in particular  timet currently relies upon a single processor to perform certain rolling steps with respect to some of its plate  sheet and strip products  and upon a single processor to perform certain finishing and conditioning steps with respect to its slab products 
although timet believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on timet s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
timet is exploring ways to lessen its dependence on any individual processor 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying materials 
timet processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
while timet is one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a portion of its sponge needs 
timet expects to provide approximately of its sponge needs from suppliers in japan and the former soviet union fsu 
timet has a long term agreement  concluded in  for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to support demand for both aerospace and non aerospace applications 
this sponge purchase agreement is for ten years  with firm pricing for the first five years subject to certain possible adjustments 
this contract provides for annual purchases by timet of  to  metric tons 
the parties have agreed in principle to a reduced minimum for  and timet currently expects to do the same for timet also has agreed in principle to purchase on a long term basis premium quality sponge produced in japan primarily to support production of material for critical rotating jet engine applications 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  africa south africa and sierra leone  india and the united states 
a majority of timet s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
timet believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which timet purchases its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
in addition  although timet believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that timet will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single source near timet s plant  but alternative suppliers are available 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
timet has agreed in principle to enter into long term agreements with certain suppliers for a substantial portion of its alloy requirements at fixed and or formula determined prices 
timet facilities 
in addition to its us sponge capacity discussed below  timet s worldwide melting capacity aggregates approximately  metric tons of world capacity  and its mill products capacity aggregates approximately  metric tons of world capacity 
approximately of timet s worldwide melting capacity is represented by electron beam cold hearth melting eb furnaces  by vacuum arc remelting var furnaces and by a vacuum induction melting vim furnace 
during much of the past three years  timet operated its major production facilities at high levels of practical capacity 
production levels and capacity utilization in will be lower than in timet s vdp sponge facility in henderson  nv is expected to operate at approximately of its annual practical capacity of  metric tons during  down from approximately in vdp sponge is used principally as a raw material for timet s ingot melting facilities in the us  with some vdp production expected to be used in europe 
due to changing market conditions for certain grades of sponge  timet reopened its original kroll leach process sponge plant in nevada in and is temporarily idling this facility at the end of march timet s raw materials processing facilities in morgantown  pa primarily process scrap used as melting feedstock  either in combination with sponge or separately 
timet s us melting facilities in henderson  nv  morgantown  pa and vallejo  ca produce ingots and slabs both sold to customers and used as feedstock for its mill products operations 
these melting facilities are expected to operate at approximately of aggregate capacity in  with certain production facilities temporarily idled 
titanium mill products are produced in the us principally at a forging and rolling facility in toronto  oh  which receives titanium ingots and slabs from timet s us melting facilities and titanium slabs and hot bands purchased from outside vendors 
timet uk s melting facility in witton  england produces var ingots sold to customers and used as raw material feedstock for its forging operations  also in witton 
the forging operation principally process the ingots into billet product for sale to customers and for further processing into bar and plate at timet s facility in waunarlwydd  wales 
uk melting and mill products production in is expected to be approximately and  respectively  of capacity 
capacity of owned timet savoie in ugine  france is provided under a long term contract with compagnie europeenne du zirconium cezus  sa cezus  which is the minority partner in timet savoie 
such capacity is  to a certain extent  dependent upon the level of activity in cezus zirconium business  which may from time to time provide timet savoie with capacity in excess of that contractually required to be provided 
during  timet savoie expects to operate at approximately of the maximum capacity required to be provided by cezus 
sponge for melting requirements in both the uk and france is purchased principally from suppliers in japan and kazakhstan  with a portion of uk requirements expected to be provided by timet s henderson  nv vdp plant 
distribution 
timet sells its products through its own sales force based in the us and europe  and through independent agents worldwide 
timet s marketing and distribution system also includes nine timet owned service centers five in the us and four in europe  which sell timet s products on a just in time basis 
timet believes that it has a competitive sales and cost advantage arising from the location of its production plants and service centers  which are in close proximity to major customers 
these centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products including bar and flat rolled sheet and strip 
timet believes its service centers give it a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
markets and customer base 
about of timet s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to other regions 
no single customer represents more than of timet s direct sales 
however  in  about of timet s mill product shipments sales were used by timet s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
timet expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace sector  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial aircraft boeing commercial airplane group and the airbus consortium and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric and snecma 
timet s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use timet s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on timet 
timet s order backlog was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  approximately of the year end backlog is expected to be delivered during although timet believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect timet s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines  but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to at the end of through various strategic relationships  timet seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
timet has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
timet also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  the fsu and china 
timet is one of four integrated producers in the world with integrated producers being considered as those that produce at least both sponge and ingot 
there are also a number of non integrated producers that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
timet believes that most producers will generally operate at lower capacity levels in than in  increasing price competition 
timet s principal competitors in aerospace markets are allegheny teledyne inc  rti international metals  inc 
formerly rmi titanium company and verkhanya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
timet competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  existing and prior duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent timet has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing such sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products from such countries for use in its own operations during recent years  the negative effect of these imports on timet has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated by the us government as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
titanium products for tariff purposes are broadly classified as either wrought or unwrought 
wrought products include bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing 
unwrought products include sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
starting in  imports of titanium wrought products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
in recent years  the gsp program has been subject to annual review and renewal and is currently scheduled to expire in the second quarter of in  gsp benefits to these russian products were suspended when the level of russian wrought products imports reached of all imports of titanium wrought products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products  and that petition was granted in june in addition  a petition was also filed to bring unwrought products under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan and ukraine to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
this petition concerning unwrought products has not been acted upon pending further investigation of the merits of such a change 
in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from countries of the fsu russia  kazakhstan and ukraine has for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
in addition  titanium sponge imports from japan were subject to a standing antidumping order  but no penalties had been attached in recent years 
in  the international trade commission itc revoked all outstanding antidumping orders on titanium sponge based upon a determination that changed circumstances in the industry did not warrant continuation of the orders 
timet has appealed that decision  with first hearings expected in the second quarter of pending the appeal  the orders remain revoked 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of timet 
however  timet has  in recent years  been one of the largest importers of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent timet remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to timet for these products to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to produce titanium products 
timet believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
timet s research and development activities are directed toward improving process technology  developing new alloys  enhancing the performance of timet s products in current applications  and searching for new uses of titanium products 
for example  one of timet s proprietary alloys  timetal r s  has been specified for a number of aerospace applications  including the boeing additionally  timetal lcb  a low cost beta alloy  is being tested for new non aerospace applications  and timetal has been introduced into the sporting goods markets 
timet conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson  nv laboratory  which timet believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton  england facility 
patents and trademarks 
timet holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
timet continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by timet do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
timet believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
as of december   timet employed approximately  persons  in the us and in europe  down approximately from a total of  at the end of during  timet expects to reduce employment by an additional persons  the vast majority of which reduction should occur during the first quarter 
timet s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nv and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  oh are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
employees at timet s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
over of the salaried and hourly employees at timet s european facilities are members of various european labor unions  generally under annual agreements  certain of which are still under negotiation for the uswa engaged in a nine month work stoppage at timet s henderson facility in and in a three month stoppage at the toronto facility in while timet currently has long term contracts with the uswa and considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect timet s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
timet s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include  among others  the federal clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
timet uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at timet s henderson  nv facility  timet uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
timet has used such substances throughout the history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in timet s operations 
timet s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to timet s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
timet s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws are generally less stringent than us laws and which have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on timet 
there can be no assurance that such foreign laws will not become more stringent 
timet believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker safety laws 
timet s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
from time to time  timet may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties  but to date no material penalties have been incurred 
timet incurred capital expenditures for health  safety and environmental protection and compliance of approximately million in each of and  and its capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters

unconsolidated affiliate nl nl files periodic reports with the commission pursuant to the exchange act  as amended 
the following information with respect to nl commission file number has been summarized from such reports  which contain more detailed information concerning the business  results of operations and financial condition of nl 
g eneral 
nl conducts its continuing operations through its principal wholly owned subsidiary  kronos  inc in january  the specialty chemicals business of rheox  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of nl  was sold for million to elementis plc  including million attributable to a five year agreement by nl not to compete in the rheological products business 
see rheox discontinued operations for related discussion 
kronos is the world s fourth largest producer of titanium dioxide pigments tio with an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume in approximately one half of kronos sales volume was in europe  where kronos is the second largest producer of tio nl s objective is to maximize total shareholder returns by focusing on i acquiring additional tio production capacity  ii investing in certain cost effective debottlenecking projects to increase tio production capacity and efficiency  iii controlling costs  iv enhancing its capital structure and v considering mergers or acquisitions within the chemical industry 
tio products and operations 
titanium dioxide pigments are chemical products used for imparting whiteness  brightness and opacity to a wide range of products  including paints  plastics  paper  fibers and ceramics 
tio is considered a quality of life product with demand affected by gross domestic product in various regions of the world 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
nl s average tio selling prices increased during the first three quarters of  continuing the upturn in prices that began in the second quarter of industry wide demand for tio declined in  with second half demand lower than first half demand 
kronos sales volume decreased from its record sales volume in reflecting lower sales volume in asia and latin america 
kronos european sales volume in the second half of was lower than the first half of nl expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  but this will depend upon global economic conditions 
prices in the fourth quarter of were even with prices in the third quarter of and the outlook for prices in is uncertain 
nl s expectations as to the future prospects of the tio industry and prices are based upon a number of factors beyond nl s control  including continued worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the market place  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from nl s expectations  industry and nl performance could be unfavorably affected 
kronos has an estimated share of european tio sales volume and an estimated share of north american tio sales volume 
per capita consumption of tio in the united states and western europe far exceeds that in other areas of the world and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of tio significant tio consumption could emerge in eastern europe  the far east or china if the economies in these countries develop to the point where quality of life products  including tio  are in greater demand 
nl believes that  due to its strong presence in western europe  it is well positioned to participate in growth in consumption of tio in eastern europe 
nl believes that there are no effective substitutes for tio however  extenders such as kaolin clays  calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used in a number of kronos markets 
generally  extenders are used to reduce to some extent the utilization of higher cost tio the use of extenders has not significantly changed anticipated tio consumption over the past decade because extenders generally have  to date  failed to match the performance characteristics of tio as a result  nl believes that the use of extenders will not materially alter the growth of the tio business in the foreseeable future 
kronos currently produces over different tio grades  sold under the kronos and titanox trademarks  which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers specific requirements 
kronos major customers include domestic and international paint  plastics and paper manufacturers 
kronos is one of the world s leading producers and marketers of tio kronos and its distributors and agents sell and provide technical services for its products to over  customers with the majority of sales in europe and north america 
kronos international operations are conducted through kronos international  inc  a germany based holding company formed in to manage and coordinate nl s manufacturing operations in germany  canada  belgium and norway  and its sales and marketing activities in over countries worldwide 
kronos and its predecessors have produced and marketed tio in north america and europe for over years 
as a result  kronos believes that it has developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture  sale  shipment and service of its products in domestic and international markets 
by volume  approximately one half of kronos tio sales was to europe  with to north america and the balance to export markets 
kronos is also engaged in the mining and sale of ilmenite ore a raw material used in the sulfate pigment production process described below  and the manufacture and sale of iron based water treatment chemicals derived from co products of the pigment production processes 
water treatment chemicals are used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater  and in the manufacture of iron pigments 
tio manufacturing process and raw materials 
tio is manufactured by kronos using both the chloride process and the sulfate process 
approximately two thirds of kronos current production capacity is based on its chloride process which generates less waste than the sulfate process 
although most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  chloride process pigments are generally preferred in certain coatings and plastics applications  and sulfate process pigments are generally preferred for certain paper  fibers and ceramics applications 
due to environmental factors and customer considerations  the proportion of tio industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments in the past few years  and chloride process production facilities in represented almost of industry capacity 
kronos produced a record  metric tons of tio in  compared to the previous record of  metric tons produced in and  metric tons in kronos maintained near full capacity production rates throughout and in response to strong demand in and early kronos million debottlenecking expansion of its leverkusen  germany chloride process plant increased annual production capacity by approximately  metric tons in kronos believes its current annual attainable production capacity is approximately  metric tons  including its one half interest in the joint venture owned louisiana plant see tio manufacturing joint venture 
the primary raw materials used in the tio chloride production process are chlorine  coke and titanium containing feedstock derived from beach sand ilmenite and natural rutile ore 
chlorine and coke are available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally in australia  south africa  canada  india and the united states 
kronos purchases slag refined from beach sand ilmenite from richards bay iron and titanium proprietary limited south africa under a long term supply contract that expires at the end of natural rutile ore  another chloride feedstock  is purchased primarily from rgc mineral sands limited australia  a wholly owned subsidiary of westralian sands limited australia  under a long term supply contract that also expires at the end of nl does not expect to encounter difficulties obtaining long term extensions to existing supply contracts prior to the expiration of the contracts 
raw materials purchased under these contracts and extensions thereof are expected to meet kronos chloride feedstock requirements over the next several years 
the primary raw materials used in the tio sulfate production process are sulfuric acid and titanium containing feedstock derived primarily from rock and beach sand ilmenite 
sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers 
titanium containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers around the world 
currently  the principal active sources are located in norway  canada  australia  india and south africa 
as one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate process pigments  kronos operates a rock ilmenite mine in norway which provided all of kronos feedstock for its european sulfate process pigment plants in for its canadian plant  kronos also purchases sulfate grade slag from qit fer et titane inc under a long term supply contract which expires in nl believes the availability of titanium containing feedstock for both the chloride and sulfate processes is adequate for the next several years 
nl does not expect to experience any interruptions of its raw material supplies because of its long term supply contracts 
however  political and economic instability in certain countries from which nl purchases its raw material supplies could adversely affect the availability of such feedstock 
tio manufacturing joint venture 
subsidiaries of kronos and tioxide group  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of imperial chemicals industries plc ici  each own a interest in a manufacturing joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc 
lpc owns and operates a chloride process tio plant located in lake charles  louisiana 
production from the plant is shared equally by kronos and tioxide the partners pursuant to separate offtake agreements 
a supervisory committee  composed of four members  two of whom are appointed by each partner  directs the business and affairs of lpc including production and output decisions 
two general managers  one appointed and compensated by each partner  manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee 
the manufacturing joint venture is intended to be operated on a break even basis and  accordingly  kronos transfer price for its share of tio produced is equal to its share of the joint venture s production costs and interest expense  if any 
kronos share of the production costs are reported as cost of sales as the related tio acquired from the joint venture is sold  and its share of the joint venture s interest expense is reported as a component of interest expense 
c ompetition 
the tio industry is highly competitive 
during the early s  supply of tio exceeded demand  primarily due to new chloride process capacity coming on stream 
relative supply demand relationships  which had a favorable impact on industry wide prices during the late s  had a negative impact during the early s 
prices improved in the mid s with a mini peak in the first half of prices declined until the first quarter of  when selling prices of tio began to increase as a result of increased demand 
sales volume in europe remained strong in the first half of  but moderated in the second half 
sales volume in in north america was even with  while sales volume to export markets declined  especially in asia 
average selling prices increased in versus  but fourth quarter prices were even with the third quarter of as worldwide demand softened 
nl expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  but this will depend upon global economic conditions 
as a result  the outlook for prices in is uncertain 
no assurance can be given that demand or price trends will conform to nl s expectations 
see tio products and operations for a description of certain risks and uncertainties within the tio industry 
capacity additions that are the result of construction of greenfield plants in the worldwide tio market require significant capital expenditures and substantial lead time  typically three to five years in nl s experience 
no greenfield plants have been announced  but industry capacity can be expected to increase as kronos and its competitors debottleneck existing plants 
based on the factors described under the caption tio products and operations above  nl expects that the average annual increase in industry capacity from announced debottlenecking projects will be less than the average annual demand growth for tio during the next three to five years 
kronos competes primarily on the basis of price  product quality and technical service  and the availability of high performance pigment grades 
although certain tio grades are considered specialty pigments  the majority of kronos grades and substantially all of kronos production are considered commodity pigments with price generally being the most significant competitive factor 
during kronos had an estimated share of worldwide tio sales volume  and kronos believes that it is the leading seller of tio in a number of countries  including germany and canada 
kronos principal competitors are ei du pont de nemours co 
dupont  ici tioxide  millennium chemicals  inc millennium inorganic chemicals  inc  kerr mcgee corporation  kemira oy  and ishihara sangyo kaisha  ltd 
in  rhone poulenc sold its thann et mulhouse ltd 
french tio operations to millennium 
also in  bayer ag sold approximately of its european tio operations to kerr mcgee and all of its brazilian operations to millennium 
kronos six largest competitors have estimated individual shares of tio production capacity ranging from to  and an estimated aggregate share of worldwide tio production volume 
dupont has about one half of total us tio production capacity and is kronos principal north american competitor 
r heox discontinued operations 
on january   the specialty chemicals business of rheox was sold to elementis plc for million  including million attributable to a five year agreement by nl not to compete in the rheological products business 
as a result of the sale  nl has reported its rheox business as discontinued operations 
following the sale of its net assets  rheox  inc was renamed nl capital corporation nlcc 
the majority of the million after tax proceeds has been used to reduce nl s outstanding indebtedness 
r esearch and development 
nl s expenditures for research and development and certain technical support programs  excluding discontinued operations  have averaged approximately million annually during the past three years 
research and development activities are conducted principally at the leverkusen  germany facility 
such activities are directed primarily toward improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes  improving product quality and strengthening kronos competitive position by developing new pigment applications 
patents and trademarks 
patents held for products and production processes are believed to be important to nl and to the continuing business activities of kronos 
nl continually seeks patent protection for its technical developments  principally in the united states  canada and europe  and from time to time enters into licensing arrangements with third parties 
nl s major trademarks  including kronos and titanox  are protected by registration in the united states and elsewhere with respect to those products it manufactures and sells 
foreign operations 
nl s chemical businesses have operated in international markets since the s 
most of kronos current production capacity is located in europe and canada 
approximately three quarters of nl s consolidated sales  excluding discontinued operations  were to non us customers  including to customers in areas other than europe and canada 
sales to customers in asia accounted for of s consolidated net sales 
foreign operations are subject to  among other things  currency exchange rate fluctuations and nl s results of operations have in the past been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on nl s results of operations are discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
political and economic uncertainties in certain of the countries in which nl operates may expose it to risk of loss 
nl does not believe that there is currently any likelihood of material loss through political or economic instability  seizure  nationalization or similar event 
nl cannot predict  however  whether events of this type in the future could have a material effect on its operations 
nl s manufacturing and mining operations are also subject to extensive and diverse environmental regulation in each of the foreign countries in which they operate 
see regulatory and environmental matters 
c ustomer base and seasonality 
nl believes that neither its aggregate sales nor those of any of its principal product groups are concentrated in or materially dependent upon any single customer or small group of customers 
neither nl s business as a whole nor that of any of its principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent 
due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet the spring and summer painting season demand  tio sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
employees 
as of december   nl employed approximately  persons  excluding the joint venture employees and discontinued operations  with approximately employees in the united states and approximately  at sites outside the united states 
hourly employees in production facilities worldwide  including the tio manufacturing joint venture  are represented by a variety of labor unions  with labor agreements having various expiration dates 
nl believes its labor relations are good 
r egulatory and environmental matters and litigation 
certain of nl s businesses are and have been engaged in the handling  manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws 
as with other companies engaged in similar businesses  certain past and current operations and products of nl have the potential to cause environmental or other damage 
nl has implemented and continues to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks 
the policy of nl is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all its facilities and to strive to improve its environmental performance 
it is possible that future developments  such as stricter requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  could adversely affect nl s production  handling  use  storage  transportation  sale or disposal of such substances as well as nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
nl s us manufacturing operations are governed by federal environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations  principally the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the occupational safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the toxic substances control act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act cercla  as well as the state counterparts of these statutes 
nl believes the louisiana plant owned and operated by the joint venture is in substantial compliance with applicable requirements of these laws or compliance orders issued thereunder 
following the sale of its specialty chemicals business  nl has no us plants other than lpc 
from time to time  nl s facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under such statutes 
resolution of such matters typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution may result in the payment of penalties  but to date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
nl s european and canadian production facilities operate in an environmental regulatory framework in which governmental authorities typically are granted broad discretionary powers which allow them to issue operating permits required for the plants to operate 
nl believes that all its plants are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
while the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in europe vary from country to country  a common regulatory denominator is provided by the european union the eu 
germany and belgium are members of the eu and follow its initiatives 
norway  although not a member  generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the eu 
nl believes that kronos is in substantial compliance with agreements reached with european environmental authorities and with an eu directive to control the effluents produced by tio production facilities 
nl has a contract with a third party to treat certain of its leverkusen and nordenham  germany sulfate process effluents 
either party may terminate the contract after giving four years advance notice with regard to the nordenham plant 
under certain circumstances  kronos may terminate the contract after giving six months notice with respect to treatment of effluents from the leverkusen plant 
in order to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmosphere consistent with applicable environmental regulations  kronos completed the installation of off gas desulfurization systems in at its norwegian and german plants at a cost of million 
the manufacturing joint venture completed the installation of a million off gas desulfurization system at the louisiana plant in nl s capital expenditures related to its ongoing environmental protection and improvement programs are currently expected to be approximately million in and million in nl has been named as a defendant  potentially responsible party prp  or both  pursuant to cercla and similar state laws in approximately governmental and private actions associated with waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  or its subsidiaries  or their predecessors  certain of which are on the us environmental protection agency s us epa superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
these proceedings seek cleanup costs  damages for personal injury or property damage  and or damages for injury to natural resources 
certain of these proceedings involve claims for substantial amounts 
although nl may be jointly and severally liable for such costs  in most cases it is only one of a number of prps who may also be jointly and severally liable 
the extent of cercla liability cannot accurately be determined until the remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs is complete  the us epa issues a record of decision and costs are allocated among prps 
the extent of liability under analogous state cleanup statutes and for common law equivalents are subject to similar uncertainties 
nl believes it has provided adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs for cercla matters and other environmental liabilities 
at december  nl had accrued million for those environmental matters which are reasonably estimable 
nl determines the amount of accrual on a quarterly basis by analyzing and estimating the range of possible costs to nl 
such costs include  among other things  remedial investigations  monitoring  studies  cleanup  removal and remediation 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
nl has estimated that the upper end of the range of reasonably possible costs to nl for sites for which it is possible to estimate costs is approximately million 
nl s estimate of such liability has not been discounted to present value and nl has not recognized any potential insurance recoveries 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed either accrued amounts or the upper end of the range for sites for which estimates have been made  and no assurance can be given that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no estimate presently can be made 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes respecting site cleanup costs or allocation of such costs among prps  or a determination that nl is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated by nl to be required for such matters 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future 
more detailed descriptions of certain legal proceedings relating to environmental matters are set forth below 
in july the united states filed an action in the us district court for the southern district of illinois against nl and others united states of america v 
nl industries  inc  et al  civ

the us epa has issued an order to nl to perform a removal action at nl s former facility involved in the state of illinois case 
nl is complying with the order 
residents in the vicinity of nl s former philadelphia lead chemicals plant commenced a class action allegedly comprised of over  individuals seeking medical monitoring and damages allegedly caused by emissions from the plant wagner  et al 
v 
anzon  inc and nl industries  inc  no 
 court of common pleas  philadelphia county 
the complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages from nl and the current owner of the plant  and alleged causes of action for  among other things  negligence  strict liability  and nuisance

nos 
  and the consolidated action is a putative class action seeking cercla response costs  including cleanup and medical monitoring  declaratory and injunctive relief and civil penalties for alleged violations of the rcra  and also asserting pendent common law claims for strict liability  trespass  nuisance and punitive damages 
the court dismissed the common law claims without prejudice  dismissed two of the three rcra claims as against nl with prejudice  and stayed the case pending the outcome of the state court litigation 
at a municipal and industrial waste disposal site in batavia  new york  nl and approximately others have been identified as prps 
the us epa has divided the site into two operable units 
pursuant to an administrative consent order entered into with the us epa  nl conducted a rifs for operable unit one  the closure of the industrial waste disposal section of the landfill 
nl s rifs costs were approximately million 
in june  the us epa issued the record of decision for operable unit one  which is estimated by the us epa to cost approximately million 
in september  the us epa and certain prps entered into an administrative order on consent for the remedial design phase of the remedy for operable unit one and the design phase is proceeding 
nl and other prps entered into an interim cost sharing arrangement for this phase of work 
nl and the other prps have completed the work comprising operable unit two the extension of the municipal water supply with the exception of annual operation and maintenance 
the us epa also has claimed it has incurred approximately million in past costs from the prps 
nl and the other prps have submitted to a nonbinding allocation process  as a result of which nl was assigned a share of future site liability 
l ead pigment litigation 
nl was formerly involved in the manufacture of lead pigments for use in paint and lead based paint 
nl has been named as a defendant or third party defendant in various legal proceedings alleging that nl and other manufacturers are responsible for personal injury and property damage allegedly associated with the use of lead pigments 
nl is vigorously defending such litigation 
considering nl s previous involvement in the lead pigment and lead based paint businesses  there can be no assurance that additional litigation  similar to that described below  will not be filed 
in addition  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been enacted or proposed that seek to a impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and b effectively overturn court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage 
while no legislation or regulations have been enacted to date that are expected to have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  the imposition of market share liability could have such an effect 
nl has not accrued any amounts for the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation is without merit 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
in and  the housing authority of new orleans hano filed third party complaints for indemnity and or contribution against nl  other alleged manufacturers of lead pigment together with nl  the pigment manufacturers and the lead industries association the lia in actions commenced by residents of hano units seeking compensatory and punitive damages for injuries allegedly caused by lead pigment 
the actions  which were pending in the civil district court for the parish of orleans  state of louisiana  were dismissed by the district court in subsequently  hano agreed to consolidate all the cases and appealed 
in march  the louisiana court of appeals  fourth circuit  dismissed hano s appeal as untimely with respect to three of these cases 
with respect to the other cases included in the appeal  the court of appeals reversed the lower court decision dismissing the cases 
these cases were remanded to the district court for further proceedings 
in november  the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in one of the remaining cases and in june  the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment in several of the remaining cases 
after such grant  only two cases remain pending and have been inactive since  hall v 
hano  et al

in february the motion was denied 
in july  the denial of defendants two summary judgment motions on the fraud claim were affirmed by the appellate division 
in december  plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their claims of market share  alternative liability  enterprise liability  and concert of action 
in february  claims for plaintiffs new york city and new york city health and hospital corporation dismissed with prejudice all their claims and were no longer parties to the case 
also in february  the new york city housing authority dismissed with prejudice all of its claims except for claims for damages relating to two housing projects 
briefing on the december motion and limited discovery are proceeding 
in august  nl was served with an amended complaint in jackson  et al 
v 
the glidden co  et al  court of common pleas  cuyahoga county  cleveland  ohio case no

defendants filed motions to dismiss the nuisance and consumer protection act claims in the complaint in march nl believes that the foregoing lead pigment actions are without merit and intends to continue to deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability and to defend such actions vigorously 
nl has filed actions seeking declaratory judgment and other relief against various insurance carriers with respect to costs of defense and indemnity coverage for certain of its environmental and lead pigment litigation 
nl industries  inc v 
commercial union insurance cos  et al  nos 
 hls district court of new jersey 
the action relating to lead pigment litigation defense costs filed in may against commercial union insurance company commercial union seeks to recover defense costs incurred in the city of new york lead pigment case and two other cases that have since been resolved in nl s favor 
in july  the court granted nl s motion for summary judgment and ordered commercial union to pay nl s reasonable defense costs for such cases 
in june  nl filed an amended complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey against commercial union seeking to recover costs incurred in defending four additional lead pigment cases which have since been resolved in nl s favor 
in august  the court granted nl s motion for summary judgment and ordered commercial union to pay the reasonable costs of defending those cases 
in july  the court entered judgment on the order requiring commercial union to pay previously incurred nl costs in defending those cases 
in september  the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed and remanded for further consideration the decision by the trial court that commercial union was obligated to pay nl s reasonable defense costs in certain of the lead pigment cases 
the trial court had made its decision applying new jersey law  the appeals court concluded that new york and not new jersey law applied and remanded the case to the trial court for a determination under new york law 
on remand from the court of appeals  the trial court in april granted nl s motion for summary judgment  finding that commercial union had a duty to defend nl in the four lead paint cases which were the subject of nl s second amended complaint 
the court also issued a partial ruling on commercial union s motion for summary judgment in which it sought allocation of defense costs and contribution from nl and two other insurance carriers in connection with the three lead paint actions on which the court had granted nl summary judgment in the court ruled that commercial union is entitled to receive such contribution from nl and the two carriers  but reserved ruling with respect to the relative contributions to be made by each of the parties  including contributions by nl that may be required with respect to periods in which it was self insured and contributions from one carrier which were reinsured by a former subsidiary of nl  the reinsurance costs of which nl may ultimately be required to bear 
in june  nl reached a settlement in principle with its insurers regarding allocation of defense costs in the lead pigment cases in which reimbursement of defense costs had been sought 
other than granting motions for summary judgment brought by two excess liability insurance carriers  which contended that their policies contained absolute pollution exclusion language  and certain summary judgment motions regarding policy periods  the court has not made any final rulings on defense costs or indemnity coverage with respect to nl s pending environmental litigation 
in september  the us court of appeals for the third circuit issued an opinion regarding which states laws applied to the various sites for which environmental coverage is sought  and remanded the case to the trial court 
the court has not made any final ruling on indemnity coverage in the lead pigment litigation 
no trial dates have been set 
other than rulings to date  the issue of whether insurance coverage for defense costs or indemnity or both will be found to exist depends upon a variety of factors  and there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will exist in other cases 
nl has not considered any potential insurance recoveries for lead pigment or environmental litigation in determining related accruals

in addition  the information included in note to the consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference 
in  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the arkansas division of pollution control and ecology in connection with certain alleged water discharge permit violations at one of several abandoned barite mining sites in arkansas 
the settlement agreement  in addition to requiring the payment in of a  penalty  required the company to undertake a remediation reclamation program which was substantially completed at a total cost of approximately million 
another of the sites is currently being evaluated by the us epa 
based upon its evaluation  the us epa could require the owners to take investigatory or remedial action at this site  however  the company believes that to the extent it has any additional liability for remediation at this site  it is only one of a number of apparently solvent potentially responsible parties that would ultimately share in any such costs 
as of december   the company had accrued approximately million related to these matters 
the company records liabilities related to environmental remediation obligations when estimated future expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by the company at its non operating facilities  or a determination that the company is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites  could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known or where no estimate can presently be made 
further  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future

income taxes 
the company s income tax rate in varied from the us statutory rate principally because of a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance

tremont periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  principally its investments in nl and timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a writedown which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
the company s per share net carrying amount of its investment in nl at december  was per share  compared to a per share market price of at that date 
the company s per share net carrying value of its investment in timet at december  was per share  compared to a per share market price of at that date 
as of march   the market price for timet common stock was per share and for nl common stock was per share 
the company believes stock market prices are not necessarily indicative of a company s enterprise value or the value that could be realized if the company were sold 
after considering what it believes to be all relevant factors including  among other things  the relatively short period of time that the market price has been less than the company s per share investment in timet  timet s operating results  financial position and prospects  the company concluded that there has been no other than temporary decline in value of the company s investment in timet below its net carrying value at december  as discussed above  the company s major assets are its interests in nl tio and timet titanium metals 
it is possible  should the tio or titanium metals industries in general  or nl or timet specifically  encounter a prolonged downturn  or suffer other unforeseen adverse events  that the value of the company s investment in nl  timet or both could decline to a level that could warrant a writedown 
the company will continue to monitor and evaluate its interests in nl and timet based upon  among other things  their respective results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and business outlook 
in the event tremont determines that any decline in value of its interests below their net carrying value has occurred which is other than temporary  it would report an appropriate writedown at that time 
y ear yk 
year issues exist because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to treat the year properly could cause systems to process critical financial  manufacturing and operational information incorrectly 
tremont  as a holding company  does not itself have numerous applications or systems 
the company i has completed an initial assessment of potential yk issues in its information systems  ii is in the process of determining  prioritizing and implementing remedial actions  including testing  and iii will develop contingency plans in the event internal or external yk issues are not resolved by the company s june  target date for completion 
the cost for yk readiness is not expected to be material to the company 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by tremont or its key service providers to become yk ready would be a short term inability on the part of tremont to process banking transactions 
yk issues related to nl and timet are discussed below 
timet the company s equity in timet s earnings differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s december  ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of changes in tremont s level of ownership of timet in and and because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in timet 
amortization of such basis differences in timet generally increases earnings  and decreases losses  attributable to timet as reported by tremont 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of timet has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by timet file no 
 which reports contain more detailed information concerning timet  including complete financial statements 
general 
the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately two thirds of us and to of worldwide titanium mill products consumption  and has had a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
throughout  and much of  timet was producing titanium ingot and mill products for aerospace customers in contemplation of continuing record jet aircraft build rates then expected to last through at least during the second half of  it became evident to timet that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive widebody planes 
as aerospace customers reduce inventories during and adjust to decreases in overall production rates  timet faces a decrease in demand from levels 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies 
timet estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons and decreased in to approximately  metric tons 
timet also estimates industry mill product shipments will further decline in to approximately  metric tons 
timet s order backlog decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  and from million at december  timet defines order backlog as firm purchase orders which are generally subject to cancellation by the customer upon payment of specified charges 
timet expects that production levels  capacity utilization  sales volumes  sales prices  gross profit margins and operating income margins excluding special charges will all be lower in than they were in assuming demand remains at currently expected levels and does not decrease or increase significantly in  timet currently expects net losses in at least the first two quarters of and a return to modest profitability in the third or fourth quarter 
in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under new long term contracts with key aerospace customers will cause lower sales and gross profit margins 
timet has implemented plans to address the current market conditions  as more fully described in item business unconsolidated affiliate timet outlook for special restructuring charges in as a result of timet s action plans were million  as discussed below 
expenses related to implementing and maintaining timet s business enterprise system and to addressing yk issues are expected to remain high in years ended december  in millions net sales titanium melted and mill products other eliminations operating income titanium melted and mill products other general corporate income  net interest expense pretax income income taxes minority interest convertible 
preferred securities other minority interest net income tremont s equity in timet s income mill product shipments volume metric tons    average price per kilogram timet operates in two segments i titanium melted and mill products  its principal segment  and ii other  which consists primarily of timet s titanium castings operations that were combined in a joint venture during sales and operating income compared with net sales of the titanium melted and mill products segment in were below levels primarily due to lower volumes due to reduced demand during the last half of the year in both aerospace and industrial markets  as described above 
mill product shipment volume for the year declined to  metric tons 
selling prices on shipments were relatively flat  in large part due to prices on orders entered prior to the decline in demand 
average prices on shipments are expected to be to lower than in  reflecting both provisions of long term agreements effective in and increased price competition on non contract business 
net sales of the other segment were down primarily as a result of timet s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july total cost of sales was of sales in  comparable to of sales in cost of sales is expected to be a higher percent of sales in  as the effect of lower average selling prices  lower volumes and higher depreciation will more than offset the positive effect of timet s cost saving initiatives 
selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were higher than in  in both total dollar and percent of sales terms  up from  in large part due to information technology costs  including implementation of timet s enterprise wide business information system and addressing yk issues 
equity in earnings of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment were million in compared to a loss of 
million in  principally due to improved earnings of valtimet 
equity losses of the other segment were million in  million higher than in  as certain ventures were held for the full year  compared to a part year in operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million and the other segment included million of charges 
timet s restructuring plan included the permanent closure of three plants  the permanent or temporary closures of parts of three other plants  the merger of all north american manufacturing operations into one operating unit and the termination or layoff of people  or approximately of timet s worldwide workforce 
components of the restructuring charge are summarized below 
segment melted and mill other total products in millions property and equipment pension costs sfas no 
personnel severance and benefits 
other exit costs  principally related to leased facilities substantially all of the property and equipment loss relates to items sold  scrapped or abandoned  with disposition already substantially complete 
depreciation of equipment not impaired and only temporarily idled was not suspended 
the pension charge relates to the actuarial valuation of accelerated defined benefits of employees to be terminated 
at december   of the personnel reductions had been accomplished with substantially all of the remainder to be accomplished in the first quarter of other exit costs relate primarily to carrying costs on leased facilities  which leases have or will be terminated  assumed or expire by mid year 
of the million personnel and other exit costs accrued  million had been paid at year end 
most of the remaining accrued costs will be paid during the first half of  although certain payments  for items such as benefit continuation for terminated employees  will be paid later 
operating income compared with the significant improvement in sales  operating income and operating margins of the titanium melted and mill products segment in over were driven by price and volume increases for titanium products in both commercial aerospace and other markets 
sales volume of titanium mill products increased in  to approximately  metric tons 
average selling prices in increased  reflecting both the pass through of cost increases  particularly raw material costs  and real price improvement associated with increased market demand 
the other segment results declined significantly in relative to in large part due to deterioration in the golf castings market 
total cost of sales in was of sales versus of sales in  reflecting the real price improvement in sales  higher volumes and generally higher operating levels at timet s plants 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses as a percent of sales in were higher than in primarily due to higher information technology and market product development costs 
equity in earnings of joint ventures in was million and consisted principally of timet s interest in titanium hearth technologies tht  reported by the equity method prior to the ajm acquisition in october operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million related to the imi acquisition  million of which related to compensation for services in connection with the acquisition  with the remainder related principally to integration and consolidation of certain facilities 
european operations 
timet has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom  with smaller operations in france  italy and germany 
titanium is a worldwide market and the factors influencing timet s us and europe operations are substantially the same 
the relative changes in sales to customers in europe increased compared to and in the us declined was impacted  respectively  by the acquisition of loterios in april and deconsolidation of timet s castings operations in july sales of timet s european subsidiaries represented approximately of timet s consolidated net sales in approximately one half of these european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally major european currencies 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for timet s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of timet s european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  thus  the us dollar value of these subsidiaries sales and costs denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  including sales and costs denominated in us dollars  are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of timet s european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
timet s export sales from the united states are denominated in us dollars and as such are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the u 
s 
dollar sales and purchases of timet s european operations described above provide some natural hedge of non functional currencies  and timet does not use currency contracts to hedge its currency exposures 
net currency transaction translation gains losses included in income were less than 
million in each of the past three years 
at december   timet s consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of us dollar cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and borrowings 
exchange rates among european currencies including the french franc  italian lira and german mark but excluding the uk pound sterling became fixed relative to each other as a result of the new european currency unit euro effective in costs associated with modifications of systems to handle euro denominated transactions have not been significant 
general corporate income 
general corporate income consists principally of earnings on corporate cash equivalents and varies with cash levels and interest rates 
such income in is expected to be lower than in interest expense 
interest expense was lower in than  principally due to lower average borrowing levels 
while average borrowing levels increased in over  interest rates declined and interest capitalized increased 
interest expense in is expected to be higher than in due to higher average borrowing levels and lower levels of interest capitalization due to lower capital expenditures 
minority interest 
annual dividend expense related to the convertible preferred securities  issued in november  approximates million and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by cezus 
income taxes 
timet operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income can impact timet s overall effective tax rate 
in and  timet s income tax rate also varied from the us statutory rate due to reductions in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to current year utilization of tax attributes and a million reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from a change in estimate of the net operating loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax carryforwards that would more likely than not be realized in the future 
for financial reporting purposes  timet has recognized all of its net operating loss carryforwards 
y ear year issues exist because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to treat the year properly could cause systems to process critical financial  manufacturing and operational information incorrectly 
most of timet s information systems have been replaced in connection with the implementation of timet s business enterprise system  the initial implementation of which was substantially completed with the rollout of the system to the uk in february the cost of the new system  including related equipment and networks  aggregated approximately million in million capital  million expense with an additional million to million expected to be incurred in timet  with the help of outside specialists and consultants i has substantially completed an initial assessment of potential yk issues in its non information systems eg  its manufacturing and communication systems  as well as in those information systems that were not replaced by the new business enterprise wide system  ii is in the process of determining  prioritizing and implementing remedial actions  including testing  and iii will develop contingency plans in the event internal or external yk issues are not resolved by timet s june  target date for completion 
timet s yk readiness varies by location 
some locations have completed their internal yk readiness plans while others are in the midst of remediation and testing 
at this time  most sites anticipate completing their respective yk readiness plans by the june target date 
however  remediation of some items at the henderson  nv site  and possibly others  could be delayed beyond the june target date 
timet expended approximately million on these specific non information system yk issues in  principally embedded system technology  and expects to incur approximately million on such issues in timet s evaluation of potential yk exposures related to key suppliers and customers is also in process and will continue throughout although timet believes its key information systems will be yk ready before the end of  it cannot yet fully predict the outcome or success of the yk readiness programs related to certain of its embedded manufacturing systems or those comparable systems of its suppliers or customers 
timet also cannot predict whether it will find additional problems that would result in unplanned upgrades of applications after june or even december as a result of these uncertainties  timet cannot predict the impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows or operations resulting from yk failures in systems that timet directly or indirectly relies upon 
should timet s yk readiness plan not be successful or be delayed beyond december  the consequences to timet could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce titanium metal products at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include impeded communications or power supplies  slower transaction processing and financial reporting  and potential liability to third parties 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by timet or its key suppliers or customers to become yk ready would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of timet s facilities and a short term inability on the part of timet to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
nl industries the company s interest in nl is reported by the equity method 
valhi and tremont together may be deemed to control nl 
the information included below relating to the financial position  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources of nl has been summarized from reports filed with the commission by nl file no 
 which reports contain more detailed information concerning nl  including complete financial statements on nl s historical basis of accounting 
tremont s equity in earnings of nl differs from the amount that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to nl s separately reported earnings  because of changes in tremont s level of ownership of nl in and the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with the acquisitions of its interest in nl 
amortization of such basis differences generally reduces earnings  and increases losses  attributable to nl as reported by tremont 
nl s continuing operations are conducted by kronos in the tio business segment

in billing currency terms  kronos average tio selling prices were higher than in average selling prices in the fourth quarter of were higher than the fourth quarter of and even with the third quarter of selling prices at the end of were higher than year end levels 
operating income in was higher than  primarily due to record production and sales volumes and the german trade capital tax income  partially offset by lower average tio selling prices 
the million of german trade capital tax refunds received in relates to years prior to and includes interest 
the german tax authorities were required to remit refunds based on i recent court decisions which reduced the trade capital tax base and ii prior agreements between nl and the german tax authorities regarding payment of disputed taxes 
cost of sales in was lower than due to lower sales volume 
cost of sales in was lower than due to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and lower unit costs  primarily due to higher production levels  partially offset by higher sales volumes 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased in primarily due to the impact on net sales of increased average selling prices and decreased in primarily due to lower unit costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined in from the previous year due to lower distribution expenses related to lower sales volume and favorable effects of foreign currency translation  while expenses were lower than as a result of favorable effects of foreign currency translation and german trade capital tax refunds  partially offset by higher distribution expenses associated with higher sales volumes 
sales volume of  metric tons of tio in was lower than the record sales volume in reflecting lower sales volume in asia and latin america 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales  by volume  was attributable to markets in europe with approximately attributable to north america  approximately to asia and the balance to other regions 
industry wide demand was lower in the first half of  nl believes  due to customer destocking inventories 
kronos reduced its production rates to manage its inventory levels  and its average capacity utilization was approximately in demand improved in the second half of  and was strong throughout and the first half of  before moderating in the second half of nl expects industry demand in will be relatively unchanged from  but this will depend on global economic conditions 
kronos produced near full capacity in and  but is curtailing production in to a level not to exceed kronos expected sales volume 
nl s outlook for average tio selling prices in is uncertain 
notwithstanding the uncertain outlook for tio prices in  nl anticipates its operating income will be lower than due to lower production levels 
nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally germany  norway  belgium and canada 
the us dollar translated value of nl s foreign sales and operating costs is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period revenues and expenses 
a significant amount of nl s sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  principally major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
certain purchases of raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies decreased sales by million and million during and  respectively  compared to the year earlier period 
fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted nl s operating expenses and the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income comparisons was not significant in or securities earnings fluctuate in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
average funds invested in was higher than primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of rheox in january nl expects security earnings in will be lower than  due to lower average levels of funds available for investment due to the repayment of certain of nl s debt in corporate expenses  net in were lower than  primarily due to the million noncash charge taken in related to nl s adoption of sop  environmental remediation liabilities 
excluding this charge  corporate expenses  net were slightly lower than due to the recognition of million of income in related to the straight line  five year amortization of million of deferred income received in conjunction with the sale of rheox  partially offset by million of expenses in related to the unsuccessful acquisition of certain tio businesses and assets of tioxide 
corporate expenses  net in exceeded that of  primarily due to the aforementioned million noncash charge taken in interest expense in declined compared to principally due to prepayments of outstanding indebtedness  principally the senior secured discount notes  the joint venture term loan and a portion of kronos deutsche mark denominated debt 
interest expense declined in from due to lower levels of kronos dm denominated debt  partially offset by higher variable interest rates on such debt 
assuming no significant increase in interest rates  interest expense in is expected to be lower compared to due to lower levels of outstanding indebtedness  including required payments on the dm term loan 
nl s operations are conducted on a worldwide basis and the geographic mix of income can significantly impact nl s effective income tax rate 
in and  the geographic mix of income  including losses in certain jurisdictions for which no current refund was available and recognition of a deferred tax asset was not considered appropriate  contributed to nl s effective tax rate varying from a normally expected rate 
in  nl s effective tax rate varied from the normally expected rate due predominantly to the recognition of certain deductible tax attributes which previously did not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria and the one time effect of a refund of german withholding taxes 
liquidity and capital resources tremont the company had cash and equivalents of million at december   down from million at the end of and from million at the end of the decrease in cash during the past two years was primarily the result of cash used in the stock repurchase program during and and to purchase additional nl and timet common stock in the company s million increase in cash and cash equivalents during was primarily the result of the company s sale of timet common stock and timet s repayment of loans to the company from proceeds of timet s initial public stock offering

in february  the company borrowed an additional million from contran to partially fund the purchase of timet common stock from imi

the contran advance agreement is currently tremont s major source of liquidity 
absent additional purchases of nl  timet or tremont securities  the company does not currently believe it will need to borrow significant additional amounts from contran 
during  the company collateralized with cash certain letters of credit backing insurance policies at its captive insurance subsidiary 
in february  nl collateralized a portion of the letters of credit as they related to its business with the captive  and the company received million in cash previously pledged to collateralize the letters of credit  which funds were primarily used in the purchase of timet common stock from imi

any future dividends from nl and timet will be at the discretion of the respective company s board of directors and will depend upon  among other things  earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  cash availability and contractual requirements 
relative changes in assets and liabilities did not materially impact the company s cash flow from operating activities 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its alternative uses of capital  its debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital  and estimated future operating cash flows

in the normal course of business  the company may investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture and other business combination opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  the company may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or incurring indebtedness 
as previously reported  based upon the technical provisions of the investment company act of the act and tremont s ceasing to own a majority of timet s common stock following the imi titanium acquisition by timet in february  tremont might arguably be deemed to have become an investment company under the act  despite the fact that tremont does not now engage  nor has it engaged or intended to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading of securities 
tremont has taken the steps necessary to give itself the benefits of a temporary exemption under the act and has sought an order from the commission that tremont is primarily engaged  through timet and nl  in a non investment company business 
the company believes another exemption may be available to it under the act should the commission deny tremont s application for an exemptive order

in millions excluding changes in assets and liabilities changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  during the past three years generally follows the trend in operating results 
changes in assets and liabilities reflect the timing of purchases  production and sales  and can vary significantly from period to period 
accounts receivable increased used cash in and primarily because sales levels were increasing  and provided cash in as sales levels were decreasing 
timet currently expects net collections of receivables to be a source of cash in  particularly in the early part of the year due to both lower sales levels and improved collection efforts 
inventories increased in  reflecting the higher activity levels  and decreased in as a result of very high shipment levels in the fourth quarter of that year 
inventories increased significantly in  reflecting material purchases and build rates that were based on expected sales levels higher than the actual sales level turned out to be 
timet expects to significantly reduce inventories during as excess raw materials are consumed and other reduction control efforts are realized 
changes in net current income taxes payable increased in and and decreased in in part due to the delayed timing of cash payments for taxes in europe relative to earnings 
changes in accounts with related parties resulted primarily from payment of accrued interest in and relative changes in receivable levels with joint ventures in and investing activities 
timet s capital expenditures were million in  up from million in and million in about one half of capital expenditures during the two year period related to capacity expansion projects associated with long term customer agreements  which projects are also expected to improve cycle times and yields and to increase efficiency

based upon nl s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on nl s cash resources as discussed herein  nl expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its near term obligations including operations  capital expenditures and debt service 
to the extent that actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s liquidity could be adversely affected 
certain of nl s tax returns in various us and us jurisdictions are being examined and tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies  including non income tax related items and interest 
nl previously reached an agreement with the german tax authorities and paid certain tax deficiencies of approximately dm million million when paid  including interest  which resolved significant tax contingencies for years through in the third quarter of  nl received a dm million million when received refund of german dividend withholding taxes 
the german tax authorities were required to refund such amounts based on a german supreme court decision in favor of another taxpayer 
the refund resulted in a reduction of the settlement amount from dm million referred to above to dm million for years through no further withholding tax refunds are expected 
certain other significant german tax contingencies aggregating an estimated dm million million at december  through remain outstanding and are in litigation 
of these  one primary issue represents disputed amounts aggregating dm million million at december  for years through nl has received tax assessments for a substantial portion of these amounts 
no payments of tax or interest deficiencies related to these assessments are expected until the litigation is resolved 
during  a german tax court proceeding involving a tax issue substantially the same as this issue was decided in favor of the taxpayer 
the german tax authorities appealed that decision to the german supreme court which in february rendered its judgment in favor of the taxpayer 
nl believes that the german supreme court s judgment should determine the outcome of nl s primary dispute with the german tax authorities 
based on this recent favorable judgment  nl will request that the tax assessments be withdrawn 
nl has granted a dm million million at december  lien on its nordenham  germany tio plant in favor of the city of leverkusen related to this tax contingency  and a dm million million at december  lien in favor of the german federal tax authorities for other tax contingencies 
if the german tax authorities withdraw their assessments based on the german supreme court s decision  nl expects to request the release of the dm million lien in favor of the city of leverkusen 
in addition  during  nl reached an agreement with the german tax authorities regarding certain other issues not in litigation for the years through  and agreed to pay additional tax deficiencies of dm million million at december   most of which was paid in the third quarter of during  nl received a tax assessment from the norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  relating to nl has appealed this assessment and has begun litigation proceedings 
during nl was informed by the norwegian tax authorities that additional tax deficiencies of nok million million at december  will likely be proposed for the year nl intends to vigorously contest this issue and litigate  if necessary 
although nl believes that it will ultimately prevail  nl has granted a lien for the tax assessment on its norway tio plant in favor of the norwegian tax authorities and will be required to grant security on the assessment when received 
no assurance can be given that these tax matters will be resolved in nl s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court proceedings 
nl believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december   nl had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
nl operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to the us and germany  partially offsetting deferred tax assets which nl believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition to the chemicals business conducted through kronos  nl also has certain interests and associated liabilities relating to certain discontinued or divested businesses  and holdings of marketable equity securities including securities issued by valhi and other contran subsidiaries 
nl has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant 
nl believes it has adequate accruals for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs and the allocation of such costs among prps 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage arising out of the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and paint litigation is without merit 
nl has not accrued any amounts for such pending litigation 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
nl currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually or in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on nl s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
as discussed above  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore nl s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
the carrying value of nl s net investment in its german operations is a net liability due principally to its dm credit facility  while its net investment in its other non us operations are net assets 
as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  certain of nl s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business activities 
nl is in the process of evaluating and upgrading its computer systems both information technology systems and non it systems involving embedded chip technology and software applications collectively referred to as systems to ensure that the systems function properly beginning january  to achieve its yk compliance plan  nl is utilizing internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its systems 
nl has conducted an inventory of its it systems worldwide and is currently testing the systems and applications that have been corrected or reprogrammed for yk readiness 
nl has completed a preliminary inventory of its non it systems and is in the process of validating the inventory and correcting or replacing date deficient systems 
the remediation effort is well under way on all critical it and non it systems  and nl anticipates that remediation of such critical systems will be substantially complete by march  and that remediation and testing of all remaining systems will be complete by september once systems undergo remediation  they are tested for year readiness 
for critical systems  the testing process usually involves subjecting the remediated system to a simulated change of date from the year to the year using  in many cases  computer resources 
nl uses a number of packaged software products that have been upgraded to a yk ready version in the normal course of business 
excluding the cost of these software upgrades  nl s cost of becoming yk ready is expected to be approximately million  of which about half has been spent through december  nl has identified approximately major computer systems and assessed them for year readiness 
at december   approximately of the systems are year ready 
each operating unit has responsibility for its own conversion  in line with overall guidance and oversight provided by a corporate level coordinator  and the status of each of the remaining systems will be specifically tracked and monitored 
as part of its yk readiness plan  nl has requested confirmations from its major domestic and foreign software vendors  hardware vendors  primary suppliers and major customers  that they are developing and implementing plans to become  or are  yk ready 
confirmations received to date from nl s software vendors  hardware vendors  primary suppliers and major customers indicate that generally they are in the process of implementing remediation plans to ensure that their systems are ready by december  the major software vendors used by nl have already delivered yk ready software 
not withstanding these efforts  the ability of nl to affect yk readiness of such vendors  suppliers and customers is limited 
nl is developing a contingency plan to address potential yk related business interruptions that may occur on january   or thereafter 
this plan is expected to be completed in the second quarter of although nl expects its systems to be yk ready before december   it cannot predict the outcome or success of the yk readiness programs of its vendors  suppliers  and customers 
nl also cannot predict whether its major software vendors  who continue to test for yk readiness  will find additional problems that would result in unplanned upgrades of their applications after december  as a result of these uncertainties  nl cannot predict the impact on its financial condition or results of nonready yk systems that nl directly or indirectly relies upon 
should nl s yk readiness plan not be successful or be delayed beyond january  or should one or more vendors  suppliers or customers fail to adequately address their yk issues  the consequences to nl could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce tio at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include plant malfunction  impeded communications or power supplies  or slower transaction processing and financial reporting 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by nl or its key suppliers or customers to become yk ready would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of its facilities and a short term inability on the part of nl to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
beginning january   eleven of the fifteen members of the european union  including germany  belgium  the netherlands and france  adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
following the introduction of the euro  the participating countries national currencies remain legal tender as denominations of the euro from january  through january   and the exchange rates between the euro and such national currency units are fixed 
nl conducts substantial operations in europe 
the functional currency of nl s german  belgian  dutch and french operations will convert to the euro from their respective national currencies over a two year period beginning in the euro conversion may impact nl s operations including  among other things  changes in product pricing decisions necessitated by cross border price transparencies 
such changes in product pricing decisions could impact both selling prices and purchasing costs and  consequently  favorably or unfavorably impact results of operations 
nl has a significant amount of outstanding dm denominated indebtedness which  at nl s option  may be repaid in euros 
modifications of information systems to handle euro denominated transactions will be required  although the modifications are not expected to be extensive 
in nl assessed and evaluated the impact of the euro conversion on its business and made the necessary system conversions 
nl spent and charged to expense less than million in evaluation and conversion costs 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the effect of the euro conversion  nl cannot accurately predict the impact on its results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
nl periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  nl in the past has sought  and in the future may seek  to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  nl may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals industry 
in the event of any acquisition or joint venture transaction  nl may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing nl s existing debt

the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates  by contractual maturity dates  for nl s aggregate indebtedness 
at december  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars  and all outstanding variable rate indebtedness was denominated in deutsche marks 
information shown below for such dm denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using that date s exchange rate of dm per us dollar 
contractual maturity date fair value december total in millions fixed rate debt us dollar denominated principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt dm denominated principal 

amount weighted average interest rate currency exchange rates 
nl is exposed to market risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the deutsche mark  canadian dollar  belgian franc  french franc  norwegian krone and the united kingdom pound sterling 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to the conversion of certain of these currencies to the euro 
as described above  at december   nl had million of indebtedness denominated in deutsche marks 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates would be approximately million 
marketable equity security prices 
nl is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such equity securities at december  was million 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million

the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect nl s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for nl s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses nl would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by nl of future events or losses
