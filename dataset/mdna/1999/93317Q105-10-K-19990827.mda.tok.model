energy services sales and revenues increased million  or  over the prior year s eight month contribution see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating income of million exceeded the prior year by million

financial condition in fiscal  total debt decreased by million 
in june  an agreement was reached with financial security assurance  inc to release approximately million of funds held by trust ii  which were subject to retention at july  such funds were utilized to pay down trust iv indebtedness 
on december   mid state purchased from trust v instalment notes having a gross value of million and an economic balance of million 
mid state subsequently sold these notes to trust vii  a business trust organized by mid state 
these sales were in exchange for the net proceeds from the public issuance of million of asset backed notes by trust vii 
net proceeds from the public offering were primarily used to repay related asset backed borrowings of million under the trust v warehouse facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on may   mid state renewed its day  million loan and security agreement with kitty hawk funding corporation 
proceeds from the additional borrowings in million were utilized to pay down the revolving credit facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowings under the credit facilities totaled million at may  the revolving credit facility includes a sub facility for trade and other standby letters of credit in an amount up to million at any time outstanding and a sub facility for swingline advances in an amount not in excess of million at any time outstanding 
at may   letters of credit in the aggregate face amount of million have been issued and swingline advances were million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the credit facilities contain a number of significant covenants including maintaining specified financial ratios and complying with certain financial tests  including a fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
the borrowers fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of a ebitda minus capital expenditures to b the sum of all required principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  interest expense and dividends paid is required to be at least to at the end of each measurement period for the duration of the credit facilities 
the borrowers are required to maintain a leverage ratio the ratio of indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facilities of not more than to at the end of each measurement period for the duration of the credit facilities 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the trust v variable funding loan agreement s covenants  among other things  restrict the ability of trust v to dispose of assets  create liens and engage in mergers or consolidations 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at may  the loan and security agreement contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of mid state to dispose of assets  create liens on assets  engage in mergers  incur any unsecured or recourse debt  or make material changes to their credit and collection policy 
in addition  mid state is required to maintain specified net income and net worth levels 
the company was in compliance with these covenants at may  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  net of book overdrafts  were approximately million at may  operating cash flows for the year ended may   together with issuance of long term debt under trust vii and trust v variable funding loan agreement  borrowings under the credit facilities  the loan and security agreement and the use of available cash balances  were primarily used for retirement of long term senior debt  interest payments  capital expenditures and to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
in september  the company s board of directors authorized an increase  from two to four million  in the number of shares of the company s common stock which may be repurchased under its july stock repurchase program 
working capital is required to fund adequate levels of inventories and accounts receivable 
commitments for capital expenditures at may  were not significant  however  it is estimated that gross capital expenditures for the company s continuing operations for the fiscal year ending may  will approximate million 
because the company s operating cash flow is significantly influenced by the general economy and  in particular  levels of domestic construction activity  current results should not necessarily be used to predict the company s liquidity  capital expenditures  investment in instalment notes receivable or results of operations 
the company believes that the mid state trust v variable funding loan agreement will provide mid state with the funds needed to purchase the instalment notes and mortgages generated by jim walter homes and its affiliates 
it is anticipated that one or more permanent financings similar to the previous mid state asset backed financings will be required over the next several years to repay borrowings under the trust v variable funding loan agreement 
the company believes that  under present operating conditions  sufficient cash flow will be generated to make all required interest and principal payments on its indebtedness  to make all planned capital expenditures and meet substantially all operating needs 
it is further expected that amounts under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet peak operating needs of the company and to repurchase up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock  the amount remaining at may  under the current authorization 
market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks inherent in the company s financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its existing credit facilities  loan and security agreement  trust v variable funding loan  and any future financing requirements 
the company s primary market risk exposure relates to i the interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  ii the impact of interest rate movements on its ability to meet interest rate expense requirements and comply with financial covenants  and iii the impact of interest rate movements on the company s ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
the company has historically managed interest rate risk through the periodic use of interest rate hedging instruments 
there were no such instruments outstanding at may  while the company can not predict its ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on its existing debt  management continues to evaluate its financial position on an ongoing basis 
the company is also subject to a limited amount of foreign currency risk  but does not currently engage in any significant foreign currency hedging transactions to manage exposure for transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
year introduction the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year yk on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the yk problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the problems created by using abbreviated dates appear in hardware such as microchips  operating systems and other software programs 
the company s yk compliance project is intended to determine the readiness of the company s business for the year and to address the issues  if any  which were identified 
the company defines yk compliance to mean that the computer code will process all defined future dates properly and give accurate results 
description of areas of impact and risk the company has identified three areas where the yk issue creates risk to the company a internal information technology it systems  b non it systems with embedded chip technology and c system capabilities of third party businesses with relationships with the company  including product suppliers  customers  service providers such as telephone  power  logistics  financial services and other businesses whose failure to be yk compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
plan to address year compliance the company has established a corporate steering committee the committee to coordinate solutions to yk issues for its information systems  non it systems with embedded chips and third party business trading partners 
the committee includes a representative from each subsidiary as well as a member of the company s law department  the director of information technology and the chief financial officer 
each subsidiary also has a steering committee consisting of a representative on the committee and other members from all functional areas of the respective subsidiary 
the committee has identified systems and applications that require modification and has evaluated alternative solutions 
the committee also developed a yk standard that was issued to all subsidiaries and must be followed for yk compliance 
status conferences are held monthly and on site progress reviews are held quarterly 
the company has two data centers which have installed yk compliant mainframe equipment  operating systems and system software 
separate virtual machines within a computer have been installed for the purpose of testing 
during the first calendar quarter of  the company conducted a detailed review of all year remediation activities and associated required documentation to ensure that the process was on schedule 
state of readiness it systems the initial inventory and prioritization process for the company s it systems was completed in with the current focus on remediation and testing 
approximately of all identified it system business components have been tested and are considered compliant as of may  coding changes for all legacy systems have been completed and the final testing phase is in process 
the yk test environment is fully functional 
compliance testing will continue through and will be completed by november all financial systems have been remediated  tested and were considered fully compliant as of may  personal computer and other hardware compliant upgrades are complete  with the remainder on order 
non it systems non it systems consist of any device which is able to store and report date related information  such as access control systems  elevators  conveyors  and other items containing a microprocessor or internal clock 
the plan utilized by the company for analysis of the it systems was also used for non it systems 
all identified non it systems have been tested and are considered compliant as of may  material third parties the company has created an inventory of what it believes to be all material third parties with whom the company has a business relationship 
yk readiness surveys were sent to these third parties beginning in january the company has reviewed the responses to these surveys to determine the yk readiness of these third parties 
for those material third party suppliers  service providers and customers who fail to respond to the company s survey  the company is pursuing alternative means of obtaining yk readiness information  such as review of publicly available information published by such third parties 
the company plans to continue to review its third party relationships throughout the yk compliance program to ensure all material third party relationships are addressed 
contingency planning and risks contingency plan guidelines have been developed by the committee and provided to each subsidiary 
contingency plans are currently being prepared at all subsidiaries and are scheduled to be completed by october on site reviews of written contingency plans were conducted in the second calendar quarter of while the company believes that its approach to yk readiness is sound  it is possible that some business components may not be identified in the inventory  or that the scanning or testing process may not result in analysis and remediation of all source code 
the company will assume a third party is not yk ready if no yk verification is obtained and take action  as appropriate 
the company s contingency plan will address alternative providers and processes to deal with business interruptions that may be caused by the internal system or by the failure of third party providers to be yk ready to the extent possible 
in the unlikely event of a yk issue  the company s contingency plan focus is on employee safety  equipment safety and prompt business resumption 
the failure to correct a material yk issue could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failure could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
cost of project the overall budget for the company s yk compliance effort is approximately million 
the project is complete with the remaining related to contingency planning  final testing of remediated applications and post yk monitoring 
approximately million or of the project budget has been spent as of may  euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union commenced conversion from their existing sovereign currencies to a new  single currency called the euro 
fixed conversion rates between the existing currencies  the legacy currencies  and the euro will be established and the euro will become the common legal currency of the participating countries by january  the euro is trading on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the participants are issuing sovereign debt exclusively in euro and are redenominating outstanding sovereign debt 
following this introduction period  the participating members legacy currencies will remain legal tender as denominations of euro until january  at that time  countries will issue new euro denominated bills for use in cash transactions 
all legacy currency will be withdrawn prior to july   completing the euro conversion on this date 
as of january   the participating countries no longer control their own monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for the legacy currencies  instead  the authority to direct monetary policy  including money supply and official interest rates for the euro  is being exercised by the new european central bank 
the company has established a plan to address issues raised by the euro conversion 
these issues  which are applicable to the operations of aimcor include but are not limited to the competitive impact created by cross border price transparency  the need for the company and its business partners to adapt it and non it systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions  and the need to analyze the legal and contractual implications of the company s contracts 
the company currently anticipates that the required modifications to its systems  equipment and processes will be made on a timely basis and does not expect that the costs of such modifications will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
as part of phase i  the core it system has been modified for euro currency compliance 
the company s european locations are currently processing euro compliant transactions 
phase ii of the euro currency project focuses on the conversion effect to a euro base currency 
phase ii is scheduled to be complete by july  the project budget is approximately  of which approximately  has been spent
