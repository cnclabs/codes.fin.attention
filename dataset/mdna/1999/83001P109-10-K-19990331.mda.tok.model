revenue aggregated million in million at the eleven parks owned during the season  compared to million in  and to combined revenue of million in this increase in revenue at the same eleven parks is primarily attributable to increased attendance at these eleven parks  which resulted in part from increased season pass and group sales at several parks

the increase is a result of the full year s effect of the acquisitions other than riverside park  the purchase price paid for the riverside park and kentucky kingdom acquisitions and the on going capital program at the company s parks 
interest expense  net  increased million from as a result of interest on the company s senior notes due termination fee  net of expenses 
during october  the company entered into an agreement with the limited partner of the partnership that owns six flags over texas to become the managing general partner of the partnership  to manage the operations of the park  to receive a portion of the income from such operations  and to purchase limited partnership units over the term of the agreement 
the agreement was non exclusive and contained a termination fee of  payable to the company in the event the agreement was terminated

as more fully described in business six flags over georgia and six flags over texas and six flags hurricane harbor and in note to notes to consolidated financial statements  in connection with the six flags acquisition  the company guaranteed certain obligations relating to six flags over georgia and six flags over texas the co venture parks 
among such obligations are i minimum distributions of approximately million in to partners in the co venture parks of which the company will be entitled to receive million based on its present ownership interests  ii up to approximately million of limited partnership unit purchase obligations for with respect to both parks and iii minimum capital expenditures for that year at both parks of approximately million 
cash flows from operations at the co venture parks will be used to satisfy these requirements  before any funds are required from the company 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could adversely affect its liquidity 
the company s liquidity could also be adversely affected by unfavorable weather  accidents or the occurrence of an event or condition  including negative publicity or significant local competitive events  that significantly reduces paid attendance and  therefore  revenue at any of its theme parks 
on october   the company purchased the minority interest in six flags fiesta texas and title to the park for approximately million in cash

the company may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt on or prior to maturity or to seek additional financing 
market risks and sensitivity analyses like other global companies  premier is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of financial risk management at premier is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s earnings  cash flows and equity 
premier does not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
to manage market risks  on a limited basis premier has used derivative financial instruments  exclusively foreign exchange forward contracts 
these derivative financial instruments have been held to maturity and premier only uses non leveraged instruments 
these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
premier has used forward contracts to lock in the us dollar cost of equipment to be purchased from foreign vendors or manufacturers where the contracts related thereto are denominated in foreign currency 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of premier s accounting policies and use of such instruments 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of premier s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflect premier s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact premier s business as a result of these changes in interest and exchange rates 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis at december   premier had debt totaling  million  of which  million represents fixed rate debt and million represents floating rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value  earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  the pre tax earnings and cash flows impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately million 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis premier s exchange rate exposures result from its investments and ongoing operations in europe  specifically belgium  france and the netherlands  and certain other business transactions such as the purchase of rides from foreign vendors or manufacturers 
among other techniques  premier utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures 
at present  premier does not use financial instruments to hedge against currency risks associated with its walibi operations 
at december   premier had million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risks associated with million firm purchase commitments 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates ie  a weakening of the dollar against the applicable european currencies  the market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  would decrease by approximately million 
no amount of this decrease would impact earnings since the gain loss on these contracts would be offset by an equal loss gain on the underlying exposure being hedged 
assuming the walibi parks generate the same level of earnings and cash flow in as they did in  earnings and cash flows of the company in the event of such ten percent adverse change would decrease by less than  and million  respectively 
impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  it is expected that the company will adopt the provision of sfas no 
as of january  if the provisions of sfas no 
were to be applied as of december   it would not have a material effect on the company s financial position as of such date  or the results of operations for the year then ended 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop establishes standards for the financial report of start up costs and organization costs 
it requires that those costs be expensed as incurred 
the effect of the implementation of sop is accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
premier is required to adopt the provisions of sop in the first quarter of and does not anticipate that the adoption of the provision of sop will have a material effect on premier s financial position as of that date or the results of operations for the year then ended 
impact of year issue the company s year project the project is in process 
the project is addressing the year issue caused by computer programs being written utilizing two digits rather than four to define an applicable year 
as a result  the company s computer equipment  software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may misinterpret the actual date beginning on january  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
in planning and developing the project  the company has considered both its information technology it and its non it systems 
the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as it systems  including accounting  data processing  telephone systems  scanning equipment and other miscellaneous systems 
those items not to be considered as it technology include alarm systems  fax machines  monitors for park operations or other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain embedded technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company is in the process of replacing the computer equipment and upgrading the software it currently uses to become year compliant 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company plans to obtain replacements that are in compliance with year the company has initiated correspondence with its significant vendors and service providers to determine the extent such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether the products and services purchased from such entities are year compliant 
the company expects to receive a favorable response from such third parties and it is anticipated that their significant year issues will be addressed on a timely basis 
with regard to it  non it systems and communications with third parties  the company anticipates that the project will be completed in november as noted above  the company is in the process of replacing certain computer equipment and software because of the year issue 
the company estimates that the total cost of such replacements will be no more than million 
substantially all of the personnel being used on the project are existing company employees 
therefore  the labor costs of its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts  as well as currently anticipated labor costs to be incurred by the company with respect to year issues of third parties  are expected to be less than million 
the company has not yet developed a most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to year issues  but instead has focused its efforts on reducing uncertainties through the review described above 
the company has not developed year contingency plans other than as described above  and does not expect to do so unless merited by the results of its continuing review 
the company presently does not expect to incur significant operational problems due to the year issue 
however  if all year issues are not properly and timely identified  assessed  remediated and tested  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect its relationships with vendors or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material impact on the company s systems or results of operations
