item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we develop  manufacture  service and distribute an excimer laser unit and fiber optic delivery system for the treatment of certain coronary and vascular conditions 
our wholly owned subsidiary  polymicro technologies  inc  manufactures and distributes drawn silica glass products which include capillary tubing and specialty fiber optics sold to a variety of companies in addition to spectranetics 
our revenues are dependent on obtaining clinical data supporting regulatory approvals and market acceptance 
we sell the only excimer laser system that has been market approved by the fda in the united states for coronary applications 
our laser system competes primarily against alternative technologies including balloon catheters  cardiovascular stents and mechanical artherectomy devices 
our strategy is to develop additional procedures for our excimer laser system 
in  we secured fda approval to use our excimer laser system for removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads and entered into a supply and license agreement with united states surgical corporation for use of our system for tmlr  an experimental coronary procedure 
in  we sponsored clinical trials evaluating the use of our excimer laser system to treat restenosed stents  blocked arteries in the leg and totally blocked coronary arteries 
these trials will continue at least until the end of and may extend into the year depending on patient enrollment and our ability to fund these trials 
page to fund our strategy  we intend to continue to accelerate investment in the development of new products and in clinical trials for additional applications as well as sales and marketing resources 
this investment can be expected to result in operating losses through results of operations in this section we will discuss and revenue and net income results 
we will begin with a general overview  then discuss revenue and net income from our three operating units 
overview revenue per operating unit medical united states    medical europe    industrial polymicro technologies  inc    total    net income loss per operating unit medical united states    medical europe   industrial polymicro technologies  inc total    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in grew to  an increase of  or  over increased revenue includes a increase in disposable sales  a increase in revenues from polymicro  a increase in equipment revenue and a increase in service revenues 
increased disposable revenue  which consist of single use catheter products  came from our newest application lead removal  which was up over levels  and a increase in angioplasty catheters in the united states 
these gains were offset by a decline in disposable revenue from europe 
polymicro revenues were up as a result of sales of precision silica glass capillary tubing and assemblies into new capillary electropherisis applications such as dna sequencing and increased sales to existing gas chromatography customers 
equipment revenues increased in  primarily due to sales to united states surgical corporation in accordance with our supply agreement to provide lasers for their transmyocardial revascularization project 
during we completed delivery of all lasers ordered under this contract 
equipment revenues from united states surgical corporation totaled  in compared to  in the contract requires us to deliver an additional  in fiber optic disposables to support this program 
service revenues increased in due to the increasing installed base of the company s excimer laser systems 
gross margins in increased to from in this improvement was due to a combination of improved manufacturing efficiencies for both our medical and industrial groups  price increases on our catheter products and increases in sales of our catheter products  which generate higher margins than equipment  service or our industrial products 
page operating expenses grew in to  marketing and sales grew to  in of the  increase   relates to investments we are making in additional field personnel to allow us to increase customer support 
these additional employees have allowed us to introduce our lead extraction devices  which is a primary factor in growing our disposable revenue 
additional marketing costs of  related primarily to marketing materials and marketing agency fees associated with the launch of the lead removal products  combined with increased convention cost resulting for attending more conventions as compared to last year 
the remaining  increase relates to increased staffing and marketing activities at polymicro 
general and administrative expenses increased by to  research and development increased by to  research and development expenses reflect our efforts to improve our catheter designs and to develop additional applications for the excimer laser 
approximately of the increase is staffing  materials and outside consulting costs associated with the medical business 
the remaining increase relates to similar costs for our industrial group  polymicro 
other income is primarily interest income on cash and investments 
interest income is down due to lower cash balances and lower yields from short term investments 
other expense includes interest expense  which increased in due to interest charges on our loan from silicon valley bank 
net loss for has been reduced by to  from  in net loss decreased due to a reduction in loss from our united states medical unit and a increase in net income from our industrial group  polymicro technologies  inc these improvements were offset by an increase in net loss of from our european medical unit 
medical united states revenue from our medical business in the united states increased to  up from these increases were generated from sales of lead extraction devices  up  angioplasty catheters  up  service revenues  up  and sales of laser systems to united states surgical corporation  up 
net loss from this unit decreased from while revenues increased  operating expense growth increased 
most of the operating expense growth was in the area of marketing and sales 
medical europe revenue from our medical business in europe decreased from declines in our equipment and disposable product lines were and  respectively 
this was offset by a increase in service revenues 
sales in germany accounted for of the reduced revenues 
early in  we notified our german distributor that we were not going to renew our distribution agreement with them 
revenues from germany had already begun to fall  and without our commitment to continue our distribution agreement  sales through our distributor continued to decline 
in late  we initiated efforts to implement a direct sales effort in germany 
effective january   we are selling directly in germany in an effort to reestablish our presence in germany 
lead extraction catheters have had limited success in europe  providing only limited revenues 
with the establishment of direct selling capability  we will initiate a selling strategy for lead extraction devices that will be similar to the strategy we utilize in the united states 
net loss from european operations increased 
this increase in net loss is attributed to reduced sales from germany and a reduction in revenue from other parts of europe  along with a increase in operating expenses associated with establishing our own direct sales capability 
the functional currency of spectranetics international  bv is the dutch guilder 
all revenue and expense accounts are translated to united states dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighed average exchange rates during the year 
fluctuation in the dutch guilder currency rate during the year ended december  as compared to december  caused a decrease in revenues and operating expenses of less than of consolidated revenues and operating expenses  respectively 
page industrial polymicro technologies  inc polymicro revenues were up to  due to sales of precision silica glass capillary tubing and assemblies into new capillary electrophoresis applications such as dna sequencing and increased sales to existing gas chromatography customers 
operating expense for polymicro increased to  these increases reflect staffing increases in our engineering group to support customer needs and to develop additional configurations of our products 
we have also added sales personnel in an effort to broaden our customer base 
polymicro s net income increased to  this improvement was due to higher revenues and the efficiencies achieved from operations 
we recently announced that we are contemplating strategic alternatives for polymicro  which could include the sale of polymicro 
we anticipate that we would use any capital raised from such a transaction to accelerate developmental programs for our core medical business 
however  at this time we have not received an offer to purchase polymicro  nor have we made a firm decision to sell polymicro 
we have not set a fixed time frame for a decision 
we may decide not to sell polymicro or we may fail to obtain offers to purchase polymicro at a price we deem satisfactory 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in grew to  up  or over increased revenues include a increase in catheter sales  increase in revenues from polymicro and sales of laser systems to united states surgical corporation to support the development of the excimer laser for transmyocardial revascularization 
increased disposable revenue came from lead removal  our newest application  which was up over levels 
a decline in disposable revenue from europe offset these gains 
we sold our products to united states surgical corporation in accordance with our supply agreement to provide lasers and fiber optic probes for their transmyocardial revascularization project 
equipment revenues from united states surgical corporation totaled  in compared to  in gross margin was in compared to in operating expenses grew to  marketing and sales grew to  in this increase is attributable primarily to increased staffing costs of  combined with  of increased marketing activities associated with conventions  workshops and marketing materials 
general and administrative expenses increased by to  this increase was due primarily to increased staffing costs incurred as we built the infrastructure necessary to support investor relations  finance and administrative activities 
research and development increased by to  research and development expenses reflect incremental costs associated with the retrospective clinical study of the use of the excimer laser in restenosed stents and the european clinical study of the use of excimer lasers in crossing chronic total occlusions 
there were also increases in staffing to support the development of additional applications for the excimer laser 
other income is primarily interest income on cash and investments 
the decrease in other income of  is due primarily to a write off in of a liability accrued in connection with the merger with advanced interventional systems  inc no such adjustments were recorded in interest income decreased in compared to due to lower cash and securities balances 
net loss for increased by to  from  in net loss was impacted by a increase in loss from our united states medical unit  a increase in loss from our european medical unit and a reduction of polymicro technologies  inc net income 
page medical united states revenues from our medical business in the united states increased in this increase resulted from a increase in sales of lead extraction devices and sales of laser systems to united states surgical corporation 
net loss from this unit increased by from this growth is attributed to growth in sales and marketing expenses as well as general and administrative expenses as previously discussed 
medical europe revenues from our medical business in europe decreased from  primarily due to decreased unit volumes of disposable catheters 
net loss from european operations increased 
this increase in net loss is attributed to reduced sales from germany and a reduction in revenues from other parts of europe along with increased expenses in europe 
all revenue and expense accounts are translated to us dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighted average rates during the year 
fluctuations in the dutch guilder currency rate during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  caused a decrease in revenues and operating expenses equal to and respectively  of consolidated revenues and operating expenses 
industrial polymicro technologies  inc polymicro revenues were up in to  operating expense for polymicro increased in to  this increase reflects an increase in our engineering expenses to support customer needs and to develop variations to our products 
polymicro s net income decreased to  in this decline reflects our effort to increase the growth opportunities for polymicro 
income taxes at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  and expire at varying dates through the annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited under section of the internal revenue code of the company also has research and development tax credit carryforwards at december  for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which are available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any  and expire at varying dates through the annual use of portions of the research and development credit carryforwards is also limited under section liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at december  cash used in operations totaled  primarily due to the following  related to the net decrease in deferred revenue 
this relates primarily to amortization of deferred revenue recorded in associated with the agreement with united states surgical corporation whereby  was paid in advance in and amounts were amortized to revenue as products were shipped in   related to increased inventories  and  related to increased receivables balances 
these uses of cash were offset by cash provided by growth in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  related to increased operating expenses page and inventory levels in the table below describes the growth in receivables and inventory in relative terms  through the calculation of financial ratios 
days sales outstanding is calculated by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance by the average daily sales from the fourth quarter 
inventory turns is calculated by dividing annualized cost of sales for the fourth quarter by ending inventory 
days sales outstanding inventory turns receivables considered to be overdue were not material as of december  or cash used in investing activities was due to capital expenditures totaling  in compared to  in we upgraded computer systems and phone systems in at our headquarters and at polymicro  which accounted for approximately two thirds of the total capital expenditure 
the remainder relates primarily to manufacturing equipment purchased in net cash provided by financing activities was  consisting of  from the sales of common stock associated with stock option exercises and  from borrowings  offset by  from principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations 
the borrowing consisted of a  draw on our credit line collateralized by equipment and a  loan to spectranetics international bv secured by equipment held for rental or loan 
a  revolving credit line  which had not been drawn upon  expired in december we completed a private placement of common stock in february  which provided approximately  net of estimated expenses 
at december    and  we placed a number of systems on rental  loan and fee per procedure programs 
a total of   and  were recorded as equipment held for rental or loan for the years ended december    and  respectively  and are being depreciated over three to five years 
this equipment was transferred from inventory at cost 
we will continue to offer these programs as we execute our strategy of increasing our presence in major cardiac centers 
we currently use three placement programs rental programs straight rental program with terms varying from months to years 
rental revenues in the amount of  to  are invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
catheter revenues are recognized when shipped and invoiced 
the lasers are transferred from inventory to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment of the laser to the customer 
the laser is then depreciated over three to five years  depending on the type of laser 
depreciation on these lasers is included in cost of revenues 
at the end of the rental term  if the customer elects to purchase the unit  revenue is recognized upon invoicing the customer after receiving a valid purchase order 
cost of sales equal to the net book value of the system is also recorded at this time 
loan programs the company loans a laser system to an institution for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of the product and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of this laser 
the units are transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment of the laser system 
the laser systems are depreciated over a three to five year period and expensed to cost of revenues 
fee for procedure this program is similar to the rental program except that revenues are derived from a premium attached to the sale of each single use laser catheter 
revenue equal to the premium charged above list price for each catheter sold is recognized as rental revenues 
this rental income is immaterial to the financial statements  representing less than of consolidated page revenue 
all other accounting treatment is consistent with that noted above in the rental programs 
we recently announced that we are contemplating strategic alternatives for polymicro  which could include the sale of polymicro 
we anticipate that we would use any capital raised from such a transaction to accelerate developmental programs for our core medical business 
however  at this time we have not received an offer to purchase polymicro  nor have we made a firm decision to sell polymicro 
we have not set a fixed time frame for a decision 
we may decide not to sell polymicro or we may fail to obtain offers to purchase polymicro at a price we deem satisfactory 
we believe our liquidity and capitalization as of december   combined with the proceeds from the private placement of common stock completed in february  are sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through december  revenue increases from current levels will be necessary to sustain our business over the long term 
conversion to the euro on january   eleven countries in europe adopted a common currency  the euro  and exchange rates between the currencies of the eleven countries were fixed against the new euro 
the former currencies of those eleven countries will remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until january  and goods and services may be paid for using either the euro or the former currency until that time 
spectranetics international  bv  currently intends to continue using the dutch guilder as its functional currency until its fiscal year beginning january due to the size of the spectranetics international  bv operations in relation to the consolidated results  the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial results of operations 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  which is effective for fiscal quarters beginning after june  fas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies under the standard for hedge accounting 
the company does not anticipate a material impact on the results of operations as a result of implementing this standard 
year the year yk issue arose because many computer programs existing today utilize only two characters to recognize a year 
therefore  when the year arrives  these programs may not properly recognize a year beginning with instead of 
the yk issue may result in the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other microprocessor controlled equipment as the year is approached and reached 
state of readiness we have divided our yk exposure into three major areas o internal systems  o products  and o potential yk problems associated with outside vendors 
page because we believe that our primary yk issues could arise in the area of internal systems  we have focused on this area and have almost completed this phase of our yk project 
new computer systems  which are designed to be yk compliant  were installed and implemented during the first half of at our facilities in colorado springs  colorado and phoenix  arizona 
we are currently evaluating our computer systems at our european subsidiary  spectranetics international bv  for yk compliance 
these computer systems are the foundation for our business operations and include  but are not limited to  business functions such as order entry  shipping  purchasing  inventory control  manufacturing  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and general ledger 
we are also in the process of reviewing other equipment that contains date sensitive information 
we have implemented a yk compliant phone system at our headquarters and are reviewing other equipment for potential yk issues 
we expect to complete our review of internal systems by june  and do not expect a material adverse effect on our operations as a result of this review 
we have reviewed our products and determined that there are no date sensitive fields contained in any of the software within our products  therefore  we do not believe that our products will be affected by yk issues 
we are in the process of identifying any risks associated with the yk problem as it relates to outside vendors with systems that interface with our systems 
we expect to complete this review by june  based on a preliminary review of the yk impact associated with outside vendors  we do not expect this issue to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  since third party year compliance is not within our control  we cannot assure that yk issues affecting the systems of other companies on which our systems rely will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
costs to address the yk issue costs to address the yk issue include hardware  software  and implementation costs paid to outside consultants 
these costs totaled  in and were capitalized and will be depreciated over a three to five year period 
the costs were financed primarily through financing activities  which include capital leases and a draw on our line of credit 
depreciation costs for the twelve months ended december  and december  totaled  and  respectively 
interest costs associated with the capital leases used to finance hardware and software totaled  and  respectively  for twelve months ended december  and december  we do not expect to incur material future costs associated with the yk issue as it relates to internal systems 
other expenses  which include non capitalized equipment and consulting costs  were  and  respectively  for the twelve months ended december  and december  risks presented by the year issue to date  we have not identified any yk issues that we believe could materially adversely affect us or for which a suitable solution cannot be implemented 
however  as the review of our internal systems and interfaces with outside vendors progresses  it is possible that yk issues may be identified that could result in a material adverse effect on our operations 
for more information  see risk factors year issues could hurt our business 
contingency plans although we have not prepared a formal contingency plan to date  we intend to continue to assess our yk risks and develop contingency plans as appropriate 
risk factors we have continued to suffer losses 
we have incurred net losses since our inception in june at december   we had accumulated million in net losses since inception 
we anticipate that our net losses will continue in the foreseeable future 
we may be unable to increase sales or achieve profitability 
limited cash on hand  additional financing may be needed and we may not be able to obtain it 
we believe that our existing cash  cash from operations and the proceeds from our private placement to the selling stockholders should be sufficient to support our plans through at least the next months 
however  we may need to page raise additional cash prior to that time 
we may be unable to obtain additional financing  if needed  on satisfactory terms or at all 
if financing is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to make capital expenditures  compete effectively or withstand the effects of adverse market and economic conditions 
cash flow from operating activities may not be sufficient to sustain our long term operations unless we are able to increase sales and control expenses 
if we finance future operations through additional issuances of equity securities  you may suffer dilution and the price of the common stock may fall 
our small sales and marketing team may be unable to compete with our larger competitors or reach all potential customers 
many of our competitors have larger sales and marketing operations than ours 
this allows those competitors to spend more time with customers  which gives them a significant advantage over our team in making sales 
our european operations have not been successful and our recently established direct sales force in europe may not be successful 
in january  we established a direct sales force for our principal european markets 
we may be unable to develop an effective european sales force  and our sales and marketing efforts in europe could be unsuccessful 
we are exposed to the problems that come from having international operations 
for the year ended december   our revenues from international operations represented of consolidated revenues 
of these revenues  were derived from sales in germany 
changes in overseas economic conditions  currency exchange rates  foreign tax laws or tariffs or other trade regulations could adversely affect our ability to market our products in these and other countries 
as we expand our international operations  we expect our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies to expand 
our products are still new and may not be accepted in their markets 
excimer laser technology is a relatively new procedure that competes with more established therapies for restoring circulation to clogged or obstructed arteries 
market acceptance of the excimer laser system depends on our ability to provide adequate clinical and economic data that shows the clinical efficacy of and patient need for excimer laser angioplasty and lead removal 
we may be unable to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry in which many other competitors are bigger companies 
our primary competitors are manufacturers of products used in competing therapies  such as o balloon angioplasty  which uses a balloon to push obstructions out of the way  o stent implantation  o open chest bypass surgery  and o atherectomy  a mechanical method for removing arterial blockages 
we also compete with companies that develop lead extraction devices or removal methods  such as mechanical sheaths 
almost all of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
we expect competition to intensify 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the interventional cardiovascular market are o the ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively  o the impact of managed care practices and procedure costs  o ease of use  o size and effectiveness of sales forces  and o research and development capabilities 
scimed life systems  inc a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  cordis corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson interventional systems  advanced cardiovascular systems  inc a subsidiary of guidant corporation  bard and schneider a subsidiary of pfizer inc are the leading balloon angioplasty page manufacturers 
scimed  cordis  advanced cardiovascular systems and medtronic  inc are the leading stent providers in the united states 
manufacturers of atherectomy devices include devices for vascular intervention  inc a subsidiary of guidant corporation and heart technology  inc a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation 
failure of third parties to reimburse medical providers for our products may reduce our sales 
we sell our cvx laser unit primarily to hospitals  which then bill third party payors such as government programs and private insurance plans  for the services the hospitals provide using the cvx laser unit 
unlike balloon angioplasty and atherectomy  laser angioplasty requires the purchase of expensive capital equipment 
in some circumstances  the amount reimbursed to hospitals for procedures involving our products may not be adequate to cover a hospital s costs 
we do not believe that reimbursement has materially adversely affected our business to date  but continued cost containment measures could hurt our business in the future 
in addition  the fda has required that the label for the cvx laser unit state that adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed together with laser angioplasty in most of the procedures we submitted to the fda for pre market approval 
adjunctive balloon angioplasty requires the purchase of a balloon catheter in addition to the laser catheter 
while all approved procedures using the excimer laser system are reimbursable  some third party payors attempt to deny reimbursement for procedures they believe are duplicative  such as adjunctive balloon angioplasty performed together with laser angioplasty 
third party payors may also attempt to deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was experimental  was used for a non approved indication or was not used in accordance with established pay protocols regarding cost effective treatment methods 
hospitals that have experienced reimbursement problems or expect to experience reimbursement problems may not purchase our excimer laser systems in the future 
regulatory compliance is very expensive and can often be denied or significantly delayed 
the industry in which we compete is subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable state and foreign agencies 
complying with these regulations is costly and time consuming 
international regulatory approval processes may take longer than the fda approval process 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to  among other things  fines  suspensions of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
we may be unable to obtain future regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted 
for example  the fda approval process for the use of excimer laser technology in clearing blocked arteries in the lower leg has taken longer than we anticipated  due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements 
failures in clinical trials may hurt our business and our stock price 
all of spectranetics potential products are subject to extensive regulation and will require approval from the food and drug administration and other regulatory agencies prior to commercial sale 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large clinical trials 
companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in various stages of clinical trials  even in advanced clinical trials after promising results had been obtained in earlier trials 
the development of safe and effective products is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
the product development process may take several years  depending on the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product 
product candidates that may appear to be promising in development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may o be found ineffective  o take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  or o require additional clinical data and testing 
in particular  our prima r laser guidewire  which allows excimer laser energy to assist in crossing totally blocked arteries  has not been as effective as we expected 
also  during the course of review of the prima guidewire by the fda  alternative technologies have surfaced which may limit market acceptance of the prima guidewire 
we cannot guarantee that the clinical trials relating to any of our products will be successful 
page we have important sole source suppliers and may be unable to replace them if they stop supplying us 
we purchase certain components of our cvx laser unit from several sole source suppliers 
we do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers and order products through purchase orders placed with these suppliers from time to time 
while we believe that we could obtain replacement components from alternative suppliers  we may be unable to do so 
potential product liability claims and insufficient insurance coverage may hurt our business and stock price 
we are subject to risk of product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance with coverage and aggregate maximum amounts of million 
the coverage limits of our insurance policies may be inadequate  and insurance coverage with acceptable terms could be unavailable in the future 
technological change may result in our products being obsolete 
we derive approximately two thirds of our revenues from the sale or lease of the cvx laser unit and the sale of disposable devices 
technological progress or new developments in our industry could adversely affect sales of our products 
many companies  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do  are engaged in research and development for the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease 
these include pharmaceutical approaches as well as development of new or improved angioplasty  atherectomy or other devices 
our products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations in the treatment of vascular disease 
our patents and proprietary rights may be proved invalid so competitors can copy our products  we may infringe other companies rights 
we hold patents and licenses to use patented technology  and have patent applications pending 
any patents for which we have applied may not be granted 
in addition  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to give us any competitive advantage 
our patents could be challenged as invalid or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we do not have patents in many foreign countries 
we could be adversely affected if any of our licensors terminate our licenses to use patented technology 
we are aware of patents and patent applications owned by others relating to laser and fiber optic technologies  which  if determined to be valid and enforceable  may be infringed by spectranetics 
holders of certain patents  including holders of patents involving the use of lasers in the body  have contacted us and requested that we enter into license agreements for the underlying technology 
we cannot guarantee you that a patent holder will not file a lawsuit against us and may prevail 
if we decide that we need to license this technology  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all 
we may not be able to develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is time consuming  expensive  unpredictable and could divert the efforts of our management 
an adverse ruling could subject us to significant liability  require us to seek licenses and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
protections against unsolicited takeovers in our rights plan  charter and bylaws may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to resell their shares at a premium over market price 
we have a stockholder rights plan that may prevent an unsolicited change of control of spectranetics 
the rights plan may adversely affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
under the rights plan  rights to purchase preferred stock in certain circumstances have been issued to holders of outstanding shares of common stock  and rights will be issued in the future for any newly issued common stock 
holders of the preferred stock are entitled to certain dividend  voting and liquidation rights that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire spectranetics 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions relating to issuance of preferred stock  special meetings of stockholders and amendments of the bylaws that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an unsolicited change in the control of spectranetics 
our board of directors are elected for staggered three year terms  which prevents stockholders from electing all directors at each annual meeting and may have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
page potential volatility of stock price 
the market price of our common stock  similar to other health care companies  has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock o fluctuations in operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new products by spectranetics or our competitors  o governmental regulation  o developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  o public concern regarding the safety of products developed by spectranetics or others  o general market conditions  and o financing future operations through additional issuances of equity securities  which may result in dilution to existing stockholders and falling stock prices 
year issues could hurt our business 
we installed and implemented new computer systems at our colorado and arizona facilities in the first half of although our new software is designed to be year compliant  we cannot assure that this software contains all necessary data code changes 
we are currently evaluating our other computer systems for year compliance 
although we expect all of our critical systems to be year compliant by june   there is a risk that some or all of our systems will not be year compliant by upon review of our product offerings  we have determined that the software within our products does not contain date sensitive fields 
as a result  we do not believe that our products will be affected by year issues 
we cannot assure  however  that all of our products are year compliant 
we are in the process of obtaining information from outside vendors regarding systems that interface with our systems 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that year issues relating to these systems will adversely affect our business 
however  since third party year compliance is not within our control  we cannot assure that any year issues affecting our outside vendors will not adversely affect our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary market risks include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments to any degree to manage these risks 
the company does not use financial instruments to manage changes in commodity prices and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
our debt consists of obligations with a fixed interest rate ranging from to as well as an obligation with a variable interest rate equal to the prime rate plus 
an increase or decrease in the prime rate of would cause interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately  over a twelve month period
