quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates due to its international sales  production and funding requirements 
it is the company s policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce market risk where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
foreign currency and interest rate transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet the company s objectives and the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from sales  purchases and other costs from the adverse impact of exchange rate movements 
foreign exchange risk is managed by using forward exchange contracts and purchased options to hedge certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
purchased currency options are used to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions expected to be recognized within one year 
cross currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in european currencies  japanese yen and canadian dollar 
the market risk related to these contracts was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements at december  year compliance the company has made extensive efforts over the past several years to upgrade or replace all enterprise level software and hardware platforms 
a part of the selection criteria for new software and hardware systems were global software support and year compliance 
the company is replacing its current management information system with an enterprise system that integrates electronic data interchange edi and inventory management capabilities 
this system  most aspects of which are already operational  coupled with a state of the art warehouse inventory management system  will be fully operational in the second quarter of and will address the year issue on all core company business systems 
these include  but are not limited to  financial  manufacturing and inventory management  distribution  and sales order processing applications 
the company has other ancillary systems such as sales reporting  product development  retail  merchandising and design that are scheduled to be modified as required to address year issues in a timely fashion 
desktop productivity systems  networking and communications are also integral to the company s operations and have been surveyed for year compliance 
non compliant components and software have been identified and are scheduled for replacement or upgrade where necessary by mid non information technology systems such as company owned manufacturing equipment  office equipment and local office telephone systems are being assessed for related year risks 
the company conducts business with several customers via edi and will implement and test year compliant standards and software to help ensure uninterrupted service 
the majority of the company s product sourcing is performed through independent manufacturers primarily in southeast asia 
although analyses are underway  an initial review of these facilities indicates that most operations and business processes are manual in nature and  consequently  the company does not expect the year issue will impact its ability to effectively source its products 
the company s enterprise management information systems were implemented primarily to improve its business processes rather than solely to address year compliance issues 
the costs associated with bringing the company s ancillary  desktop productivity  networking  communication and non information technology systems into year compliance have been assessed and estimated that expenditures for the project will be approximately  for the year ended december   with costs being paid out of working capital 
this estimate  based on currently available information  will be updated as the company continues its assessment and proceeds with implementation and testing  and may require further revision 
the company has undergone what it believes is a reasonable and thorough review of year issues on its operations  liquidity and financial condition and identified the related issues and risks 
as a result of this review  the company believes no identified issues or reasonably foreseeable circumstances should have a material affect on the company 
the most reasonable likely issue facing the company regarding year compliance is the inability of compliant software or systems to perform as intended 
although the company does not have a comprehensive contingency plan  it expects to apply its own resources and the resources of system providers to solve these issues as they are identified 
the company will continue to take appropriate measures to assure that its operating systems are prepared for year related issues 
it should be understood that the company is reliant on many external parties and their related systems which could affect the company s ability to meet possible eventualities 
such external entities include  but are not limited to  certain united states and foreign governmental agencies  material suppliers  and product manufacturers as well as service providers such as freight forwarders  transportation  and utilities companies 
in addition  the company as well as these external entities are expecting that the software and hardware put into place will perform all functions as expected
