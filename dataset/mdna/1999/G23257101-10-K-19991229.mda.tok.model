these risks include competing in a saturated industry against modern and larger fleets  the ability of the company to obtain additional financing for the acquisition of additional ships  a high percentage of debt on assets owned by the company  the potential for additional governmental regulations  the need for expensive upgrades and or maintenance to aging vessels  general economic factors in markets where the company operates  and other factors discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission

as the majority owner of sea comm  the company includes all of sea comm s revenues and expenses in its consolidated financial statements and makes an appropriate entry to account for the minority interest of its partner 
because the semester at sea program is operated by seawise pursuant to a charter  the income and losses of the semester at sea program are substantially realized by seawise  not sea comm

as the majority owner of albuferra  the company includes all of albuferra s revenues and expenses in its consolidated financial statements and makes an appropriate entry to account for the minority interest of its partner 
with respect to capri cruises  the company earns income from the profit or loss of the capri cruises venture as a whole 
because the company owns exactly half of capri cruises  it accounts for its interest in capri cruises using the equity method and does not consolidate the revenues and expenses of the venture in its consolidated financial statements 
instead  such financial statements are prepared independently and the company includes an appropriate line item for its equity in the net income or loss from this unconsolidated joint venture in its financial statements

the company s slowest months are january  september and october 
results of operations year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues decreased by  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the universe explorer being out of service for days during the year ended september  for the installation of a sprinkler system as well as a lucrative eight day charter of the enchanted isle during the fiscal year ended september  the company s operating expenses decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was the savings related to the universe explorer being out of service for days during the year ended september  for the installation of a sprinkler system 
due to rising fuel costs at the end of fiscal  the company expects an increase in fuel cost in fiscal marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher expenses were primarily due to expenses incurred in adding personnel and systems to accommodate the company s expansion from three ships in fiscal to five ships in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the additional capital expenditures incurred by the company in conjunction with installing the sprinkler system on the universe explorer  which increase was largely offset by the extension of the original depreciable life on that vessel  from years to years 
the effect of this change in accounting estimate on the fiscal statement of earnings was  which results in a decrease of 
per share basic and 
per share diluted 
interest expense  net  decreased by  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to increased interest income associated with the company s higher cash balances in versus the minority interests in the company s consolidated joint ventures sea comm and albuferra are reflected in the   and  line item for minority interest in loss of consolidated joint ventures for fiscal  and  respectively 
sea comm posted a profit of  in fiscal as compared to a loss of  during fiscal the return to profitability was primarily due to the discontinuation of the wec caribbean program  which was unprofitable in fiscal  and the continued high load factors in fiscal for the alaska program 
in september  approximately  of expenses attributable to albuferra were allocated on a one time basis  to the joint venture  resulting in an increase in minority interest in loss of consolidated joint ventures of approximately  the minority interests each account for approximately of their respective profits or losses 
the company accounts for the capri cruises joint venture under the equity method 
the company s investment in capri cruises resulted in a net loss of  for fiscal as compared to a loss of  for the period ended september  these fiscal losses were due to costs related to the start up operation  including losses related to the late delivery of the vessel and other expenses for which capri cruises was not contractually responsible 
capri cruises became profitable during the third quarter of fiscal and remained profitable during the fourth quarter 
the company expects such profitability to continue as capri cruises successfully defined its market in fiscal the company s preferred stock dividend increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the dividend in fiscal relates to the company s series b stock  which was issued in february the dividend in fiscal relates to the company s series a preference shares which were all converted into common stock during fiscal year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues increased by  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher passenger yields and an eight day charter  on the company s new orleans itinerary 
revenues also increased during fiscal due to the increase in load factors for the alaska program which increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal the increased loads yielded higher revenues 
the company s operating expenses decreased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses represented of revenues in fiscal  as compared to of revenue in fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of the increase in revenues  as a majority of the company s operating expenses are fixed costs 
marketing  selling and administrative expenses increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher expenses were primarily due to increased salary and related expenses 
additionally  the company operated more wec alaska and caribbean cruises during fiscal than in fiscal  which required additional advertising and promotional expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the additional capital expenditures incurred by the company in conjunction with meeting its solas requirements on its two owned vessels 
interest expense  net  decreased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal due to lower outstanding principal amounts on the company s loans 
seawise s interest in the company s sea comm joint venture is reflected in the  and  line item for minority interest share of loss of consolidated joint venture for fiscal and  respectively 
sea comm lost  during fiscal as compared to  during fiscal the decline in such loss was primarily due to the increase in load factors for the alaska program  which increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately in fiscal the increased loads yielded higher revenues and a better net result 
seawise  through its minority interest  absorbs approximately of the company s loss on the sea comm joint venture 
the company accounts for the capri cruises joint venture under the equity method 
the company s investment in capri cruises resulted in a net loss of  for the period ended september  these losses were due to costs related to the start up operation  including losses related to the late delivery of the vessel and other expenses for which capri cruises was not contractually responsible 
the company expects capri cruises to become profitable in the future  however  capri cruises is expected to continue to incur losses  on a declining basis  in the near future as it defines its market 
such losses  if significant  could have a material impact on the company s operations 
the provision for preferred stock dividend decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal as a result of the conversion of all of the company s series a preference shares into common stock during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  at september  as compared to a working capital deficiency of  at september  the improvement in the company s working capital position was primarily due to the private sale of  of series b stock  the refinancing of the loan on the universe explorer  as well as a change in the company s fmc arrangement 
during fiscal  the company arranged for a surety bond to guarantee the enchanted isle s fmc requirements thereby freeing the  long term deposit that had been securing the company s fmc certificate 
cash flows from operations provided   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash flows for fiscal consisted primarily of decreases in restricted cash due to the company s revised fmc arrangement and increases in accounts payable due to payments owed for the construction in progress on the enchanted sun  which were partially offset by increases in trade and other receivables related to a cancelled cruise charter and a reimbursement on the company s liability insurance premiums which was paid subsequent to year end 
the company s cash flow used in investing activities in fiscal exceeded the fiscal outlay by  the primary reason was the increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of the enchanted sun  the installation of the sprinkler system on the universe explorer  and the improvements to the company s existing fleet 
this increase was partially offset by the investment made by viejas in albuferra in september and the release of the deposit securing the company s fmc certificate 
the company s cash flow provided by financing activities during fiscal was  compared to cash flow used in financing activities of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
this change was primarily due to approximately  in net proceeds from the key loan used for the partial repayment of the effjohn loan and for the universe explorer sprinkler system   in proceeds from the nationsbank loan for the installation of the sprinkler system aboard the universe explorer  and approximately  in proceeds from the nordbanken loan for the purchase and renovation of the enchanted sun 
at september   the company owed a total of  pursuant to the effjohn loan  key loan  nationsbank loan and nordbanken loan  which loans bear interest at   and  respectively 
the effjohn loan  key loan and nordbanken loan are secured by mortgages on the company s vessels  and the nationsbank loan is secured by a letter of credit provided by seawise 
the key loan and the effjohn loan also require the company to meet certain financial covenants 
in february  the company closed on a  private offering of its series b stock 
the series b stock accrues dividends at the rate of per annum and are convertible into the company s common stock at the rate of per share beginning months from the date of issuance 
the net proceeds to the company were  after deducting brokers commissions and expenses of the offering 
the company expects to fund the cash needs for its capri cruises operation from cash from its established operations 
capri cruises earned a profit in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company s plans to expend approximately  for capital improvements to the enchanted sun and the crown dynasty during the first half of fiscal the company will finance approximately  of that amount with the remaining proceeds of the nordbanken loan   of that amount through the issuance of  shares of common stock to the general contractor and its subcontractors for the renovations  and the balance from the company s operating funds 
during fiscal  the company anticipates that it may require additional capital for acquisitions of additional vessels or new business opportunities 
the company has reached an agreement to purchase the crown dynasty for  subject to its approval of final documentation 
the company currently anticipates that the purchase price will be funded through a combination of seller provided and third party loans and approximately  to  from the proceeds of an equity financing by the company 
the company has not reached an agreement with respect to any other proposed ventures 
in the event the company proceeds with any additional business opportunities  it anticipates that the capital requirements will be funded from cash from operations or from financings arranged in connection therewith 
in  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop establishes standards for accounting for internal use software projects 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  for costs incurred in those fiscal years for all projects  including projects in progress when the sop was adopted 
management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop provides guidance on accounting for start up costs and organization costs  which must be expensed as incurred 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  as a result of this statement  the company will incur a charge of approximately  as of october   which on a pro forma basis would have decreased the fiscal earnings per share basic by 
and the earnings per share diluted by 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or a miscalculation  causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
due to the expansion of the company s business  the company purchased a new as for its reservations system in fiscal  along with the operating systems  that were the latest versions available 
the company also installed new workstations for most of its non reservations staff 
additionally  the company installed a new general ledger and accounts payable system in may the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has evaluated its on board point of sale computer equipment and reservations computer software and made the changes and upgrades necessary  based on the opinion of the consultants and vendors it has hired for such purpose  to assure that such equipment will function properly in the year the company believes that it has identified all year problems with respect to its own computer equipment and software 
all of the company s systems functioned properly on september   a date that was commonly used by computer programmers as a default date for an expiration or termination date in many older programs and systems 
the company also contacted its significant vendors  customers and service providers  including its technical manager  to determine the extent to which such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether the products and services purchased from or by such entities are year compliant 
the company has incurred an immaterial amount in costs associated with the identification and remediation of its year issues as it has reprogrammed its reservations system using in house personnel 
the cost of the as system  internal network of workstations and the accounts payable general ledger system was approximately    and  respectively 
the company believes that both it and its significant vendors and service providers are year compliant 
however  the difference in the interpretations of compliant with year may lead to different levels of compliance by the company  its vendors and service providers 
as a result  the company has developed a contingency plan for its business and each of its vessels that identifies and sets forth how it will handle its most reasonably likely worst case scenario in the event of any system failures 
this plan assesses the impact of system failures on the company s operations and provides for back up and alternative procedures to be followed if a failure should occur 
the company has identified the following areas as those that could be affected by such failures i passenger air transportation to the cruise ships points of embarkation especially aruba  to which virtually all of the company s passengers rely on air transportation  ii shipboard systems  iii shipboard revenue points  iv third party supplied items  and v reservations 
the plan provides for the company to i establish a central operations center at the company s principal offices during the year rollover  ii assign key internal personnel to be on call during the year rollover  iii provide for key external suppliers  such as the company s technical manager  to be on call during the year rollover  iv operate the company s shipboard systems  shipboard revenue points and reservations systems manually  if necessary  v use various airlines and flights to carry passengers to the company s cities of embarkation to ensure that the maximum number of passengers are able to reach such cities in the event of cancellation of some flights  and vi stockpile food  fuel and other consumable essentials  to the extent the company is able to do so  prior to the year rollover 
as part of the company s plan  the company has completed united states coast guard mandated drills on board its vessels with its shipboard personnel and company training sessions with its shoreside reservations personnel to simulate the conditions that may occur during the rollover 
if the company ultimately relies upon a portion of its contingency plan because either the company or its vendors and service providers have failed to identify and remediate all of their respective year issues  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or its relationships with its customers  vendors and service providers  or that a partial lack of compliance will not lead to claims against the company  the magnitude of which are not currently estimable 
no assurance can be given that such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant to date 
there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate instruments  with respect to both its liquid assets and its debt instruments 
the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate declines 
an immediate decline of in interest rates would reduce the company s annual interest income by  the key loan is a variable rate loan  however  the company has purchased interest rate protection for such loan in the form of an interest rate swap 
as a result  although the key loan bears interest at the prime rate plus basis points  the interest rate swap provides that the rate shall effectively be fixed at over the term of the loan 
the nationsbank loan is also a variable rate loan  however  the company has also purchased interest rate protection for such loan in the form of an interest rate swap 
as a result  although the nationsbank loan bears interest at libor plus basis points  the interest rate swap provides that the rate shall effectively be fixed at over the term of the loan 
the effjohn loan bears interest at libor plus  and thus is affected by changes in interest rates 
in the event that interest rates increased by  the company s interest obligation would increase by   and  respectively  in each of its fiscal years  and
