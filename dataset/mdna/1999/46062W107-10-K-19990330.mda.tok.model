item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition description of business interpore international  inc interpore cross designs  manufactures and markets synthetic bone and tissue products and spinal implant devices 
our merger with cross medical products  inc cross in may has significantly increased our focus on the spine market  one of the fastest growing areas within the orthopaedic marketplace 
we report our sales in two product categories bone biologics and spinal products 
bone biologics are comprised of pro osteon r bone graft substitute products and oem hydroxyapatite products 
these products are derived from coral and serve as a lattice for new bone growth when implanted into a bone defect 
the unique  interconnected porous architecture of the product is a key to its success as a bone graft substitute 
bone graft substitutes such as pro osteon offer distinct advantages over autografts and allografts 
in an autograft  bone is taken from another part of the patient s body  and frequently creates pain  longer recovery  and risk of other complications for the patient 
an allograft  or bone taken from a cadaver  carries the risk of implant rejection or disease transmission 
we recently introduced our new agf tm autologous growth factors tm related products  which can be used with a bone graft material  such as pro osteon  to encourage bone growth 
agf is comprised of concentrated growth factors derived from platelets in the patient s own blood during the surgical procedure 
in the spine products category  we offer the synergy tm spinal system  which is used to facilitate spine fusions in patients suffering from degenerative conditions and deformities of the spine 
these conditions frequently cause severe pain and loss of muscle function in patients 
the synergy system is comprised of titanium or stainless steel hooks  rods and screws and the instruments required for the surgeon to assemble a construct which restores the natural anatomy  keeping it immobilized while a bone graft eventually fuses the vertebrae naturally 
prior to the merger  we distributed our bone biologics products through employee direct sales representatives and commissioned independent agents in the us  and through stocking distributors outside the us in the us we had been converting to direct representatives because we believed  with only bone graft products in our product portfolio  we could get more focused sales time compared to independent agents carrying other product lines 
cross was distributing its products in the us solely through independent agents  and internationally through stocking distributors 
in the us  both companies sales forces were calling directly on the same decision maker the orthopaedic spine surgeon  providing part of the rationale for the merger 
once the merger was completed  the respective companies product portfolios were combined  and as a result we found we could attract independent agents that desired our complementary product portfolio and that possessed strong surgeon relationships  an important factor for competing in this industry 
therefore  we expect to increase our use of independent agents for the domestic distribution of both bone biologics and spine products 
currently  the surgeon is the key decision maker with respect to the purchase of our products  and the hospital pays our invoices directly 
however  for many other medical device products  the purchasing decision has been assumed by hospital purchasing departments  buying groups or managed care organizations 
also  for some other medical device products  insurance companies and medicare have refused to reimburse the hospital  or the company directly in the case of direct to insurer billing by the company  and therefore reimbursement becomes an issue 
these factors have not been an issue for us to date 
however  in the future there can be no assurance that the decision making responsibility will not shift from the surgeon  or that reimbursement will not become an issue affecting our revenues 
other factors potentially affecting continued revenue growth include the pricing practices of our competitors  competitive new product introductions  and our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified direct sales representatives  independent agents  and distributors 
sales to our oem customers and our international distributors are affected by their purchasing practices  and in the case of international sales  by the financial capacity of our distributors and the economic conditions in their countries 
continued revenue growth may also depend upon our ability to successfully introduce new products or product improvements 
see certain business considerations in our annual report on form k 
significant events in february  we entered into an agreement to merge with cross  a publicly traded ohio based worldwide supplier of spinal implant systems used to treat degenerative conditions and deformities of the spine 
the shareholders of both companies approved the merger on may  and it became effective on may  we exchanged approximately million shares of our common stock for all of the common stock of cross 
we accounted for the merger as a pooling of interests 
in april  we entered into an agreement to sell our dental business to steri oss inc of yorba linda  california 
in may  the sale was completed  and we received an initial cash payment of million 
in march  we received a deferred cash payment of  as part of the transaction  interpore cross and steri oss negotiated a distribution agreement under which we manufacture and provide interpore r porous hydroxyapatite bone void filler for distribution by steri oss in the dental market 
in the quarter ended june   we recorded a net charge of  as a result of the transaction  including associated costs 
in march  cross entered into an agreement to sell its recovery products segment for million in cash and the assumption of million of debt and other liabilities 
the buyer also acquired  shares of cross common stock for  results of operations the following table presents our results of operations as percentages percentage of net sales percentage change vs

oem sales  which are dependent upon the ordering patterns of two customers  decreased by  in versus sales of spinal implant products increased in the year ended december  by million or to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects continued market penetration of this relatively new system  aided by the improved distribution and greater domestic territory coverage following the merger

additionally  domestic sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than international sales  comprised a greater percentage of total sales in than in total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million or to million compared to total operating expenses of million during the same period of the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to million of merger related expenses  restructuring charges and non recurring charges incurred in excluding these charges and the loss on the sale of the dental business  total operating expenses remained relatively level between the two periods

sales of bone biologics products increased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable primarily to a increase in domestic pro osteon product sales and a increase in international pro osteon product sales 
sales of spinal implant products increased in the year ended december  by million or to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of increased penetration into the spinal implant market as cross continued to increase its distribution network and the number of surgeons using the synergy spinal system 
also  in january  the posterior portion of the titanium version of the synergy spinal system received fda marketing clearance for sale in the united states 
sales of dental products declined by million or from million in to million in  reflecting the discontinuance of dental product sales effective april total domestic sales of bone biologics and spinal products increased or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period of international sales increased by million or to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period of for the year ended december   the gross margin improved to of sales from of sales for the twelve months ended december  the improvement reflects the discontinuance of dental product sales which had lower gross margins than our bone biologics and spinal implant products 
this was partially offset by the inventory valuation adjustment of  that was recognized for products that became obsolete or slow moving due to the widespread acceptance of certain improvements and modifications to the synergy spinal system 
total operating expenses for the year ended december   which included a  loss on the sale of the dental business  increased by  as compared to the same period of research and development expenses increased by or  as a result of increased spinal product development efforts 
selling and marketing expenses decreased or million compared to the twelve months ended december  due to the elimination of selling and marketing expenses directly related to the dental business partially offset by increased commissions on higher domestic sales 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  primarily the result of product liability insurance premiums on increased sales  partially offset by cost reductions following the sale of the dental business 
the  or increase in net interest and other income resulted from increased interest income on higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of the dental and recovery products businesses in the income tax benefit in of million reflects recognition of million of deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating loss carryforwards  which had previously been fully reserved in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million at the end of the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million was primarily the result of the payment of million in merger related expenses  restructuring charges and non recurring charges  the repurchase of million of our common stock  and the redemption of million of convertible debentures  all during accordingly  total working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  and the current ratio decreased to from we had million of cash and cash equivalents available at december  to support the continued investment in the development of our business  including the development or acquisition of new bone biologic and spinal implant products  and possible acquisitions of businesses 
we have a million revolving line of credit which had no amount outstanding at december  and which expires in july we intend to negotiate an extension of the line of credit prior to its expiration  but there can be no assurance that an extension will be obtained 
at december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe we currently possess sufficient resources to meet the cash requirements of our operations for at least the next year 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by not recognizing to mean the year we use only third party software  and in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   we reported on our initial assessment of this software 
state of readiness in our initial assessment  we contacted the authors of our critical software programs and determined that each was either already year compliant or expected to be year compliant by december  we have identified our remaining software as well as hardware  vendors and customers collectively elements and are currently in the process of determining those which we consider to be mission critical 
for elements determined to be mission critical  we will seek to obtain assurances of year compliance 
the assurances sought will be in the form of vendor or customer certifications  identification of alternatives  company administered testing efforts  or a combination of certain assurances 
we have no way of ensuring that mission critical vendors or customers will be year compliant  and their inability to become compliant on a timely basis could materially impact our operations or financial condition 
costs to address our year issues through december   we have not incurred any direct costs associated with year issues 
certain costs associated with the consolidation of operations following our merger with cross resulted in obtaining software hardware that is year compliant 
while the process of evaluating elements is not complete  at this time  we do not believe that we will need to replace any material non compliant systems or hire any year solution providers 
therefore  at this time  we estimate that future costs to address year issues should not be material 
risks of our year issues we have yet to identify any mission critical element that we expect to not be year compliant 
in the continuing process of evaluating elements  we will have to rely on third party certifications of year compliance 
in the event that mission critical elements fail to be compliant  we could experience a material disruption in operations  including  but not limited to interruption in supply of parts from vendors  inability to deliver products to customers or to produce products on schedule  or failure of financial systems  all of which could materially affect our business and cause a loss of customers 
contingency plans we have not established a contingency plan relative to year issues 
as our assessment continues  if it is determined that any mission critical elements are likely not to be year compliant  we will develop a contingency plan
