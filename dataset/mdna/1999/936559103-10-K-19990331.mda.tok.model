item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general warwick community bancorp  inc the company is a bank holding company incorporated in september under the laws of the state of delaware and is registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
the company was organized at the direction of the warwick savings bank the bank for the purpose of acquiring all of the common stock of the bank issued in connection with the conversion of the bank from mutual to stock form conversion 
on december   the bank completed its conversion  and the company sold  shares of its common stock at a price of per share in a subscription offering offering to certain depositors of the bank 
in connection with the conversion and offering  the company established the warwick savings foundation foundation and made a charitable contribution of  shares of the company s common stock to the foundation  which resulted in a one time charge relating to the funding of the foundation of million million net of tax 
the net proceeds from the offering amounted to million  and the company contributed of the net proceeds from the offering to the bank in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the bank 
the remaining net proceeds were retained by the company and invested primarily in federal funds  government and federal agency mortgage backed securities  other debt securities and equity securities 
prior to the offering  the company had no significant assets  liabilities or operations 
presently  the only significant assets of the company are the capital stock of the bank  the note evidencing the loan the company made to the warwick community bancorp  inc employee stock ownership plan esop to allow the esop to purchase of the company s common stock issued in the offering and the investment of the net proceeds of the offering retained by the company 
the primary business of the company is the operation of its wholly owned subsidiary  the bank 
the bank s principal business has been and continues to be attracting retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding its four branches and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in one to four family residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  commercial business and real estate loans and various debt and equity securities 
the bank s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
the bank also generates other income  such as service charges and other fees  which are primarily servicing fees received from residential mortgage loans that are sold with servicing retained 
other expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expenses  federal deposit insurance premiums  net costs of real estate owned  data processing fees and other operating expenses 
the bank s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
while the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations includes the collective results of the company and the bank  this discussion reflects primarily the bank s activities 
unless otherwise disclosed  the information presented in this annual report reflects the financial condition and results of operations of the company and the bank on a consolidated basis 
management strategy the bank has historically employed an operating strategy that emphasizes the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans in its market area with both fixed and variable rates and  to an increasing degree over the past years  its commercial lending business  with mostly prime rate based loans secured by real estate located mainly in orange county  new york 
due in part to this strategy  the bank historically has had profitable operations  resulting in a strong regulatory capital position 
the bank s goal of maintaining this position has led to an overall strategy of managed growth in both deposits and assets 
the major elements of the company s operating strategy are to i grow and diversify the bank s loan portfolio by continuing to originate owner occupied residential mortgage loans  commercial business and commercial real estate loans  construction loans and consumer loans in its market area  ii complement the bank s mortgage lending activities by investing in mortgage backed and other securities  iii maintain the bank s relatively low cost of funds and iv manage the bank s level of interest rate risk 
from time to time  the bank employs a leveraging strategy  whereby borrowings are used to fund specific investments in order to provide for a reasonable net margin of return 
the bank also seeks to attract and retain customers through extended office hours  low turnover of employees and prompt  flexible and personalized production of a variety of loan products 
in addition  it is a goal of the bank to increase its market share in the communities it serves through the acquisition or establishment of branch offices and  if appropriate  the acquisition of smaller financial institutions 
additionally  it is a goal of the bank to expand into new markets 
for this reason  the bank has expanded its mortgage banking operations and lending into new jersey  and the company is in the process of forming a de novo commercial bank to be headquartered in bergen county  new jersey 
management of interest rate risk the principal objectives of the bank s interest rate risk management activities are to i evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  ii determine the level of risk appropriate given the bank s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  iii establish prudent asset concentration guidelines and iv manage the risk consistent with board approved policies and guidelines 
through such management  the bank seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operating results to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or repricing dates 
the bank closely monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the bank 
historically  the bank has been a traditional thrift lender  but differentiated itself from other thrifts by also focusing on commercial lending since the late s and commission based mortgage banking operations since the bank also adopted a more competitive pricing policy  more efficient lock in policies to close loans faster and more streamlined federal national mortgage association fnma approved processing and underwriting procedures 
additionally  the bank s array of products has expanded to include federal housing authority fha  veterans administration va and state of new york mortgage association sonyma loans 
as a result  the bank has invested a relatively large amount of its earning assets in fixed rate loans and fixed rate mortgage backed securities with contractual maturities of up to years 
at december   an aggregate of million  or of total earning assets  were invested in such assets 
based upon the assumptions used in the following table  at december   the company s total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded its total interest earning assets maturing or repricing in the same time period by million  representing a one year cumulative gap  as defined below  as a percentage of total assets of negative 
accordingly  management views the company as having a manageable gap position  but still slightly vulnerable to a rising interest rate environment 
the bank has taken several actions  under various market conditions  designed to manage its level of interest rate risk 
these actions have included i increasing the percentage of the loan portfolio consisting of adjustable rate mortgage loans and prime rate based commercial loans through originations  as market conditions permit  ii selling fixed rate loans  but retaining the servicing rights  iii purchasing shorter term investment securities and iv seeking to increase the percentage of checking accounts in its deposit base 
additionally  in the normal course of business  the bank uses off balance sheet financial instruments primarily as part of mortgage banking hedging strategies 
such instruments generally include put options purchased and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  these financial instruments will develop unrealized gains or losses that mitigate changes in the underlying hedged portion of the balance sheet 
when effectively used  these instruments are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates move up or down 
gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets or liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the bank  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined based on the earlier of term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be reinvested and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated early payoffs of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
for loans on one to four family residential properties and mortgage backed securities  assumed average annual prepayment rates of and  respectively  were utilized

for purposes of the gap analysis  second mortgage loans are included in the other loans category 
for purposes of the gap analysis  unearned fees and deferred loan origination costs are prorated 
for purposes of the gap analysis  based upon the bank s historical experience  management traditionally slots of the bank s total savings account balances into the twelve month time horizon 
the remaining are viewed as long term deposits 
for loans on residential properties an average annual prepayment rate of is utilized 
mortgage backed securities are assumed to prepay at an average annual rate of 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate change scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
for purposes of the npv table  prepayment speeds similar to those used in the gap table were used  reinvestment rates were those in effect for similar products being offered and rates on core deposits were modified to reflect recent trends 
the following table sets forth the company s npv as of december   as calculated by the company 
net portfolio value portfolio value of assets dollars in thousands rate in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change static  based upon the portfolio value of the company s assets assuming no change in interest rates 
as in the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in actual market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv model presented assumes that the composition of the company s interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
average balance sheets 
the table on the following page sets forth certain information relating to the company for the seven months ended december  and for the years ended may  and the yields and costs were derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances were computed based on month end balances 
yields for the seven months ended december  are annualized 
management believes the use of average monthly balances instead of average daily balances does not have a material effect on the information presented 
the yields include deferred fees and discounts which are considered yield adjustments

interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin on interest bearing assets represents net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets 
rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

management and the board of directors perform a monthly review of delinquent loans 
the actions taken by the bank with respect to the delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency 
the bank s policies on residential mortgage loans provide that delinquent mortgage loans be reviewed and that a late charge notice be mailed no later than the th day of delinquency  with the delinquency charge assessed on the th day 
the bank s collection policies on residential mortgage loans essentially mirror those shown in the fnma servicing agreements 
on other loans  telephone contact and various delinquency notices at different intervals are the methods used to collect past due loans 
it is the bank s general policy to discontinue accruing interest on all loans when management has determined that the borrower will be unable to meet contractual obligations or when interest or principal payments are days past due 
when a loan is classified as non accrual  the recognition of interest income ceases 
interest previously accrued and remaining unpaid is reversed against income 
cash payments received are applied to principal  and interest income is not recognized unless management determines that the financial condition and payment record of the borrower warrant the recognition of income 
if a foreclosure action is commenced and the loan is not brought current  paid in full or an acceptable workout arrangement is not agreed upon before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan is generally sold at foreclosure 
property acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure on a mortgage loan is classified as real estate owned and is recorded at the lower of the unpaid balance or fair value less costs to sell at the date of acquisition and thereafter 
upon foreclosure  it is the bank s policy to generally require an appraisal of the property and  thereafter  appraise the property on an as needed basis 
other real estate owned 
at december   the bank s other real estate owned oreo  net  which consisted of four single family residential properties  totaled thousand and was held directly by the bank

this increase in total assets was primarily the result of increases in the company s interest earning assets  as the company grew both its loan and investment securities portfolios 
the asset growth was also funded through borrowings  which increased million to million at december  at december   the company had million in securities sold under repurchase agreements and million in term loans from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny 
deposit liabilities increased by million to at december  from million at december   primarily due to increases in demand checking accounts  money market accounts and now accounts 
asset growth was concentrated in mortgage loans  net which increased million to million at december  from million at december  other loans  net  showed an increase of million to million at december  from million at december  total securities were million at december  compared to million at december  securities held to maturity at december  totaled million as compared to million at december  securities available for sale at december  totaled million as compared to million at december  this increase is primarily the result of the bank s utilization of additional wholesale leveraging transactions in order to enhance earnings 
bank premises and equipment  net  increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily the result of the costs associated with the opening of the company s newly constructed full service branch facility located in the town of wallkill  and from the upgrading and replacement of much of the company s electronic data processing hardware and software in connection with the company s year compliance plan 
the fhlbny stock portfolio increased by million in conjunction with both the company s larger asset size and the utilization of wholesale leveraging transactions 
total stockholders equity decreased million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the million in open market purchases of the company s common stock in conjunction with the establishment of the recognition and retention plan of the company rrp 
also contributing to this decrease was the payment of the company s cash dividend to shareholders of thousand 
the decrease in total stockholders equity was partially offset by net income of million for the seven months ended december  comparison of operating results for the seven months ended december  and general 
net income for the seven months ended december  totaled million  or per share  as compared to a net loss of thousand for the comparable period in the seven months ended december  included a one time after tax charge of million for the establishment of the foundation in connection with the bank s conversion in december excluding the one time charge for the foundation  net income for the seven months ended december  would have been million 
earnings per share results are not available for the seven months ended december  since the company did not complete its offering until december  net interest income 
net interest income for the seven months ended december  increased million  or  to million  from million for the seven months ended december  net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of total average earnings assets 
for the seven months ended december  the net interest margin was as compared to for the seven months ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the basis point decrease in the average yield earned on interest earnings assets coupled with the basis point increase in the average rate paid on money market accounts  as compared to the seven months ended december  excluding money market accounts  the rates paid on other interest bearing liabilities decreased  which resulted in a net increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points as compared to the period 
this reflects the continuation of the lower interest rate environment during average interest earning assets increased million from million for the seven months ended december  to million for the seven months ended december   while average interest bearing liabilities increased million from million to million for the same period 
supplementing the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  funding for the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily provided by a million increase in average equity  which included the infusion of capital derived from the offering  from million for the seven months ended december   to million for the comparable period ended december  interest income 
for the seven months ended december   interest income totaled million as compared to million for the seven months ended december  the million  or  increase was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in the amount of interest earned on the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  which resulted primarily from an increase in the average balance of the company s mortgage loans from million for the seven months ended december  to million for the seven months ended december  as home purchasers and existing homeowners capitalized on the opportunities afforded by lower mortgage loan interest rates 
the increase in interest income was also attributable  to a lesser extent  to growth in the bank s commercial and consumer loan portfolios 
interest earned on other loans during the seven months ended december  increased by thousand  compared to the seven months ended december  the growth experienced resulted from strong loan demand as discussed above 
interest earned on mortgage backed and investment securities increased by million over the same period  and resulted largely from the bank s utilization of additional wholesale leveraging transactions in order to enhance earnings 
total interest income was further bolstered by increases in interest and dividends earned on securities  which were derived mainly from such wholesale leveraging transactions 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased to for the seven months ended december   as compared to for the seven months ended december  this was primarily due to the lower yields earned on the bank s loan and investment securities portfolios due to lower long term interest rates during the seven months ended december  interest expense 
interest expense for the seven months ended december  was million  compared to million for the seven months ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase of million in the average balance of borrowed funds  a basis point increase in the average rate paid on money market accounts  and a million increase in the average balance of money market accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of certificate accounts and by a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on borrowed funds 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to increases in the interest paid on borrowings associated with the aforementioned wholesale leveraging transactions  which increased by million 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the seven months ended december  decreased to thousand  as compared to thousand for the seven months ended december  this decrease resulted from management s assessment of the growth in the loan portfolio  the level of the bank s allowance for possible loan losses and its assessment of the local economy and market conditions

at december   the allowance for possible loan losses totaled million  and the ratio of such allowance to non performing loans was 
other income 
other income  consisting of service and fee income and gains and losses on securities and loan transactions  increased by thousand  or  to million for the seven months ended december   as compared to million for the seven months ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of thousand in sales of securities  an increase of thousand in service and fee income due to the growth in checking account deposits during and an increase of thousand in loan sales  partially offset by a thousand reduction in other income associated with write offs of leasehold improvements and equipment that resulted from the closing of the company s full service leased branch and the simultaneous opening of the company s new full service branch in the town of wallkill 
other expense 
other expense increased by thousand to million for the seven months ended december   as compared to million for the seven months ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and benefits of million attributable to additions to staff necessary to attract and service a growing number of loan account and deposit account customers 
professional fees increased thousand primarily as a result of ongoing consultation and audit activities in connection with the company s new legal structure following the offering and the bank s conversion 
advertising expense increased thousand in order to support the company s branch relocation and grand opening  and to promote the bank s name in the highly competitive mortgage loan and commercial loan arenas

the provision for income taxes increased from thousand for the seven months ended december  to million for the seven months ended december  this increase was attributable to the increase in pre tax income 
comparison of financial condition at may  and may  total assets increased million to million at may   from million at may   reflecting the company s ongoing strategy of managed growth 
this increase in total assets was primarily the result of increases in the company s interest earning assets  as the company grew both its loan and investment securities portfolios 
the asset growth was also funded through borrowings  which increased million to million at may   and from the million in net proceeds raised by the company in the offering 
at may   the company had million in securities sold under repurchase agreements and million in term loans from the fhlbny 
deposit liabilities increased by million to million at may  from million at may   primarily due to increases in demand checking accounts  now accounts and money market accounts  offset by the decline in time certificates

supplementing the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  funding for the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily provided by a million increase in average retained earnings  which included the infusion of capital derived from the offering  from million for the fiscal year ended may   to million for the comparable period ended may  net interest income for the fiscal year ended may  increased million  or  to million  from million for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in interest income resulted primarily from the significant growth of the mortgage loan portfolio  as home purchasers and existing homeowners capitalized on the opportunities afforded by lower mortgage loan interest rates 
concurrently  the more modest increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in interest on borrowed funds  coupled with a decrease in time deposit interest expense 
interest income 
for the fiscal year ended may  interest income totaled million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended may  the million  or  increase in was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in the amount of interest earned on the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  which resulted primarily from an increase in the average balance of the company s mortgage loans from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may  interest earned on other loans and on federal funds sold during the fiscal year ended may  increased by thousand and thousand  respectively  compared to the fiscal year ended may  those increases  however  were largely offset by a thousand decrease in interest earned on mortgage backed and investment securities over the same period 
the increase in the average yield on interest earning assets to for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to for the fiscal year ended may   resulted in part from the sale of relatively lower yielding securities  and the purchase of higher yielding securities with portions of the proceeds from such sales  in connection with the company s restructuring of its investment securities portfolio during the summer of however  the improvement in yield derived from investments was partially offset by lower yields earned on the bank s loan portfolios due to lower long term interest rates at the start of interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended may  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended may   due primarily to an increase of million in the average balance of borrowed funds  a basis point increase in the average rate paid on escrow deposits and a thousand increase in the average balance of escrow deposits in connection with the increase in the company s mortgage loans and additional wholesale leverage transactions entered into during the fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of total interest bearing deposits and by a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on borrowed funds 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the fiscal year ended may  increased to thousand  as compared to thousand for the fiscal year ended may  this increase resulted from management s assessment of the growth in the loan portfolio  the level of the bank s allowance for possible loan losses and its assessment of the local economy and market conditions 
for the fiscal years ended may  and  loan charge offs  net of recoveries  aggregated thousand and thousand  respectively 
at may  and  the allowance for possible loan losses totaled million and million  respectively  and the ratio of such allowance to non performing loans was at may   as compared to at may  other income 
other income  consisting of service and fee income and gains and losses on securities and loan transactions  increased by thousand  or  to million for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended may  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of thousand in service and fee income due to the growth in checking account deposits during and an increase of thousand in other income associated with increased loan and loan servicing activity  which was partially offset by a thousand reduction on sales of securities and a thousand reduction on loan sales 
other expense 
other expense increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to million for the fiscal year ended may  this increase resulted primarily from an expense of million relating to the company s contribution to the foundation and an expense of thousand relating to the first year s allocation of shares under the esop which was established in connection with the conversion and the offering 
salaries and employee benefits expense also increased thousand  or  due to higher levels of expenses incurred in connection with the employee benefit plans established in connection with the conversion and the offering and normal salary increases 
professional fees increased thousand primarily as a result of various consultation and audit activities in connection with the conversion and the offering 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased thousand from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may  this decrease was primarily attributable to the tax benefit derived from the company s contribution to the foundation 
comparison of financial condition at may  and may  total assets increased million to million at may   from million at may   reflecting the company s ongoing strategy of managed growth 
the asset growth was funded primarily through borrowings  which increased million to million at may  as of may   the company had million in securities sold under repurchase agreements and million in term loans from the fhlbny 
deposit liabilities declined by million to million at may  form million at may   primarily due to continued decreases in rollovers of a february offering of a nine month certificate of deposit account premium certificates  initially priced slightly above local market rates to provide the bank with additional liquidity at the time of the failure of nationar  one of the bank s correspondent banks

comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended may  and general 
net income for the fiscal year ended may  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended may  the increase of million resulted primarily from an increase in the company s net interest margin and greater profits on sales of mortgage backed securities 
also contributing to the increase in net income was a decline in the company s provision for income taxes due to a change in tax regulations from an effective tax rate of in fiscal to in fiscal net interest income 
net interest income for the fiscal year ended may  increased million  or to million 
this increase reflects the overall rise in the company s average interest rate spread of basis points to  and a rise in the company s net interest margin of basis points to for the fiscal year  as well as a greater increase in interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities 
market interest rates were slightly higher in the fiscal year across the entire us treasury yield curve than in the fiscal year

interest income 
interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended may   compared to million for the fiscal year ended may  this increase of million  or  reflects an increase of more than million in interest and dividends on securities due to the securitization of approximately million of the company s mortgages in april and may of  offset  in part  by a decrease in the average yield on the company s mortgage backed securities of basis points 
the increase in interest was offset  in part  by a decline of over thousand in interest income on mortgage and other loans due to the decreased volume of such loans resulting mainly from such securitization  mitigated somewhat by an increase of basis points in the average yield on such loans 
interest income on federal funds sold decreased substantially in the fiscal year ended may   as compared to the prior years  due to management s focus on extending maturities slightly  in its efforts to increase yield in a flattening yield curve environment 
interest expense 
interest expense on deposits and borrowings increased thousand to million for the fiscal year ended may   compared to million for the fiscal year ended may  this increase reflects an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million during the fiscal year and a decrease in the average rate paid on such liabilities of five base points over the same period 
the increase in average interest bearing liabilities is primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to million for the fiscal year from thousand for the fiscal year 
average certificate of deposit accounts declined by approximately million in fiscal year  partially due to the maturity of the premium certificates which was attributable to the company s decision not to offer premium rates in a highly competitive rate environment 
while there was a decline in average certificate of deposit accounts  there was a decline in interest expense associated with such accounts  from million in the fiscal year ended may  to million in the fiscal year 
as a result  the company s total cost of funds decreased by five base points  from to  despite the increases in market interest rates in fiscal year provision for loan losses

moreover  management believes that most of these loans are adequately secured by properties affording low loan to value ratios  based upon current evaluations 
in addition  management performs a quarterly in depth analysis of its allowance for loan losses 
based upon loan types and volumes  loan review and classification systems  and the factors described above and various other factors  management has made regular determinations that its allowance and monthly provisions are adequate 
other income 
other income  net  for the fiscal year ended may  increased thousand to million from million for the fiscal year ended may  this increase was primarily attributable to increased gains on sales of mortgage backed securities  emanating form the company s mortgage banking operation

the company s ratio of other expenses to average assets decreased to in the fiscal year from in the fiscal year 
provisions for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased thousand from million for the fiscal year ended may  to for the fiscal year ended may  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase of million  or  in pre tax income  offset by savings due to a change in the bank s effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funds are retail deposits  wholesale funding from fhlbny or other bank borrowings  securities sold under repurchase agreements  principal and interest payments on loans and securities and  to a lesser extent  proceeds from the sale of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities provide an indication of the timing of the receipt of funds  changes in interest rates  economic conditions and competition strongly influence mortgage prepayment rates and deposit flows  reducing the predictability of the timing of sources of funds 
the bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios or balances to maintain  however  it does adhere to a liquidity and funds management policy approved by its board of directors  which sets minimum internal guidelines for liquidity purposes 
as a member of the fhlbny  the bank has the availability of two lines of credit for borrowings in the amounts of million each  one on an overnight basis and the other on a day term basis 
in accordance with the fhlbny s credit policy  the bank now has total credit facilities available of nearly million  inclusive of the aforementioned amounts  before the delivery of qualifying collateral is required 
additionally  the bank has other sources of liquidity if the need arises

the company believes it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current originations and other lending commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled million 
based on historical experience and pricing strategy  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
at december   the company had cash and due from banks of million and securities available for sale of million 
management believes these amounts  together with the company s borrowing capabilities  to be more than adequate to meet its short term cash needs 
regulatory capital position the bank is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal deposit insurance corporation which vary according to an institution s capital level and the composition of its assets 
an insured institution is required to maintain tier i capital of not less than of total assets plus an additional amount of at least to basis points leverage capital ratio 
an insured institution must also maintain a ratio of total capital to risk based assets of at least 
although the minimum leverage capital ratio is  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia stipulates that an institution with less than a leverage capital ratio is deemed to be an undercapitalized institution  which results in the imposition of regulatory restrictions 
the bank s capital ratios qualify it to be deemed well capitalized under fdicia 
in addition  the company s capital ratios exceed the minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve board  which are substantially similar to the requirements of the fdic 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for the bank s and the company s regulatory capital position as of december  and may  year compliance the year issue is the result of the inability of certain computer systems to recognize the year many existing computer programs and systems were initially programmed with six digit dates that provided only two digits to identify the calendar year in the date field without considering the upcoming change in the century 
as a result  such programs and systems may recognize a date using as the year instead of the year  which could result in system failures or miscalculations 
like most financial service providers  the company and its operations may be significantly affected by the year issue due to the nature of financial information 
software  hardware and equipment both within and outside the company s direct control and with whom the company electronically or operationally interfaces ie  third party vendors providing data processing  information system management  maintenance of computer systems and credit bureau information are likely to be affected 
furthermore  if computer systems are not adequately changed to identify the year  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
as a result  many calculations which rely upon the date field information  such as interest  payment or due dates and other operating functions  may generate results which could be significantly misstated  and the company could experience a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition  under certain circumstances  failure to adequately address the year issue could adversely affect the viability of the company s suppliers and creditors and the creditworthiness of its borrowers 
thus  if not adequately addressed  the year issue could result in a material adverse impact upon the company s products  services and competitive condition and  therefore  its results of operations  and could be deemed to imperil the safety and soundness of the bank 
the fdic  the bank s primary federal regulator  along with the other federal bank regulatory agencies  has published substantive guidance on the year issue and has included year compliance as a substantive area of examination 
these publications  in addition to providing guidance as to examination criteria  have outlined requirements for the creation and implementation of a compliance plan and target dates for testing and implementation of corrective actions 
as a result of the oversight by and authority vested in the federal bank regulatory agencies  a financial institution that does not become year compliant could be subject to administrative remedies similar to those imposed on financial institutions otherwise found not to be operating in a safe and sound manner  including remedies available under prompt corrective action regulations 
the company has developed and is implementing a plan the plan to address the year issue and its effects on the company 
the plan includes five components which address issues involving awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the company has completed the awareness  assessment and renovation phases of the plan 
during the awareness and assessment phases of the plan  the company inventoried all material information systems and those of third party vendors 
the company is now actively involved in the validation and implementation phases of the plan 
under regulatory guidelines issued by the federal banking regulators  the bank and the company are required to substantially complete testing of core mission critical internal systems by march   and testing of both internally and externally supplied systems must be complete  and all renovation must be substantially complete  by june  in accordance with those guidelines  the company will complete testing of its mission critical systems prior to march  the company expects to meet the deadlines noted above 
as part of the plan  the company has had formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issue and has been following the progress of those vendors with their year compliance status 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and hardware where necessary  the year issue will be mitigated without causing a material adverse impact on the operations of the company or the bank 
at this time  the company anticipates most of its hardware and software to become year compliant  tested and operational within the fdic s suggested time frame 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not timely completed  the year issue could have an impact on the operations of the company or the bank 
despite its best efforts to ensure year compliance  it is possible that one or more of the company s internal or external systems may fail to operate or to operate correctly 
at this time  while the company expects to become year compliant  the probability of such likelihood cannot be determined 
in the event that system failures related to the year issue occur  the company has developed contingency plans  which involve  among other actions  utilization of an alternate service provider or alternate products available through the current vendor 
the company has reviewed its customer base to determine whether they pose significant year risks 
the company s customer base consists primarily of individuals who utilize the company s services for personal  household or consumer uses 
individually  such customers are not likely to pose significant year risks directly 
it is not possible at this time to gauge the indirect risks which could be faced if the employers of such customers encounter unresolved year issues 
monitoring and managing the year issue will result in additional direct and indirect costs to the company 
direct costs include potential charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products that are not enhanced 
indirect costs will principally consist of time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
the company estimates that total costs related to the year issue will not exceed  both direct and indirect costs of addressing the year issue will be charged to earnings as incurred 
to date  over of the total estimated costs associated with the year have already been expensed 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the bank s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements
