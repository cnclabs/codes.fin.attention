item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the company s historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
moreover  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements concerning the company s business and operations 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ due to a variety of risk factors set forth herein and from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission and other public announcements 
overview effective january   the company has changed it fiscal year end from september to december references to fiscal years herein are to the fiscal years of the company ended september of the respective years 
references to the transition period are the three month period ended december  fiscal year and the transition period ended december  was a period of evolution and change for the company 
since the company s initial public offering in  the company has grown significantly through the acquisition of four separate technology companies involved in computer system sales  integration  training and software development 
to focus greater attention on its information technology businesses  the company elected to discontinue its machine vision business in march this business was the core business of the company at its inception and management believed it possessed superior technology in the machine vision industry 
however  uncertainty caused by instability in overseas financial markets principally asia  and geographically segregated management in canada resulted in management concluding that the greatest potential for growth in shareholder value would rest with the company s information technology businesses 
the principal terms of the two offers for mvs are a written offer from an english machine vision company to acquire substantially all of the mvs assets required to produce mvs welding seam tracker and inspection systems the mvs welding products for  in cash at the closing plus a contingent sales price based on revenues generated by the acquired mvs assets during the next two years and the amount of inventory used by the prospective purchaser during the next year in the production of mvs welding products  and an unsolicited oral offer from a canadian machine vision company to pay  in cash at closing for the outstanding stock of mvs  which purchase would transfer substantially all of mvs assets except certain cash on hand and substantially all of mvs liabilities to the prospective purchaser 
the company is evaluating both offers  but is actively engaged in negotiations with the english machine vision company to ascertain whether a definitive asset purchase agreement can be reached 
the oral offer from the canadian machine vision company is subject to obtaining bank financing 
as of the date of this report  the company has not received any substantiation of that the canadian machine vision company has the financial wherewithal to fund its current offer for mvs 
as of march   the company has orally agreed with a buyer to sell the laser welding portion of the business for approximately  plus a contingent amount based upon a percentage of the businesses revenues in the two years following the sale 
the company intends to liquidate the assets of the scanner business of mvs and expects associated proceeds to be nominal 
while management is confident of its ability to reach a definitive agreement to sell a portion of the mvs assets in the near future  no assurances can be given that these efforts will result in definitive agreements being reached or that the company will obtain consideration in any such sale sufficient to recoup any portion of its remaining investment 
fiscal year marked the first full year of operations conducted from the company s  square foot socrates technology center  a full service information technology facility from which the company conducts training services  integrates and manufactures computer systems and houses its executive offices 
fiscal  was also the first full year of operations of its software development business operated from its technet computer services subsidiary 
the company s continuing operations  while showing significant growth  generated an operating loss due to significantly higher amortization associated with goodwill arising from acquisitions  downward pressure on margins from hardware sales  and losses from certain operating divisions with the computer hardware distribution businesses 
these losses led management to reorganize all hardware distribution businesses late in the year under the socrates name and management 
while no assurances can be given as to the success of the reorganization  management believes that by better coordinating sales and marketing efforts and leveraging a single centralized administrative support organization  operating profits will improve 
all results of operations have been restated to reflect the discontinuance of the company s machine vision segment in march as a result  current year to prior year comparisons of results from continuing operations exclude this segment except when noted 
results of operations transition period ended december  compared to comparable period in during the quarter ended december   the company continued the reorganization of its businesses aimed at concentrating on higher margin product  service and training sales 
the effort is concentrated on reconfiguring the operating model of its computer system sales  integration and training business segment to streamline support infrastructure and realigning sales force accountability and focus 
associated with this effort was a significant downsizing of the company operations in new york  acquired in with the acquisition of expert  inc and the folding of the jmr distributors business into socrates technologies 
jmr was involved in the reselling and distribution of computer memory and associated products 
this reorganization had a significant impact on operating results during the transition period ended december  due to downward adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill  inventory and fixed assets associated with reorganized operations 
at the same time  the company continues to be vigorously pursuing growth of its software development business via its technet computer services subsidiary 
the company reported a decrease in sales of  to  for the transition quarter ended december  compared to the comparable quarter ended december  the decrease was due in part to lower sales generated by the company s computer systems sales  integration and training segment consistent with the reorganization of this business to focus on higher margin product sales  particularly in its new york operations and with the planned exit of the low margin memory distribution business 
offsetting this decrease was an increase in sales generated by the company s software development business by  or to  for the quarter ended december  the gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased to from 
contributing to this decrease was an adjustment during the quarter ended december  of approximately  to reduce inventories to net realizable value 
without this adjustment  gross margins increased to 
for the quarter ended december  selling expenses increased by  or to  due to additional personnel costs associated with the expansion of the sales force related to the company s software development business 
administrative expenses increased  or to  as a result of additional reserves for accounts receivable of approximately  and the increase in expenses associated with growth in the company s infrastructure necessary to support future growth 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter ended december  increased by  to  due to an increase in depreciable assets 
during the quarter ended december   the company recorded charges totaling  associated with the restructuring of its computer system sales  integration and training segment 
the charges consisted of non cash write downs of goodwill and inventory associated with certain restructured operations of  and the write down of certain fixed assets which have no continuing value to the company by  in addition  the company recorded a write down of the value of inventories associated with its new york and memory distribution operations of  as a result of reorganizing this business 
investment income and expense  which includes realized gains and losses on marketable securities  decreased in the quarter ended december  compared to the comparable quarter by  to  as a result of lower investment balances and losses of approximately  from the sale of shares of e net  inc in addition  during the quarter ended december   the company recorded a loss of  associated with an early withdrawal penalty charged the company by a financial institution upon withdrawal of funds from an investment account 
the company is disputing the penalty and currently seeking recovery of the funds 
however  the recovery  if any  will be recorded when realized 
in march  the company discontinued its machine vision business and as a result has reported results of operations and losses associated with the discontinuance separately from continuing operations 
since the decision to exit this business was made  the company has been marketing for sale this business 
the company currently is considering offers from two third parties  one for a portion of the business and one for the entire business 
using the lower of these two offers as an indication of the floor value of the net assets of this business  the company recorded a write down of the net assets held for sale during the quarter ended december  of approximately  in addition  the company has provided a reserve of approximately  for estimated operating losses to be incurred from january  to the expected date of sale  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of year ended september  compared to year ended september  the company reported an increase in sales of  or to  for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in sales is attributable to the continued growth in sales generated by the company s computer system sales  integration and training business which rose by  or to  and a full year s sales from its software development business which rose by  or to  due to the inclusion of a full year s sales for this business as it was acquired in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
the gross margins of the company increased slightly to from  for the year ended september   principally as a result of generally higher margins experienced by the software development business  offset by the relatively lower gross profit margins in the company s computer sales  integration and training business 
for the year ended september   selling expenses increased by  or to  primarily as a result of additional sales staff hired and from including a full year s selling and marketing expenses for its software development business  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal administrative expenses increased  or to  for the fiscal year  as a result of increased salary expenses associated with the acquisition late in the prior fiscal year as well as an increase from investments in administrative infrastructure necessary to support growth in operations 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended september   increased by  to  as a direct result of an increase in depreciable assets from the company s businesses and from the resulting goodwill amortization recorded subsequent to the acquisitions 
for acquisitions completed to date  future annual goodwill amortization will be approximately  investment income  which includes realized gains or losses on marketable securities and interest income  net of interest expense and financing charges  increased by  or to  for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to a gain recognized from the sale of shares of e net  inc in june which resulted in a gain of approximately  and interest income from the company s short term us treasury interest bearing investments  offset by realized losses from the liquidation of short term u 
s treasury securities 
both periods reflect interest on line of credit borrowings  and shareholder loans 
management regularly reviews for recoverability deferred tax assets and adjusts  if necessary  a valuation allowance against such assets 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance recorded at september   management considered historical taxable income generated by continuing operations  adjusted for non recurring gains and losses and known charges which are not deductible such as goodwill amortization  and for the anticipated impact of management s operating plans 
the recovery of the deferred tax asset at september  is dependent upon the company generating taxable income in the future sufficient to realize the associated tax benefits 
in the event taxable income is not generated at sufficient levels  write downs of the deferred tax asset may be necessary 
the company has net operating loss carry forwards available to offset us taxable income of approximately  at september   expiring in while the future use of these net operating loss carryforwards has not been significantly affected by the company s past acquisitions  in the event a change in control occurs in the future  use of all or a portion of the us carryforwards could be affected 
in addition  the company has net operating loss and research expenditure carryforwards available to offset future taxable income generated in canada 
however  with the discontinuance of the company s business in canada in the past year  use of such canadian tax benefits is dependent upon the company conducting certain lines of business in canada in the future which management believes is doubtful at the present time 
earnings from continuing operations for the year ended september  were  or per share basic and diluted eps  as compared to earnings from continuing operations of  or per share basic eps and per share diluted eps for the year ended september  in march  the company discontinued its machine vision business and as result has reported results of operations and losses associated with the discontinuance separately from continuing operations 
for the year ended september   this discontinued business incurred an operating loss of  compared to an operating loss of  in the prior year 
in addition  upon making the decision to discontinue the machine vision business  the company incurred a loss of  associated with write downs of inventories  capitalized software costs  and deferred tax assets to net realizable value 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the company reported an increase in sales of  or to  for the year ended september  as compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in sales is attributable to the company s current year acquisitions of expert  inc computer sales  integration and training and technet software development  as well as the inclusion of a full year of sales for socrates  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal despite the increase in sales  the company was impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year by the lack of mvs machine vision scanner sales and the temporary reduction in sales and increase in expenses due to socrates move to its new  square foot facility in largo  maryland 
the gross margins of the company increased to from  for the year ended september   principally as a result of generally higher margins experienced by the software development business acquired in the fourth quarter of  offset by the relatively lower gross profit margins in the company s computer sales  integration and training business 
for the year ended september   selling expenses increased by  to  primarily as a result of additional sales staff hired at mvs and the company s current year acquisitions of expert computer sales  integration and training and technet software development  as well as the inclusion of a full year of selling expenses for socrates  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal administrative expenses increased  to  for the fiscal year  as a result of increased salary expenses associated with the company s year acquisitions  as well as an increase in the company s overall level of operations 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended september   increased by  to  as a direct result of an increase in depreciable assets from the company s acquisitions of expert and socrates and the resulting goodwill amortization recorded subsequent to the acquisitions 
for acquisitions completed to date  future annual goodwill amortization will be approximately  interest income  net of interest expense and financing charges  increased by  from  to  for the year ended september  both periods reflect interest on line of credit borrowings  and shareholder loans 
the company s fourth quarter operations reflect certain adjustments to revise prior estimates associated with cost of sales of the company s computer integration and distribution businesses of approximately  and to revise the provision for income taxes estimated for each interim period  the result being an increase in income tax expense by approximately  in addition  the company recorded changes of approximately  to adjust inventories of its machine vision business to net realizable value 
the effect of these items was to reduce net income for the fourth quarter by  or 
per share 
earnings from continuing operations for the year ended september  were  or per share  as compared to earnings of  or per share basic eps and per share diluted eps for the year ended september  year ended september  compared to year ended september  as a result of the company s discontinuance of its machine vision business  there are no continuing operations for fiscal year for which to make valid comparisons to fiscal year thus  no year to year comparisons are provided 
capital resources  liquidity and backlog as of december   the company had working capital of  and cash  cash equivalents and investments of  the company generated cash from operations during the transition period ended december  of  principally as result of reducing its accounts receivable by  this cash was principally used to reduce borrowings during the quarter 
the company maintains a wholesale financing agreement with a finance company for inventory financing for one of its subsidiaries

amounts due to the finance company under the agreement at december   amounted to  and  and  respectively 
the agreement is subject to annual renewal and is collateralized by all present and future accounts receivable and inventory of the company s subsidiary 
in addition  the company must comply with certain financial and reporting covenants

the facility contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which requires the company to maintain a tangible net worth including subordinated debt of  a ratio of debt minus subordinated debt not to exceed to  and to provide the financing company with weekly borrowing base certificates in order to access the unused portion of the credit facility 
the company has renegotiated its existing wholesale financing agreement in connection with the establishment of this credit facility 
the maximum amount available under the combined agreements is  the amounts due to the finance company under the agreement at december  amounted to  management believes that the working capital and liquidity position of the company  together with funds available under the company s new line of credit  are adequate to meet the company s working capital requirements based upon its current level of operations 
however  significant internal growth or additional acquisitions could create a need for additional working capital 
the company s ability to raise additional funds through secondary offerings of equity or debt securities will be subject to conditions in capital markets  as well as restrictions under its existing credit facilities 
by notice of redemption  dated november   the company called all of its outstanding class a warrants and class b warrants for redemption for cash  on december  the redemption date  at a redemption price of 
per class a warrant and 
per class b warrant the redemption price 
after december   on the redemption date  the only right of any holders of a class a warrant or class b warrant who did not timely exercise  or  in the case of the class a warrant holder  timely trade the warrant  was to receive the redemption price for each warrant properly tendered to american stock transfer trust company  the warrant agent for the warrants

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased  shares of e net stock at prices ranging from to per share  or aggregate consideration of  later in the fourth quarter  the value of e net shares decreased significantly  falling to per share at september   causing the company to suffer unrealized losses of approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal at the present time  the company continues to hold  shares of e net stock 
because e net common stock is highly volatile  the company can make no assurances that the unrealized losses suffered can be recovered 
the company has no significant long term debt outstanding as of december  as of december   the company had borrowed  under two separate loan agreements  monies from a principal stockholder officer edward ratkovich to enable the company to meet its on going cash flow requirements 
these loans bear interest at and  respectively  and are due on demand 
total loans and accrued interest outstanding at december   total  at december   the company s backlog was approximately million 
the company does not believe that its backlog at any specific time is necessarily indicative of its future business 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rates the company does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on sales or income during the past several years 
increases in supplies or other operating costs may adversely affect the company s operations  however  the company believes it may increase prices of its products and systems to offset increases in costs of goods sold or other operating costs 
with the discontinuance of the company s canadian operation in march  the company believes that its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations or deterioration is limited 
seasonality based on its experience to date  the company believes that its future operating results may be subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors  including seasonal changes in the weather  especially in its canadian operations 
such effects may not be apparent in the company s operating results during a period of expansion 
however  the company can make no assurances that its business can be significantly expanded under any circumstances 
year many computerized systems and microprocessor that are embedded in a variety of products either sold or used by the company have the potential for operational problems if the lack the ability to handle the transition to the year the problem generally occurs in systems where functions  which are date sensitive recognize the last two digits in a date field in the year as being the year  causing the product or system to potentially malfunction 
after completing an assessment of the company s information systems for possible issues which could arise as a result of those systems not being year compliant  the company commenced the procurement and installation of a new company wide business and management information system which is year compliant

the upgrade of this subsidiary is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of following this installation  the company plans to conduct a system test to ensure the vendor s claims of year compliance are accurate 
based upon the implementation progress made to date  the company does not believe a contingency plan is necessary 
however  should the testing of the new system cause concerns  a contingency plan will be developed 
expenditures to date and future anticipated expenditures to procure  install  and test the new system have not been significant 
substantially all products sold by the company are manufactured or assembled by third party vendors who warrant their products against defect  including defects associated with the year issue
