in  milacron implemented an integration plan to achieve certain synergies between valenite and widia worldwide 
in  we began managing the valenite and widia carbide insert and steel insert holder businesses on a global scale with a combined management structure and operating with a new brand name  widiavalenite 
the new organization reinforces our global strategy and strengthens our worldwide brand identities and customer focus 
with common tooling brands we expect to benefit from reduced design  manufacturing and marketing costs  higher inventory turnover  improved capacity utilization  and simultaneous product introductions around the world 
we acquired talbot in july  talbot is a major supplier of round high speed steel and carbide metalcutting tools  such as mills and taps  and is the largest us producer of end mills 
these cutting tools  which are not produced by either valenite or widia  are sold through independent distributors and a direct sales force 
the talbot acquisition enabled us to increase our product coverage from approximately to of the types of cutting tools consumed by the world market 
in september   we acquired minnesota twist drill  inc  a manufacturer of standard high speed twist drills which are sold mainly through private branding 
also  in june   we acquired data flute cnc  inc  a manufacturer of high performance solid carbide end mills 
both businesses  with sales of approximately million each  have been integrated with talbot 
on december   we acquired werko  a manufacturer of high speed steel drills 
located in eastern germany  werko has annual sales of approximately million 
we believe it is the third largest european producer of high speed drills 
in addition to our machine tool divestiture  in december  we sold our electronic systems division esd 
to maintain control system continuity and development  milacron entered into an extensive seven year supply contract with the purchaser for electronic controls used on our machinery 
milacron continues to develop and maintain our own applications software 
the decision to sell esd was made to redeploy assets to more strategic businesses 
product development and capital expenditures as part of our objective to enhance milacron s growth potential and global competitiveness  we continue to invest in research and development and in new capital equipment 
research and development investment in totaled million  or of sales 
research and development expense totaled million in and million in in  we invested million for capital additions in our continuing operations  primarily to install advanced technology and increase productive capacity throughout our operations worldwide 
for  we are budgeting an additional million in capital expenditures 
to enhance our research and development effort  we have maintained a major program for product development  process improvement and modernization 
this program is named wolfpack because of its emphasis on teamwork and fierce competitiveness 
the objectives of wolfpack are to design and produce new products at world competitive levels of quality  performance  efficiency and cost 
substantially all of milacron s current plastics technologies machine designs have been developed using the wolfpack methodology 
plastics technologies business we believe milacron is the largest and broadest line us producer of plastics machinery and one of the three largest in the world  as well as the largest us producer of mold bases  standard components and supplies for the moldmaking industry 
in  milacron s plastics technologies segment s sales were million  which included only one quarter s sales for uniloy 
our plastics technologies business sells plastics machinery and supplies for processing plastics to manufacturers in several key industries  including automotive  construction  electronics  consumer goods and packaging 
we believe milacron offers more varieties of machinery to process plastic than any other us company 
one of our strengths in the plastics machinery business is that we offer complete lines of machines for three major plastics processing technologies injection molding and systems for extrusion and blow molding 
another strength is our presence in the durable goods market with the production of mold bases  standard components and supplies for the moldmaking industry 
milacron also sells specialty auxiliary equipment for plastics processing and rebuilds and retrofits older injection molding equipment manufactured by milacron or others 
we distribute all of our plastics machinery products through a combination of a direct sales force and independent agents who are geographically spread throughout our key markets 
we sell our mold bases  supplies and components through a distribution network in the us and europe and through a large network of joint venture sales and service offices in asia 
our plastics technologies businesses sell products primarily in north american and europe 
approximately of the group s sales were to customers located in the eleven european countries which are participating in a new common currency  the euro 
to date  the introduction of the euro has not caused any material changes in our competitive position in the plastics industry or the operation of the business 
while the future impact of the euro is uncertain  management does not expect the introduction of the euro to have a material effect on the business in the future 
plastics technologies industry the market for plastics machinery and supplies for processing plastics has grown steadily over the past four decades 
plastics have continued to replace traditional materials such as metal  wood  glass and paper in an increasing number of manufactured products  particularly in the transportation  construction  housewares  electrical  and medical industries 
advancements in both the development of materials  which make plastic products more functional  and the capabilities of plastics processing equipment have been major contributors to the steady growth in the plastics technologies market 
in addition  consumer demand for safer  more convenient and recyclable products has increased the general demand for plastic products 
like other capital goods markets  machines within the plastics technologies market are subject to economic cycles  but historically to a lesser degree than the machine tools market 
in particular  the market for injection molding machines is driven by resin prices and production  the consumer economy and the construction and automotive industries 
custom molders  which produce a wide variety of components for many industries  are the single largest group of plastics technologies buyers 
other customer categories include the automotive industry  the electrical and packaging industries  the construction industry  manufacturers of housewares and appliances  and producers of consumer goods  toys and medical supplies 
among the factors that affect the plastics technologies market are the health of the consumer economy  residential and commercial construction and automotive production 
because of intense competition from international plastics technologies producers  currency exchange rates also have a significant impact 
fluctuations in the prices of petrochemical feed stocks for resin and subsequent supply of resin may affect the businesses of our customers and  in turn  the market for our products 
environmental concerns about plastics could slow the growth of the plastics technologies market 
however  some plastics raw materials suppliers  machinery makers and processors are developing methods of recycling to address environmental issues 
we believe that environmental concerns have not had any discernible negative effect on the market to date 
nevertheless  milacron  through its membership in the society of plastics industry an industry trade association and this association s affiliate  the american plastics council  is working with other leading companies within the plastics industry to address the role of plastics in the environment 
milacron s plastics technologies business milacron s plastics technologies segment consists of five product lines injection molding machines  extrusion systems  blow molding systems  standardized mold bases  components  supplies for the plastics injection moldmaking industry  and specialty equipment used in the processing of plastics 
injection molding 
we believe milacron is the largest us producer of injection molding machines 
injection molding is the most common and versatile method of processing plastic  and it is used to make a wide variety of parts and products ranging from housewares and consumer goods to medical supplies and industrial components 
milacron manufactures many types of injection molding machines  almost all of which were developed using wolfpack principles 
the injection molding machine line includes machines powered conventionally with hydraulics as well as ones that are driven by servo motors fully electric 
product standardization which facilitates part commonality and the modernization of our manufacturing facilities and methods  as well as increased volumes  have enabled us to achieve significant economies of scale for the production of injection molding machines 
we believe these factors have enabled milacron to become the lowest cost us producer of these machines 
in november   milacron acquired ferromatik  one of europe s leading producers of injection molding machines 
ferromatik is recognized for its high end technology  including multi color machines  multi component systems and other specialty applications 
the acquisition included the ferromatik lines of hydraulic and electric injection molding machines and a modern manufacturing facility in malterdingen  germany  as well as ferromatik s marketing  sales and service network 
the ferromatik acquisition expanded our plastics processing technology base and product line and enabled us to achieve our objective of establishing a plastics machinery manufacturing and distribution base in germany to serve europe and other markets 
ferromatik has provided a complementary fit with milacron s other injection molding machine businesses 
milacron has completed a restructuring of ferromatik designed to derive synergies between ferromatik and other milacron operations and to improve ferromatik operations through implementation of manufacturing techniques and methods used in our us plastics technologies operations 
the restructuring reduced overall marketing costs through the consolidation of milacron s former european marketing organization into the ferromatik marketing organization 
we believe that this restructuring has helped  and will continue to help  us achieve our cost reduction goals in both marketing and manufacturing 
in may   milacron announced the formation of a joint venture  cincinnati milacron pvt 
ltd 
cmpl  with a group of individuals experienced in the building of plastics machinery in ahmedabad  india

milacron also gained a stronger european presence with the acquisition 
extrusion systems 
milacron s extrusion systems business consists of the manufacture  sale and distribution of individual extruders and systems comprised of multiple units which are tooled to extrude a specific product in quantity 
such systems take longer to manufacture than injection molding machines 
extrusion systems  which are manufactured in both the us and austria  include twin screw extruders and single screw extruders 
we believe we have a strong competitive position in each of these lines  and that we are the largest worldwide maker of twin screw extruders 
twin screw extruders are used to produce continuous flow products such as pipe  residential siding  sheet and window frames 
as a result  the business is closely tied to construction market cycles 
single screw extruders are used in a variety of applications and systems such as blow molding  blown film and cast film systems  pipe and profiles and wire and cable applications 
in early  milacron acquired wear technology  which expands our replacement business for both new and rebuilt screws 
mold bases and components 
in january   milacron completed the acquisition of d m e  which we believe is the largest us producer of mold bases  standard components and supplies for the moldmaking industry 
d m e serves customers throughout much of the world with ten major manufacturing facilities and several international joint venture operations 
like most of our plastics business  d m e serves the largest segment of the market  the injection molding process 
d m e complements milacron s other businesses because it provides the mold bases  supplies and components used in the mold apparatus inside injection molding machines 
we believe we are achieving synergies in a number of areas  including manufacturing process  technology  marketing and distribution 
in early  milacron acquired northern supply  a regional catalog distribution company 
northern supply s business is complementary to the catalog business of d m e and is being managed by d m e 
in october   milacron acquired master unit die products  which we believe is the leading north american maker of quick change insert mold bases for the plastics industry 
these mold bases help oem and custom molders achieve quicker production changeovers and lower labor and tooling costs for multiple mold programs 
master unit die has three frame and insert unit product lines  a quick change adapter frame for standard mold bases  and a complete line of related components and accessories 
specialty equipment 
milacron sells a variety of specialty equipment used in the processing of plastics products  including peripheral auxiliary equipment such as material management systems  heat exchangers and product handling systems  all of which are manufactured by third parties to milacron s specifications

in  we formally dedicated a new sales and marketing office in singapore and expect to continue to expand our presence in this region 
competition the markets for plastics technologies in north america and worldwide are highly competitive and are made up of a number of us  european and asian competitors 
we believe milacron has a significant share of the us market for the types of products it produces  and that we are the broadest line manufacturer of equipment  supplies and systems for plastics processing in the world 
our competitors vary in size and resources  some are larger than us  most are smaller  and only a few compete in more than one product category 
principal competitive factors in the plastics technologies industry are product features  technology  quality  performance  reliability  speed of delivery  price and customer service 
the wolfpack program is designed to maintain and enhance our competitive position worldwide with respect to each of these competitive factors 
in addition  we focus on new product development  the containment of costs  maintaining competitive market pricing and expanded marketing in order to maintain and grow our presence in the market 
cutting process technologies business milacron produces five basic types of industrial products metalcutting tools  metalworking fluids  precision grinding wheels  carbide wear parts and industrial magnets  in total representing over  different products 
in  sales for our cutting process technologies segment were million 
we believe milacron is a leader in many new product technologies  including synthetic lubricants  use of synthetic ceramic abrasives  high performance cutting tool coatings  and product designs using computer modeling 
over of this segment s sales are of consumable products and components 
consumable products are depleted during the process for which they are used  offering us a continuous opportunity to sell replacement products to our customers 
we believe that milacron s cutting process technologies business complements our plastics machinery businesses  because the cutting process technologies business is exposed to less pronounced business cycles 
our cutting process technologies businesses sell products primarily in north america  europe and asia 
approximately of the group s sales were to customers located in the eleven european countries which are participating in a new common currency  the euro 
to date  the introduction of the euro has not caused any material changes in our competitive position in the industry or the operation of the business 
management recognizes that we  along with our competitors  could experience adverse price realization over the longer term as a result of price transparency associated with single currency pricing in those countries 
while the future impact of the euro is uncertain  we do not expect this to have a material adverse effect on milacron 
cutting process technologies industry milacron s cutting process technologies business participates in a billion world market  which has historically grown at a rate approximating the growth of the world gdp 
milacron s products address approximately billion of this market 
we have the heaviest market penetration in the us and europe  and in the case of metalcutting tools  india 
we serve customers in the industrial components and machinery  automotive and electrical industries  as well as job shops 
milacron s cutting process technologies business metalcutting tools carbide inserts and round tools 
metalcutting tools are made of carbide  steel and other materials and include systems to hold metalcutting tools 
they are used on machine tools for use in a wide variety of metalcutting operations 
we believe that through our widiavalenite and talbot businesses  we are the second largest producer of carbide metalcutting tool systems in the us and the third largest worldwide 
in addition  we believe that we are also the third largest producer of round tools in north america 
valenite manufactures over  products  including an extensive line of cutting tool inserts in a wide variety of materials and geometries for turning  boring  milling and drilling  and standard and special steel insert holders 
valenite has an excellent market position in the automotive  off road vehicle and truck industries and has strong market positions in carbide wear parts for metalforming and in products requiring the wear and corrosion resistant properties of tungsten carbide 
in february   milacron completed the acquisition of widia  a major european metalcutting tool maker with key production facilities in germany and other western european countries 
widia also owns a interest in widia india ltd  an indian public company 
widia s product lines include tungsten carbide cutting tool inserts and steel insert holders needed for metalcutting operations  carbide wear parts used in forming and stamping metal  and both soft and permanent industrial magnets  used in automotive and other applications 
in  milacron initiated a million plan to integrate certain valenite and widia operations  primarily in europe and japan 
this plan involved the closing of two manufacturing plants  the downsizing of another plant  as well as the consolidation of numerous sales  customer service and warehousing operations in europe and japan 
in total  the execution of the plan has resulted in the elimination of over production and administrative personnel 
as a result  milacron is achieving annual cost savings in excess of million 
in addition  a global management organization was announced in  as described on page in july   we completed the acquisition of talbot  a major supplier of round high speed steel and carbide metalcutting tools 
talbot is the largest us producer of end mills  as well as a leading tap producer 
with annual sales at that time of approximately million  talbot enabled us to enter the market for round tools  including high speed steel and carbide end mills  taps  countersinks  counterbores and reamers 
these products are highly complementary to the products made by widiavalenite 
we expect to expand talbot products into non us markets 
to further broaden our product coverage in the round metalworking tooling business  we made two smaller acquisitions in minnesota twist drill  inc  a manufacturer of standard high speed twist drills in its chisholm  minnesota plant and data flute cnc  inc  a manufacturer of high performance solid carbide end mills located in pittsfield  massachusetts 
these acquisitions are highly complementary to our valenite and talbot product lines and broaden our already extensive product offerings in the market place 
in  we initiated a million expansion program  which includes a second plant for data flute  a doubling of production capacity at minnesota twist drill and the expansion of a talbot facility 
in december  we acquired werko  the german high speed steel drill and tap producer  in order to enter the european market for round tools 
werko also gives us a full line of high speed steel drills in metric sizes and completes our inch sized line 
metalworking fluids 
metalworking fluids are proprietary chemical compounds and emulsions used as lubricants  coolants and corrosion inhibitors in a wide variety of metalcutting and metalforming operations

acquisitions in february   we acquired wear technology and northern supply 
wear technology is a mcpherson  kansas company with annual sales of approximately million which primarily serves the aftermarket for new and rebuilt twin screws for extrusion systems 
northern supply  with annual sales of approximately million  offers supplies to plastics processors for injection molding  blow molding and extrusion through distribution centers in minneapolis  minnesota and charlotte  north carolina 
in may   milacron acquired autojectors  inc  a leading us producer of vertical insert injection molding machinery widely used to make medical  electrical and automotive components 
with annual sales of approximately million  autojectors operates through two manufacturing facilities near fort wayne  indiana 
effective september   milacron acquired master unit die products  inc  a leading north american manufacturer of quick change mold bases for the plastics industry 
master unit die products has annual sales in excess of million 
also on september   milacron acquired the assets of uniloy  the plastics machinery division of johnson controls  inc  for approximately million  subject to post closing adjustments 
uniloy  which is known for its uniloy brand of equipment  as well as various other brands  had sales of more than million for the fiscal year ending on september   and is one of the world s leading providers of blow molding machines  as well as structural foam systems  aftermarket parts  services and molds for blowmolding 
on december   milacron acquired werkzeugfabrik gmbh konigsee werko  a manufacturer of high speed steel drills 
located in eastern germany  werko has annual sales of approximately million 
with the exception of werko  all of the businesses purchased in are included in the plastics technologies segment from the respective dates of acquisition 
in the aggregate  these acquisitions had the effect of increasing new orders and sales by million and million  respectively  in relation to werko is included in the consolidated balance sheet at december   and will be included in the operating results of the cutting process technologies segment beginning in in  milacron acquired two businesses data flute cnc in june and minnesota twist drill in september 
both businesses are included in the cutting process technologies segment 
these acquisitions resulted in an increase in new orders and sales in of approximately million in relation to in january   milacron acquired d m e  which is included in the company s plastics technologies segment for eleven months of all of the acquisitions were financed by the use of available cash and bank borrowings and have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
presence outside the us in recent years  milacron s growth outside the us has allowed it to become more globally balanced 
in  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of consolidated sales europe  asia  canada and mexico  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
in and early  the british pound was somewhat stable in relation to the us dollar while the german mark continued to weaken 
however  during the second quarter of  the german mark also stabilized and then strengthened slightly 
as a result  milacron experienced favorable currency translation effects on new orders and sales of about million in the effect on earnings from continuing operations was not significant 
there was a million increase in shareholders equity due to foreign currency translation effects in this amount excludes million of unfavorable currency translation effects that are included in the loss on the sale of mtg 
if non us currencies should weaken against the non us dollar in future periods  milacron will experience a negative effect on translating non us new orders  sales and  possibly  net earnings in the future when compared with historical results 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from  million in excluding the effect of acquisitions  new orders were million higher in orders for plastics technologies products increased by million  or  excluding the acquisitions  orders increased by approximately 
orders for cutting process technologies products increased by million  or  excluding the effect of the acquisitions  new orders were flat  due principally to the general motors strike 
us export orders were million in representing a increase from million in uniloy accounted for about one half of the increase 
the company s backlog of unfilled orders totaled million at december  this compares to million at december   and million at december  sales sales in were  million  which represented a million  or  increase from  million in excluding the effect of acquisitions  consolidated sales decreased modestly in relation to sales of plastics technologies products increased by million  or 
the segment s sales include an incremental million related to acquisitions 
sales of cutting process technologies products increased by million  or  excluding the effect of the acquisitions  sales in approximated the amount 
export sales were million in compared to million in the amount includes million for uniloy 
sales of both segments to non us markets  including exports  totaled million  a decrease in of million 
in and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively 
margins  costs and expenses the manufacturing margin percent of in increased from in margins for both segments showed improvement in both the us and in europe 
in  margins in the plastics technologies segment had been held back by pricing pressure on us built injection molding machines  which began to ease in the third quarter of that year 
total selling and administrative expense increased in amount in relation to however  these expenses decreased modestly in as a percentage of sales due to increased sales volume 
other expense net  including amortization of goodwill  increased to million in from million in the amount includes severance expenses totaling approximately million relating to approximately employees at widia  the company s european cutting tool company and at the company s extrusion machinery facility in austria 
as a result of these and other actions at widia and in austria  we expect to achieve annualized pretax savings of approximately million  which began to phase in during the fourth quarter of for widia and which will phase in during in austria 
the expense included severance expenses of approximately million relating to ferromatik  the company s german injection molding machine subsidiary 
annual cost savings from this and other cost reduction measures at ferromatik were approximately million 
interest expense net  including amortization of debt issuance costs  increased in due primarily to higher average debt levels associated with acquisitions 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority shareholders interests earnings before income taxes and minority shareholders interests of million in exceeded the million earned in by million  or 
as a percentage of sales  pretax earnings improved significantly from to  which is largely the result of improved manufacturing margins as discussed above 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in and includes us federal and state and local income taxes and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us milacron entered both years with sizeable net operating loss nol carryforwards  along with valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions against the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and reversed when it is determined to be more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
the reversal of these valuation allowances  as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  serves to reduce the effective tax rate 
valuation allowances subject to future reversal were million at year end  including million related to werko 
we anticipate that these valuation allowances will be approximately to million at year end the effective tax rate for is expected to increase to within a range of approximately 
however  the tax rate will ultimately be contingent on the mix of earnings between tax jurisdictions and other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations  net of minority shareholders interests  were million  or per share diluted  in compared with million  or per share diluted  in the increase in earnings is caused by improved operating margins offset by higher interest cost and a higher effective tax rate 
discontinued operations in  discontinued operations includes a provision for the loss on the sale of mtg of million  or 
per share diluted  and after tax earnings from operations of million  or 
per share diluted 
net earnings for  net earnings were million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  for the most significant items affecting the net earnings comparison between years was the loss on the sale of mtg and its lower operating earnings in prior to the sale 
compared to new orders and backlog new orders in were  million  which represented an million  or  increase from  million in orders for plastics technologies products increased by million  or  principally due to increased orders for us built injection molding machines 
orders for cutting process technologies products increased by million  or  of which million resulted from the acquisitions 
excluding the effect of acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects  new orders increased for this segment by as all major us product lines showed improvement 
us export orders were million in compared to million in the company s backlog of unfilled orders totaled million at december  this compares to million at december  sales sales in were  million  which represented an million  or  increase over this increase was caused principally by internal growth in the plastics technologies segment 
sales in were adversely affected by million of unfavorable currency translation effects 
excluding the acquisitions and currency translation effects  sales increased by 
sales of plastics technologies increased by million  or  primarily due to increased sales of us built injection molding machines 
cutting process technologies sales increased by million  or 
however  after excluding the acquisitions and currency translation effects  sales increased by million  or 
sales of both segments to non us markets totaled million  a decrease in of million 
in and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively 
margins  costs and expenses manufacturing margins as a percent of sales were in and in margins for cutting process technologies products improved in  while margins for plastics technologies products were depressed through the first three quarters of due to pricing pressures on us built injection molding machines 
the segment s margins improved in the fourth quarter of total selling and administrative expense increased in amount  as expected  due to increases in certain selling costs that vary with sales levels 
administrative expenses increased modestly 
as a percent to sales  selling expense declined to approximately of sales and administrative expenses remained at approximately of sales 
other expense net increased to million in from million in the increase was caused primarily by the absence of favorable settlements of legal claims that are included in the amount and the inclusion of severance expense of approximately million in the first quarter of relating to approximately employees at ferromatik  the company s german injection molding machine subsidiary 
interest expense net of interest income was million in compared with million in the decrease was due to lower average debt levels and lower borrowing rates as well as the effects of foreign currency translation 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and minority shareholders interests earnings before income taxes and minority shareholders interests were million in  which represented an increase of million  or  in relation to million in as a percentage of sales  pretax earnings increased from to due principally to modestly higher manufacturing margins and reduced interest cost 
income taxes the provision for income taxes in and includes us federal and state and local income taxes  and income taxes in other jurisdictions outside the us milacron entered both years with sizeable net operating loss nol carryforwards  along with valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions against the nol carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we periodically reevaluate the future realization of all deferred tax assets 
during the period  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of these assets would be offset against future taxable income 
as a result  we reversed valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions which caused the provision for income taxes to be less than the statutory rate 
earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations were million  or per share diluted  an increase of over million  or per share diluted in the increase resulted principally from increased pretax earnings as discussed above and a lower effective tax rate 
net earnings net earnings  including the operating results of the discontinued machine tools segment  were million  or per share diluted in  compared with million  or per share diluted in net earnings increased  while per share earnings increased  which also includes the effect of increased common shares outstanding throughout year the term year problem yk refers to processing difficulties that may occur in information technology it systems  and other equipment with embedded microprocessors  that were designed without considering the distinction between dates in the s and the s 
if not corrected  these systems could fail or miscalculate data when processing date sensitive information that includes a date on or after january  each of milacron s business units  as well as our corporate headquarters  are responsible for developing and executing comprehensive plans to minimize  and to the extent possible  eliminate any major business interruptions that could be caused by the yk issue 
we have established an executive level yk compliance committee  which is monitoring our progress toward yk preparedness 
this monitoring process includes testing by our internal auditors and considering reports from limited reviews conducted by outside consultants to identify issues requiring attention by the compliance committee 
milacron s yk effort focuses primarily on three important elements it systems  it equipment that includes embedded microprocessors  and supplier preparedness 
most of our efforts to date have focused on our most critical it business systems it  financial  enterprise resource planning  or erp 
each of our ten major manufacturing locations operate unique information technology systems which have been selected to best serve that business s needs 
four of these businesses operate systems that are licensed from independent third party software providers and require third party updates to be yk compliant 
milacron is cooperating with and relying on these third parties to replace or upgrade its software with yk compliant software on a timely basis 
we are installing and testing the new software to provide assurance that the updated systems will properly process date sensitive information 
these systems have already been updated  except for one that is scheduled to be updated in the first half of five other businesses are using the yk compliance process as an opportunity to modernize their systems by installing new erp systems licensed from independent software providers 
all of the erp system installations were completed by january  another business unit operates its own proprietary business systems  which are being reprogrammed to be yk compliant  over of the applications have already been remediated with the balance expected to be remediated in the first half of in addition  milacron is in the process of completing inventories  assessments and testing of non it systems eg  production equipment which may contain embedded chips  which could malfunction with the approach of the year wherever critical systems are identified as not being compliant  milacron plans to remediate or replace these non compliant systems 
the remediation phase of this effort is expected to be substantially completed by june  all business units are in the process of contacting key vendors and service providers to obtain information about their plans and progress on yk issues and to obtain their assurances that they expect to be able to provide an uninterrupted flow of product or service approaching and into the year we are following up on significant concerns that are identified as a result of these communications and  in some cases  may be arranging alternative sources of that product or service 
in  we focused on preventing significant yk failures  rather than preparing formal  written contingency plans 
however  in milacron intends to prepare contingency plans  if any major systems or suppliers are identified as representing a significant risk of yk failure 
many of our machinery products rely upon computer controls and embedded microprocessors to achieve optimum performance 
we are making information available publicly to our customers on the yk status of these products  substantially all of which are yk compliant 
milacron has estimated the cost of major system implementation and remediation efforts 
however  other costs are being absorbed in departmental operating budgets 
based on currently available information  we estimate that the incremental cost of these major implementation and remediation projects will be approximately million over  and  of which over has been expended through december  these costs are not expected to have a material effect on milacron s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
milacron recognizes that the yk issue could result in the interruption or failure of certain normal business operations which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
we believe that the reasonable worst case scenario is that milacron could encounter production and shipment delays caused in large part by vendors  service providers and other third parties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the yk preparedness of third parties  we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of the yk issue will have a material impact on milacron s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
however  as a result of our past and future yk activities  we believe that the risk of significant interruption of normal operations should be reduced 
market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk milacron uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to firm commitments arising from international transactions 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on milacron s foreign exchange contracts at december   would not materially affect consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk at december   milacron had fixed interest rate debt of million  including million of notes due may   and million of notes due march  milacron also had floating rate debt totaling million  with interest fluctuating based primarily on changes in libor 
milacron also sells up to million of accounts receivable under its receivables purchase agreement  which results in financing fees that fluctuate based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result  annual interest expense and financing fees in will fluctuate based upon fluctuations in short term borrowing rates 
liquidity and sources of capital at december   milacron had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million in operating activities provided million of cash in  compared with million provided in the decrease in cash provided resulted in part from higher inventory levels to support sales growth that did not materialize when expected and new product introductions 
in  investing activities resulted in a million use of cash  due to capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million  including million for the uniloy acquisition 
cash flows from investing activities benefited by million from the sale of mtg 
in  investing activities used million of cash  including capital expenditures of million 
financing activities provided million of cash in  compared with a use of million in the amount includes a million net increase in debt to finance acquisitions and repurchase common shares as described below  offset by proceeds from the mtg divestiture 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced a two million common share repurchase program  of which million shares were purchased through december  including shares purchased earlier in the year to partially meet the anticipated needs of management incentive  employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans  milacron used million of cash for share repurchases in as of december   milacron s current ratio was  as compared to at december  the decrease in the current ratio is principally the result of the mtg sale and the uniloy acquisition 
as of december   milacron had lines of credit with various us and us banks of approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
under the provisions of the facility  our additional borrowing capacity totaled approximately million at december  total debt was million at december   representing an increase of million from december  the increase was caused primarily by increased borrowings to finance acquisitions and the share repurchase program  offset in part by the proceeds from the mtg sale 
total shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the modest increase resulted principally from earnings from continuing operations and favorable foreign currency translation effects  offset by the loss from discontinued operations and the effect of the share repurchase program 
the ratio of total debt to total capital debt plus equity was at december   compared with at december we believe that milacron s cash flow from operations and its currently available credit lines are sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements in outlook while the asian recession and softness in certain north american and european industrial sectors persist  business levels remain healthy in many other economic sectors 
in addition  both of milacron s business segments have established leadership positions in their respective markets and can be expected to benefit from the cost reduction measures taken in recent years 
therefore  unless there is unforeseen deterioration in major world markets  milacron believes it can achieve continued growth in sales  earnings and cash flow 
cautionary statement milacron wishes to caution readers about all of the forward looking statements in the outlook section above and elsewhere 
these include all statements that speak about the future or are based on our interpretation of factors that might affect our businesses 
milacron believes the following important factors  among others  could affect its actual results in and beyond and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements global and regional economic conditions  consumer spending and industrial production  particularly in segments related to the level of automotive production and spending in the construction industry  fluctuations in currency exchange rates of us and foreign countries  including countries in europe and asia where milacron has several principal manufacturing facilities and where many of our competitors and suppliers are based  fluctuations in domestic and non us interest rates which affect the cost of borrowing under milacron s lines of credit and financing fees related to the sale of domestic accounts receivable  production and pricing levels of important raw materials  including plastic resins  which are a key material used by purchasers of milacron s plastics technologies products  and steel  cobalt  tungsten and industrial grains used in the production of metalworking products  lower than anticipated levels of plant utilization resulting in production inefficiencies and higher costs  whether related to the delay of new product introductions  improved production processes or equipment  or labor relation issues  any major disruption in production at key customer or supplier facilities  alterations in trade conditions in and between the us and us countries where milacron does business  including export duties  import controls  quotas and other trade barriers  changes in tax  environmental and other laws and regulations in the us and us countries where milacron does business  unanticipated litigation  claims or assessments  including but not limited to claims or problems related to product liability  warranty  or environmental issues  the failure of key vendors  software providers  public utilities  financial institutions or other critical suppliers to provide products or services that are yk compliant
