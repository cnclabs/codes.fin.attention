total assets      long term debt at year end item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources x rite has a strong financial position  excellent liquidity and is virtually debt free 
since  the company has been able to fund its operating  investing and financing activities from operating cash flows and existing cash reserves 
on january  the company had cash and short term investments totaling million and an unused line of credit of million 
working capital on january  was million and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was cash provided by operating activities in was million 
the primary source of cash was net income 
included in net income were certain accounting charges that did not require the use of cash 
the most significant non cash accounting charges  which totaled million  were depreciation  amortization and the write down of digital imaging assets 
capital expenditures of million in were made primarily for machinery  equipment  building improvements  and computer hardware and software 
the company expects capital expenditures in to total approximately million and consist mainly of machinery  equipment  building improvements  and computer hardware and software 
during  the company announced it had entered into agreements with its founding shareholders for the future redemption of million shares  or percent of the company s outstanding stock 
the stock redemptions will occur following the later of the death of each founder and his spouse 
the cost of the redemption agreements will be funded by proceeds from life insurance policies totaling million the company has purchased on the lives of certain of these individuals 
the price the company will pay the founders estates for these shares will reflect a percent discount from the market price  although the discounted price may not be less than per share or more than per share 
at the maximum price  the aggregate stock purchases will total million 
the company anticipates that certain stock purchases will not coincide with the receipt of insurance proceeds  therefore  borrowed funds will be needed from time to time to finance the company s purchase obligations 
insurance was purchased at the million level in order to cover both the maximum aggregate purchase price and anticipated borrowing costs 
life insurance premiums will total million each year while all the policies remain in effect 
of the million paid in  approximately million was classified as cash surrender value which is included with other noncurrent assets on the company s balance sheet 
the company made one business acquisition in a branch of an x rite dealer located near paris  france was purchased in a cash transaction 
this acquisition was part of the company s long term strategic plan to expand its european sales and marketing infrastructure 
dividends of million were paid at the annual rate of cents per share  which is the rate the board of directors intends to continue paying in the foreseeable future 
management expects that x rite s current liquidity  combined with cash flow from future operations and the company s million revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to finance the company s operations  life insurance premiums  capital expenditures and dividends for the foreseeable future 
in the event more funds are required  additional short or long term borrowing arrangements are the most likely alternatives for meeting liquidity and capital resource needs 
the following table sets forth information derived from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling marketing engineering  general administrative research development write down of digital imaging assets operating income other income income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales net sales in declined compared to the year over year decrease was attributable to weak sales to key customers in north america 
net sales in increased compared to due to unit volume increases 
price increases had a nominal effect on sales levels in and gross profit the range of gross profit as a percentage of sales varied slightly during the three year period ended january  gross profit percentages were  and in  and  respectively 
the variations were due to changes in product sales mix 
selling and marketing expenses in the company increased the level of investment in sales and marketing in order to position itself for continued long term sales growth 
emphasis was placed on building additional infrastructure in europe and  to a lesser extent  asia 
selling and marketing expenses increased in and in terms of actual costs incurred  however  as a percentage of sales and expenditures actually declined from preceding years 
engineering  general and administrative the increase in engineering  general and administrative eg a expenses in over was due primarily to life insurance premium expense incurred in connection with the stock redemption program  higher legal fees  wage inflation for technical talent and costs attributable to the new office opened in france 
eg a expenses in were higher compared to due to the inclusion in of light source operating costs and light source goodwill amortization  no comparable expenses were incurred in research and development new product innovation has been an essential part of building x rite s strong financial position

write down of digital imaging assets the company recognized a nonrecurring charge of  in the third quarter of for the write down of certain digital imaging assets associated with the acquisition of light source computer images  inc see note to the accompanying financial statements 
increased competition in the digital imaging business and a continued rapid decline in the demand for certain digital imaging instruments  software and technology were the primary factors that led the company to reevaluate the markets light source sells into and the light source product lines  which then forced the recognition of this charge 
digital imaging markets have been changing rapidly and the demand for newer products at lower prices with enhanced performance has impacted the company s ability to compete in certain of these markets 
in addition  the company has decided these assets would not be employed in a separate strategic business unit within the reorganized corporate structure that was announced during the third quarter 
the company will continue developing other digital imaging products for markets where it has more experience and greater name recognition 
other income other income in  and consisted mainly of interest earned on funds invested in tax exempt securities 
interest income in was less than due to a reduction in funds available to invest 
in  a substantial portion of the company s short term investments were used to acquire the assets of another company 
income taxes the effective tax rate in was compared to in and in the tax rates have been affected by higher state income taxes and lower federal tax benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation 
inflation the company has experienced the effects of inflation on its business through increases in the cost of services  employee compensation and fringe benefits 
although modest adjustments to selling prices have mitigated the effects of inflation  the company continues to explore ways to improve productivity and reduce operating costs 
the company does not anticipate any significant adverse impact from inflation in the coming year 
most of the company s transactions are invoiced and paid in us dollars
