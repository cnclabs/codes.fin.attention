item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in february  genta has devoted its principal efforts toward drug discovery  research and development 
genta has been unprofitable to date and  even if it obtains financing to continue its operations  expects to incur substantial operating losses due to continued requirements for ongoing research and development activities  preclinical and clinical testing  manufacturing activities  regulatory activities  and establishment of a sales and marketing organization 
from the period since its inception to december   the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of million 
the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and it expects that these fluctuations in revenues  expenses and losses will continue  although mitigated by recent developments 
the company has been reducing its human and other resources to reduce expenses while focusing its research and development r d efforts 
genta s strategy is to build a product and technology portfolio focusing on its anticode tm antisense products intended to treat cancer at its genetic source 
to this end  the company has reduced its r d expenses by about from last year and has significantly reduced its involvement with respect to its investment in an r d joint venture  genta jago  through an interim agreement reached in march the company also entered into an asset purchase agreement on march  for the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the company s wholly owned specialty chemicals subsidiary jbl scientific  inc jbl for cash  a promissory note and certain pharmaceutical development services in support of genta s g development project 
the transaction will be consummated upon the satisfaction of certain closing conditions and  while there can be no assurances  is expected to be completed in the second quarter of following the pending sale of jbl  the company will operate as one business segment 
accordingly  the following information and accompanying financial statements reflect jbl as a discontinued operation 
the company has closed its operation in france 
the company has also closed its facilities in san diego  california and has moved its headquarters to lexington  massachusetts as of the second quarter of the company s independent auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the company s consolidated financial statements at december   that expresses substantial doubt as to the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company has very limited cash resources 
its ability to continue operations in depends upon the consummation of the jbl transaction and the company s success in obtaining funding 
there can be no assurance that the jbl transaction will be consummated or as to the timing thereof or that the company will be able to obtain additional funds on satisfactory terms or at all 
there are several factors that must be considered risks in that regard and those that are known to management are discussed in md a certain trends and uncertainties 
the statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including statements regarding the expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
the company intends that all forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements reflect the company s views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many risks and uncertainties  which could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
examples of such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  obtaining sufficient financing to maintain the company s planned operations  the timely development  receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and acceptance of new products  the successful application of the company s technology to produce new products  the obtaining of proprietary protection for any such technology and products  the impact of competitive products and pricing and reimbursement policies  changing market conditions and the other risks detailed in the certain trends and uncertainties section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company does not undertake to update any forward looking statements 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations relates to the company s continuing business 
operating revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in the changes in operating revenue have largely reflected the company s lessened involvement in genta jago development activities 
related party contract revenues decreased from million in  to  in and  in the expenses for which these revenues are recognized as costs and expenses in the same period such that the net effect on genta s consolidated statements is zero see below 
it is anticipated that  as the company has reduced its resources and focused them on its development of its lead anticode tm oligonucleotide  g  this trend will continue 
it should be noted that at the same time  the company is reducing its commitment to provide funds to genta jago 
on march   genta and skyepharma on behalf of itself and its affiliates entered into an interim agreement pursuant to which the parties to the joint venture released each other from all liability relating to unpaid development costs and funding obligations 
skyepharma agreed to be responsible for substantially all the obligations of the joint venture to third parties and for the further development of the joint venture s products  with any net income resulting therefrom to be allocated in agreed upon percentages between genta and skyepharma as set forth in such interim agreement 
it is also expected that the completion of the sale of the assets of jbl will result in a significant decrease in ongoing revenues  as all of the company s product sales have been attributable to jbl 
collaborative research and development revenues were  annually in and in  representing deferred revenues recognized pursuant to the company s collaboration with johnson johnson consumer products  inc see business anticode tm brand of antisense oligonucleotide programs oligonucleotide collaborative and licensing agreements other anticode agreements 
the above agreement has expired 
costs and expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in primarily  the overall decrease reflects reduced research and development and general and administrative charges offset by nonrecurring charges related to restructuring 
the decrease in r d expenses is the result of work force reductions and related closure of research and development facilities in san diego 
services and capabilities that have not been retained within the company are out sourced through short term contracts or from consultants 
all preclinical biology and clinical trial work is now conducted through such collaborations with external scientists and clinicians 
the company anticipates that  if sufficient collaborative revenues and other funding are available  research and development expenses may increase in future years due to requirements for preclinical studies  clinical trials  the g anticode oligonucleotide program and increased regulatory costs 
the company will be required to assess the potential costs and benefits of developing its own anticode tm oligonucleotide manufacturing  marketing and sales activities if and as such products are successfully developed and approved for marketing  as compared to establishing a corporate partner relationship 
research and development expenses totaled million in  million in  and million in the decrease in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the company s redeployment of certain employees  and related workforce reductions implemented in and see below together with the discontinuation of several programs 
research and development and certain other services the company provided to genta jago under the terms of the joint venture were significantly reduced over the period from through these amounts were million in   in and  in there is  however  no net effect of these reductions in services to genta jago as they are offset by related party contract revenues 
it is anticipated that research and development expenses may increase in the future  assuming the company obtains sufficient financing  as the development program for g expands and more patients are treated in clinical trials at higher doses  through longer or more treatment cycles  or both 
furthermore  the company is pursuing other opportunities for new product development candidates which  if successful  will require additional research and development expenses 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trials will proceed in this manner or that the company will initiate new development programs 
in an effort to focus its research and development on areas that provide the most significant commercial opportunities  the company continually evaluates its ongoing programs in light of the latest market information and conditions  availability of third party funding  technological advances  and other factors 
as a result of such evaluation  the company s product development plans have changed from time to time  and the company anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the million decrease in reflects reductions in staff and in accounting and legal expenses 
legal expenses were higher in due to several factors successfully defending the litigation brought by certain of the company s preferred stockholders challenging a million investment made in february  which litigation was resolved in the company s favor in april  and the company s successful efforts to avoid a potential nasdaq delisting associated with the equity offerings consummated in see legal proceedings and market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities 
as a continuation of its restructuring plan  in october genta reassessed its personnel requirements and established a termination plan whereby the company terminated research and administrative employees and recorded general and administrative expenses of  for accrued severance 
in may  genta again reassessed its personnel requirements and established another termination plan involving the termination of research and administrative employees 
the company recorded general and administrative expenses of  in the second quarter of for accrued severance costs 
in  three additional staff personnel left the company  and two senior managers joined the company 
another senior manager joined the company in although the company has reduced its work force to a core group of corporate personnel  the remaining team is able to maintain genta s operations in the development of g chemical and manufacturing development and quality assurance and control is managed or conducted at jbl  in coordination with genta s core staff 
it is expected that these services will continue in following the completion of the sale of substantially all of jbl s assets and certain liabilities 
the jbl asset purchase agreement contemplates that  after the closing of the sale  the acquiring company will provide pharmaceutical development services to the company at no additional charge 
the company recorded charges to general and administrative expenses of  and  in and respectively to account for the value of abandoned patents no longer related to the research and development efforts of the company 
the company s policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of carrying values of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated future cash flows undiscounted and other factors 
if such evaluation were to identify a material impairment of these intangible assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable assets 
the company continues to evaluate the continuing value of patents and patent applications  particularly as expenses to prosecute or maintain these patents come due 
through this evaluation  the company may elect to continue to maintain these patents  seek to out license them  or abandon them 
the company s equity in net loss of its joint venture genta jago totaled million in  compared to million in and  in the decrease in the company s equity in net loss of its joint venture during relative to and is largely attributable to the fact that development efforts are now focused exclusively on geomatrix based products and a greater portion of development activities were funded pursuant to genta jago s collaborative agreements with third parties 
the operating results of genta jago are based primarily on three factors 
first  genta jago receives collaborative research and development revenue from third parties 
secondly  genta jago is billed by jagotec and genta for research and development costs associated with genta jago projects 
thirdly  there are general and administrative costs associated with the joint venture 
through may  genta jago s development efforts were not strictly geomatrix based products 
genta jago also had the right to develop six anticode tm oligonucleotide products licensed from genta 
however  in the parties elected to focus genta jago s activities exclusively on geomatrix based products 
in connection with the return of the anticode tm oligonucleotide technology license rights to genta in may  genta jago s note payable to genta was credited with approximately million in principal and million in accrued interest 
genta jago recorded the loan credit and related accrued interest as a gain on waiver of debt in exchange for return of license rights to related party 
furthermore  since genta jago was no longer responsible for developing anticode tm oligonucleotide products  its future working capital requirements were reduced 
the equity in net loss of joint venture is determined by reducing the loss per genta jago financials by genta s markup on internal costs for which the joint venture is billed plus the interest accrued on the working capital loans 
since the formation of genta jago  no products have been successfully developed and marketed 
since the initial plans called for earlier introductions and since there have been significant changes in the market environment since the company entered into the joint venture  there is reason to believe that any products that may be marketed in the future could represent significantly poorer financial opportunities than those that were anticipated in the earlier plans 
this reduction in opportunity derives from factors such as the presence of direct competitors to genta jago s products being in the marketplace before genta jago  and increasing pricing pressures on pharmaceuticals  particularly multisource or generic products from payers such as reimbursers and government buyers 
see md a certain trends and uncertainties uncertainty of technological change and competition and md a certain trends and uncertainties uncertainty of product pricing  reimbursement and related matters 
both of these factors may adversely affect genta jago even if it is successful in developing products to obtain regulatory approval 
as a result and in consideration of the company s need to reduce expenses and focus its efforts  the company is directing its resources from the joint venture to its anticode development  specifically g  for the immediate future 
on march   genta and skyepharma on behalf of itself and its affiliates entered into an interim agreement pursuant to which the parties to the joint venture released each other from all liability relating to unpaid development costs and funding obligations 
skyepharma agreed to be responsible for substantially all the obligations of the joint venture to third parties and for the further development of the joint venture s products  with any net income resulting therefrom to be allocated in agreed upon percentages between genta and skyepharma as set forth in such interim agreement 
interest income has fluctuated significantly each year and is anticipated to continue to fluctuate primarily due to changes in the levels of cash  investments and interest rates each period 
interest expense was  in   in  and  in in consideration of eitf d which was issued by the fasb in march  the company recorded  in imputed interest on million in convertible debentures due august   that were originally issued in september and were converted at a discount to market

will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily from private and public offerings of its equity securities 
cash provided from these offerings totaled approximately million through december   including net proceeds of million raised during at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million compared to million at december  the company will need substantial additional funds before it can expect to realize significant product revenue 
the company projects that at its current rate of spending and for its current activities  assuming consummation of the sale of jbl  its cash funds will enable the company to maintain its present operations into the first quarter of to the extent that the company is successful in accelerating its development of g or in expanding its development portfolio or acquiring or adding new development candidates  the current cash resources would be consumed at a greater rate 
similarly  the company had been seeking to identify and hire additional senior managers to direct the business of the company 
in this regard the company has hired a vice president of regulatory and clinical affairs  vice president of corporate development and a vice president and chief financial officer 
certain parties with whom the company has agreements have claimed default and  should the company be obligated to pay these claims or should the company engage legal services to defend or negotiate its positions or both  its ability to continue operations could be significantly reduced or shortened 
see md a certain trends and uncertainties claims of genta s default under various agreements 
the company anticipates that significant additional sources of financing  including equity financings  will be required in order for the company to continue its planned operations 
the company also anticipates seeking additional product development opportunities from external sources 
such acquisitions may consume cash reserves or require additional cash or equity 
the company s working capital and additional funding requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including i the progress of the company s research and development programs  ii the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  iii the level of resources that the company devotes to sales and marketing capabilities  iv technological advances  v the activities of competitors  and vi the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others to fund certain research and development efforts  to conduct clinical trials  to obtain regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  to manufacture and market products

see md a results of operations 
impact of year some older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue 
this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment of whether it would be necessary to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company has implemented a plan to acquire and install new computer hardware and upgraded software in its facilities that will accommodate dating beyond the total year project cost will not be material and subject to the company s receipt of adequate additional funds is expected to be completed not later than october   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
if through such communication or otherwise the company becomes aware of any such failures and is not satisfied that those failures are being adequately addressed  it will take appropriate steps to find alternative suppliers 
there is no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
it has been acknowledged by government authorities that year problems have the potential to disrupt global economies  that no business is immune from the potentially far reaching effects of the year problems  and that it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen after december  consequently  it is possible that year problems will have a material effect on the company s business even if the company takes all appropriate measures to ensure that it and its key suppliers are year compliant

subordination of common stock to series a and series d preferred stock  risk of dilution  anti dilution adjustments 
in the event of the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company  the common stock is expressly subordinate to the approximately million preference of the  outstanding shares of series a preferred stock and the approximately million preference of  shares of series d preferred stock including  shares of series d preferred stock issuable upon exercise of certain warrants 
dividends may not be paid on the common stock unless full cumulative dividends on the series a and series d preferred stocks have been paid or funds have been set aside  for such preferred dividends by the company 
the conversion rate of the series a preferred stock is subject to adjustment  among other things  upon certain issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock at per share or less 
as of april   each share of series a preferred stock is convertible into aproximately shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share 
on september   all outstanding series a warrants expired 
the conversion rate of the series d preferred stock and the exercise price of the series d warrants are subject to adjustment  among other things  upon certain issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock at prices per share below certain levels 
in addition  the conversion price of the series d preferred stock in effect on january  the reset date would have been adjusted and reset effective as of the reset date if the average closing bid price of the common stock for the consecutive trading days immediately preceding the reset date the month trading price were less than of the then applicable conversion price a reset event 
the trading price on the reset date was above the calculated amount based on the above formula  thereby eliminating the reset event 
accordingly  each share of series d preferred stock is presently convertible into approximately shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share of common stock  and the exercise price of the class d warrants is presently per share 
there are  class d warrants outstanding and another  class d warrants issuable upon the exercise of certain warrants 
an additional  class d warrants have been authorized and all were issued pursuant to a may  letter and subsequent acceptance by the series d holders 
finally  the company has outstanding bridge warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  line of credit warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  lbc warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at various exercise prices between approximately and per share and outstanding employee stock options 
the note and warrant purchase agreement provides that a number of additional bridge warrants penalty warrants equal to of the number of bridge warrants then held by the aries funds shall be issued to the aries funds for each day beyond days after the final closing of the private placement that a shelf registration statement covering the common stock underlying the securities purchased pursuant to the note and warrant purchase agreement is not filed with the sec and for each day beyond days after the closing date of the investment contemplated by the note and warrant purchase agreement that such shelf registration statement is not declared effective by the sec 
the company filed such shelf registration statement with the sec on september   but such shelf registration statement has not been declared effective by the sec 
as a result  the company could be obligated to issue penalty warrants to the aries funds 
the aries funds have not  to date  requested that the company issue such penalty warrants 
the company and the aries funds are currently conducting negotiations to determine whether  and to what extent  penalty warrants will be issued

early stage of development  technological uncertainty 
genta is at an early stage of development 
all of the company s potential therapeutic products are in research or development  and no revenues have been generated from therapeutic product sales 
to date  most of the company s resources have been dedicated to applying molecular biology and medicinal chemistry to the research and development of potential anticode tm pharmaceutical products based upon oligonucleotide technology 
while the company has demonstrated the activity of anticode tm oligonucleotide technology in model systems in vitro and the activity of antisense technology in animals and has identified compounds that the company believes are worthy of additional testing  only one of these potential anticode tm oligonucleotide products has begun to be tested in humans  with such testing in its early stages 
there can be no assurance that the novel approach of oligonucleotide technology will result in products that will receive necessary regulatory approvals or that will be successful commercially 
further  results obtained in pre clinical studies or early clinical investigations or pilot bioequivalence trials are not necessarily indicative of results that will be obtained in pivotal human clinical or bioequivalence trials 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s or genta jago s potential products can be successfully developed 
furthermore  the company s products in research or development may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their commercial use 
the company is pursuing research and development through genta jago of a range of oral controlled release formulations of currently available pharmaceuticals 
many of the products to be developed through genta jago have not yet been formulated using geomatrix r technology 
on july   skyepharma plc  the parent company to jago  announced that an anda for naproxen sodium filed by brightstone pharma  its us sales and marketing subsidiary  had been accepted for filing by the fda

limited availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
at december   the company has federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the difference between the federal and california tax loss carryforwards is primarily attributable to the capitalization of research and development expenses for california tax purposes and the fifty percent limitation on california loss carryforwards prior to the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized 
approximately million and million of the california tax loss carryforward expired during and  respectively and the related deferred tax asset and tax loss carryforward amounts have been reduced accordingly 
the remaining california tax loss will continue to expire in  unless utilized 
the company also has federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million respectively  which will begin expiring in  unless previously utilized 
federal and california tax laws limit the utilization of income tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards that arise prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation s ownership resulting in change of control of the company 
the future annual use of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits will be limited due to the ownership changes that occurred during     and because of the decrease in value of the company s stock  the ownership changes which occurred in  and will have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to utilize these carryforwards

no assurance of regulatory approval  government regulation 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial premarket approval requirements on the introduction of pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed pre clinical and clinical testing procedures and other costly and time consuming procedures 
satisfaction of these requirements  which includes demonstrating to the satisfaction of the fda and foreign regulatory agencies that the product is both safe and effective  typically takes several years or more depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product 
there can be no assurance that such testing will show any product to be safe or efficacious or  in the case of certain of genta jago s products  to be bioequivalent to a currently marketed pharmaceutical 
government regulation also affects the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the effect of government regulation may be to delay marketing of any new products for a considerable or indefinite period of time  to impose costly procedures upon the company s or genta jago s activities and to diminish any competitive advantage that the company or genta jago may have attained 
it may take years before marketing approvals are obtained for the company s or genta jago s products  if at all 
there can be no assurance that fda or other regulatory approval for any products developed by the company or genta jago will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or  if granted  that such approval will cover all the clinical indications for which the company or genta jago is seeking approval or will not sustain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use 
further  with respect to the reformulated versions of currently available pharmaceuticals being developed through genta jago  there is a substantial risk that the manufacturers or marketers of such currently available pharmaceuticals will seek to delay or block regulatory approval of any reformulated versions of such pharmaceuticals through litigation or other means 
any significant delay in obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals could materially adversely affect the company s or genta jago s revenue 
moreover  additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action may be established which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the company s or genta jago s products or further regulate the prices at which the company s or genta jago s proposed products may be sold 
the company is also subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations collectively governmental regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with the company s research and development work and manufacturing processes 
in october  jbl retained a chemical consulting firm to advise it with respect to an incident of soil and groundwater contamination the spill 
sampling conducted at the jbl facility revealed the presence of chloroform and perchloroethylenes pces in the soil and groundwater at this site 
six soil borings were drilled and groundwater wells were installed at several locations around the site 
the company believes that the costs associated with further investigation or remediation will not have a material adverse effect on the business of the company  although there can be no assurance thereof 
the company believes that it is in material compliance with governmental regulations  however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations in the future 
jbl received notice on october  from region ix of the environmental protection agency epa that it had been identified as a potentially responsible party prp at the casmalia disposal site  which is located in santa barbara  california

on this basis the company accrued  in the epa planned on sending by the beginning of january individual income calculations to each de minimis prp that received the aforementioned notice letter 
while the terms of the settlement have not been finalized  they should contain standard contribution release  and protection language 
uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary technology 
the company s and genta jago s success will depend  in part  on their respective abilities to obtain patents  maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
no assurance can be given that patents issued to or licensed by the company or genta jago will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or genta jago 
there can be no assurance that the company s or genta jago s patent applications will be approved  that the company or genta jago will develop additional products that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide the company or genta jago with any competitive advantage or adequate protection for its inventions or will not be challenged by others  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the ability of the company or genta jago to do business 
competitors may have filed applications  may have been issued patents or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes competitive with those of the company or genta jago 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate any of the company s or genta jago s products or design around any patented products developed by the company or genta jago 
the company and genta jago rely on secrecy to protect technology in addition to patent protection  especially where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable 
no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s or genta jago s trade secrets  or that the company or genta jago can effectively protect its rights to its unpatented trade secrets 
genta and genta jago have obtained licenses or other rights to patents and other proprietary rights of third parties  and may be required to obtain licenses to additional patents or other proprietary rights of third parties 
no assurance can be given that any existing licenses and other rights will remain in effect or that any licenses required under any such additional patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to the company or genta jago  if at all 
if genta s or genta jago s licenses and other rights are terminated or if genta or genta jago cannot obtain such additional licenses  genta or genta jago could encounter delays in product market introductions while it attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses could be foreclosed 
in addition  the company or genta jago could incur substantial costs  including costs caused by delays in obtaining regulatory approval and bringing products to market  in defending itself in any suits brought against the company or genta jago claiming infringement of the patent rights of third parties or in asserting the company s or genta jago s patent rights  including those granted by third parties  in a suit against another party 
the company or genta jago may also become involved in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office or any foreign counterpart in connection with one or more of its patents or patent applications  which could result in substantial cost to the company or genta jago  as well as an adverse decision as to priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved 
there can be no assurance that the company or genta jago will have sufficient funds to obtain  maintain or enforce patents on their respective products or technology  to obtain or maintain licenses that may be required in order to develop and commercialize their respective products  to contest patents obtained by third parties  or to defend against suits brought by third parties 
dependence on others 
the company s and genta jago s strategy for the research  development and commercialization of their products requires negotiating  entering into and maintaining various arrangements with corporate collaborators  licensors  licensees and others  and is dependent upon the subsequent success of these outside parties in performing their responsibilities 
no assurance can be given that they will obtain such collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all  nor can any assurance be given that any current collaborative arrangements will be maintained 
technology licensed from third parties 
the company has entered into certain agreements with  and licensed certain technology and compounds from  third parties 
the company has relied on scientific  technical  clinical  commercial and other data supplied and disclosed by others in entering into these agreements  including the genta jago agreements  and will rely on such data in support of development of certain products 
although the company has no reason to believe that this information contains errors of omission or fact  there can be no assurance that there are no errors of omission or fact that would materially affect the future approvability or commercial viability of these products 
potential adverse effect of technological change and competition 
the biotechnology industry is subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change 
the company and genta jago have numerous competitors in the united states and other countries for their respective technologies and products under development  including among others  major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that the company s or genta jago s competitors will not succeed in developing products or other novel technologies that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or genta jago or which would render the company s or genta jago s technology and products non competitive 
many of the company s and genta jago s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and human resources than the company or genta jago 
in addition  many of those competitors have significantly greater experience than the company or genta jago in undertaking pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products for use in healthcare 
accordingly  the company s or genta jago s competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for products more rapidly than the company or genta jago and such competitors may succeed in delaying or blocking regulatory approvals of the company s or genta jago s products 
as competitors of the company or of genta jago receive approval for products that share the same potential market as the company s or genta jago s potential products  the market share available to the company or genta jago will likely be reduced  thereby reducing the potential revenues and earnings available to the company or genta jago 
in addition  increased pricing competition would also likely result  further reducing the earnings potential of the company s or genta jago s products 
the company is aware that certain competitors of genta jago have filed  and received approval of  an anda for a generic formulation of drugs of which genta jago was working to develop generic formulations 
furthermore  if the company or genta jago is permitted to commence commercial sales of products  it will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities  an area in which it has limited or no experience  and manufacturing efficiency 
there are many public and private companies that are conducting research and development activities based on drug delivery or antisense technologies 
the company believes that the industry wide interest in such technologies will accelerate and competition will intensify as the techniques which permit drug design and development based on such technologies are more widely understood 
uncertainty of clinical trials and results 
the results of clinical trials and pre clinical testing are subject to varying interpretations 
even if the development of the company s or genta jago s respective products advances to the clinical stage  there can be no assurance that such products will prove to be safe and effective 
the products that are successfully developed  if any  will be subject to requisite regulatory approval prior to their commercial sale  and the approval  if obtainable  may take several years 
generally  only a very small percentage of the number of new pharmaceutical products initially developed is approved for sale 
even if products are approved for sale  there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful 
the company or genta jago may encounter unanticipated problems relating to development  manufacturing  distribution and marketing  some of which may be beyond the company s or genta jago s respective financial and technical capacity to solve 
the failure to address such problems adequately could have a material adverse effect on the company s or genta jago s respective businesses  financial conditions  prospects and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that the company or genta jago will succeed in the development and marketing of any new drug products  or that they will not be rendered obsolete by products of competitors 
see md a certain trends and uncertainties potential adverse effect of technological change and competition 
difficult manufacturing process  access to certain raw materials 
the manufacture of anticode tm oligonucleotides is a time consuming and complex process 
management believes that the company has the ability to acquire or produce quantities of oligonucleotides sufficient to support its present needs for research and its projected needs for its initial clinical development programs 
however  in order to obtain oligonucleotides sufficient to meet the volume and cost requirements needed for certain commercial applications of anticode tm oligonucleotide products  genta requires raw materials currently provided by a single supplier which is itself a development stage biotechnology company and a competitor of the company and is subject to uncertainties including the potential for a decision by such supplier to discontinue production of such raw materials  the insolvency of such supplier  or the failure of such supplier to follow applicable regulatory guidelines 
products based on chemically modified oligonucleotides have never been manufactured on a commercial scale 
the manufacture of all of the company s and genta jago s products will be subject to current gmp requirements prescribed by the fda or other standards prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agency in the country of use 
there can be no assurance that the company or genta jago will be able to manufacture products  or have products manufactured for it  in a timely fashion at acceptable quality and prices  that they or third party manufacturers can comply with gmp or that they or third party manufacturers will be able to manufacture an adequate supply of product 
failure to establish compliance with gmp to the satisfaction of the fda can result in delays in  or prohibition from  initiating clinical trials or commercial marketing of a product 
limited sales  marketing and distribution experience 
the company and genta jago have very limited experience in pharmaceutical sales  marketing and distribution 
in order to market and sell certain products directly  the company or genta jago would have to develop or subcontract a sales force and a marketing group with technical expertise 
there can be no assurance that any direct sales or marketing efforts would be successful 
uncertainty of product pricing  reimbursement and related matters 
the company s and genta jago s business may be materially adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets the pricing or profitability of healthcare products is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control 
while the company cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals or reforms will be adopted  the adoption of any such proposal or reform could adversely affect the commercial viability of the company s and genta jago s potential products 
in addition  in both the united states and elsewhere  sales of healthcare products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services  and therefore significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement of existing and newly approved healthcare products 
if the company or genta jago succeeds in bringing one or more products to market  there can be no assurance that these products will be considered cost effective and that reimbursement to the consumer will be available or will be sufficient to allow the company or genta jago to sell its products on a competitive basis 
finally  given the above potential market constraints on pricing  the availability of competitive products in these markets may further limit the company s and genta jago s flexibility in pricing and in obtaining adequate reimbursement for its potential products 
see md a certain trends and uncertainties potential adverse effect of technological change and competition 
need for and dependence on qualified personnel 
the company s success is highly dependent on the hiring and retention of key personnel and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional personnel or both is likely further to impede the achievement of development objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of the company s activities  and there can be no assurance that genta will be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company has hired a vice president and chief financial officer  a vice president of corporate development and a vice president of clinical and regulatory affairs 
product liability exposure  limited insurance coverage 
the company s  jbl s and genta jago s businesses expose them to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of human therapeutic products 
the company has also obtained a level of liability insurance coverage that it deems appropriate for its current stage of development 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s present insurance coverage is adequate 
such existing coverage may not be adequate as the company further develops products  and no assurance can be given that  in the future  adequate insurance coverage will be available in sufficient amounts or at a reasonable cost  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
fundamental change 
in  the board of directors of the company and certain holders of common stock and series a and series d preferred stock approved  in accordance with delaware law  an amendment to the restated certificate of incorporation to remove the fundamental change redemption right 
the company recently distributed to its stockholder s an information statement on form c describing this stockholder action and expects formally to amend the restated certificate of incorporation after the expiration of the day period provided for in rule c promulgated under the exchange act 
the company s restated certificate of incorporation currently provides that upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  the holders of series a preferred stock have the option of requiring the company to repurchase all of each such holder s shares of series a preferred stock at the redemption price  an event that could result in the company being required to pay to the holders of series a preferred stock stock or in certain circumstances cash in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
furthermore  if the company is required to redeem the series a preferred stock  it would also be required subject to certain conditions to offer to redeem the series d preferred stock  on a pari passu basis with the series a preferred stock and with the same type of consideration paid in redemption of the series a preferred stock 
upon a fundamental change  the company could  under certain circumstances  be required to pay the holders of series d preferred stock cash in the aggregate amount of approximately million not including an additional million that could be payable upon redemption of  shares of series d preferred stock issuable upon exercise of certain warrants 
fundamental change is defined as i a person or group as defined  together with any affiliates thereof  becoming the beneficial owner as defined of voting shares as defined of the company entitled to exercise more than of the total voting power of all outstanding voting shares of the company including any voting shares that are not then outstanding of which such person or group is deemed the beneficial owner subject to certain exceptions  ii any consolidation of the company with  or merger of the company into  any other person  any merger of another person into the company  or any sale  lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company to another person subject to certain exceptions  iii the sale  transfer or other disposition or the entry into a commitment to sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the shares of genta jago held at any time by the company or the imposition of any material lien on such shares which lien is not removed within days of imposition and the sale or functional equivalent of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of genta jago  or iv the substantial reduction or elimination of a public market for the common stock as the result of repurchases  delisting or deregistration of the common stock or corporate reorganization or recapitalization undertaken by the company 
hazardous materials  environmental matters 
the company s research and development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials  biological hazardous materials and radioactive compounds 
the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
although the company believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by such laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  the company may be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed the resources of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  nor that the operations  business or assets of the company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations
