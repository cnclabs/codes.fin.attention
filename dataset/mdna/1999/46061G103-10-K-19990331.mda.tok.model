liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   the company s cash used in operations was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operations primarily resulted from lower working capital requirements in offsetting increased operating losses 
the company expects to continue to have operating cash flow deficiencies for the near future as it develops and expands its business 
for the year ended december   the company used million in investing activities whereas million were provided from investing activities for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to increased capital expenditures in and the company not receiving proceeds from the maturity of investment securities in as it did in cash provided by financing activities increased in compared to as a result of increased proceeds from the sale of the company s preferred stock  common stock and common stock warrants 
in  the company received million in net proceeds from the sale of these stock instruments whereas only million was received in since its inception  the company has funded its operations and working capital needs primarily through the public and private placement of the company s equity securities

there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
should the company be unsuccessful in its efforts to raise capital it may be required to modify or curtail its plans for growth 
year issues rocky mountain internet is preparing its systems and applications for the year various problems may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date 
if the computer systems cannot distinguish between the year and  system failures or other computer errors could result 
state of readiness the company has established a yk committee to coordinate appropriate activity and a reporting structure to the board of directors on a monthly basis with regard to the year issue 
this committee has outlined a comprehensive plan and is currently implementing the tasks associated for the company to become yk ready 
preliminary indications are that  since rocky mountain internet is a relatively new company founded in  most hardware and software systems  as well as software programs used by the company  will not be impacted by the year issues 
all of the company s mis user equipment is based on microsoft windows   or nt 
microsoft has issued or is issuing patches that will make this software compliant by year end 
internal mis systems that handle accounting and customer care are being replaced due to growth needs 
all future software that will be purchased will be yk compliant 
all internally written software is currently being checked to ensure yk compliance and will be completed no later than october users have been briefed on the necessity for them to check any special  non mission critical software that they have purchased for their departments to ensure that it is yk compliant 
the company has inventoried the externally purchased network elements including routers  router software  router redundancy options  processor cards  and switches 
the company has verified completion of testing  in cooperation with the external vendors  that the products associated with the network elements are yk compliant 
after testing and certification  the company learned that of the network elements passed the yk compliance test  while failed 
of the of elements that failed  and therefore were not yk compliant  the company has upgraded all but one piece of equipment to be year compliant 
the remaining piece will be replaced no later than october rocky mountain internet has acquired eight companies since june we are currently working very closely with each company to determine their state of readiness 
overall  the companies are approximately yk compliant from a hardware and software perspective 
the company believes that the remaining non compliance is a result primarily of not yet being able to complete testing of those components 
with respect to communications from external third parties requesting that the company provide verification of yk compliance on the company s goods and services  the company expects to have formal response letters sent no later than may  with respect to communications from the company to external third party vendors that provide additional goods and services to the company  we expect to issue requests to all those parties to provide verification of yk compliance on their goods and services no later than may  subsequent testing will indicate what modifications or replacements will be necessary for the company to be internally year ready 
the company is currently evaluating the financial impact for yk compliance and expects that total costs will not exceed  to  the estimates for the costs of the year program are based upon management s best estimates and may be updated or revised as additional information becomes available 
the company has incurred approximately  thus far on administrative costs in connection with assessing the year issues 
due to the company s headquarters and data center move during the first quarter of  the company estimates no more than  was spent for not only the data center move but also to ensure non yk compliant equipment was replaced with equipment that met yk standards 
the company is assessing whether or not they will hire an external consultant to assess the state of readiness of all systems which could be affected by the year issue 
the company believes such costs will not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
risk assessment the failure by the company to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
presently  however  the company perceives that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario related to the year is associated with potential concerns with third party services or products 
the company is dependent on a significant number of third party vendors to provide both network services or equipment 
a significant year related disruption of the network services or equipment provided to the company by third party vendors could cause customers to consider seeking alternate providers or cause an unmanageable burden on customer service and technical support  which in turn could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
although the company believes that internal yk compliance will be achieved by december   there can be no assurance that the yk problem will not have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations as a result of third party failures 
contingency plans due to the current phase in which the company is in of its year analysis  the company is currently unable at this time to fully assess its risk and determine what contingency plans  if any  need to be implemented by the company 
the company s primary concern  at this point  is with its third party communications providers 
these service providers are conducting their own assessments of their year readiness 
the company expects that these third party vendors will be year ready 
however  any failure by third party vendors to resolve any year issues on a timely basis or in a manner that is compatible with the company s systems could have a material adverse effect on the company 
preliminary indications are  however  that the company s third party providers are  or will be  year compliant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not have any derivative financial instruments as of december  the company s interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents 
the company s long term debt has fixed interest rates and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  the company generally enters into fixed rate investing and borrowing arrangements 
as a result  the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material
