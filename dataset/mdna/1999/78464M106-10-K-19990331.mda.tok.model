srs currently operates in two business segments a the development and marketing of technology in the forms of integrated circuits designed and distributed through valence and the licensing of technologies developed by the company to oems and semiconductor manufacturers and b the sale of consumer electronic products and components 
a summary of the company s operations and activities by business segment and geographic area is set forth below 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and percentage of total revenue years ended december  chip and licensing revenue product and component sales total revenue cost of sales gross margin sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expense operating income loss other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues chip and licensing revenue consists of design fees and sales of custom application specific integrated circuits asics by valence to oem manufacturers and sales of general purpose ics designed by the company under the brand name asp microelectronics 
licensing revenues are royalties generated primarily from the license of the company s audio technologies 
license and royalty agreements generally provide for the license of technologies for a specified period of time for either a single fee or a fee based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
product and component sales represent a the manufacture and sale of valence s own branded product line of vcd players  amplifiers and game products and b the distribution of semiconductor products  manufacturing components and sub assemblies to oems for the hong kong and china markets 
total revenues for fiscal were  which includes revenues generated by valence since february  this contrasts with fiscal where revenues were  and were generated solely from licensing activities 
excluding chip design revenue  licensing revenue decreased from the same period last year due to the following factors a the shift in the pc market to lower cost models  which cannot bear the cost of performance enhancement technologies such as those offered by srs labs  b the asian financial crisis which reduced demand for consumer electronics products in the region and negatively impacted the sales of semiconductor ics that include the company s audio technologies  and c the trend by consumer electronic manufacturers to adopt the company s technologies into their higher end models has limited volume growth of models using the company s licensed audio technologies 
the licensing revenue decrease was offset by the custom asic chip design and chip sales of  related to valence s activities 
revenue generated from product and component sales is attributable to valence and therefore is not comparable to last year 
revenues in future quarters are expected to consist primarily of asic design and product and electronic component sales 
gross margin cost of sales for fiscal consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
cost of sales for fiscal consisted primarily of fees paid to third party representatives for sales administration and support 
gross margin for the twelve months ended december  decreased to from for the same period in the decrease resulted from the shift in the company s revenue base towards product and electronic component sales  which have significantly lower margins than the company s historic licensing revenue base 
gross margins in future quarters will primarily reflect the cost of manufacturing products for sale as opposed to licensing transactions which typically have higher gross margins 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions and product promotion 
sales and marketing expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of which was attributable to the valence acquisition and an increase in domestic staffing to promote new technologies 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  as a result of the higher revenue base 
research and development research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs for engineering materials and supplies 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  primarily attributable to the valence acquisition 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  as a result of the higher revenue base 
management believes research and development expenses will increase in the future as a result of the company s continual product development efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  legal costs associated with the administration of intellectual property and other professional fees

as part of the valence acquisition  the company allocated a portion of the purchase price to various intangible assets totaling approximately  this amount was capitalized and is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to eleven years with the related amortization expense of  included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the purchase price allocation associated with the valence acquisition 
acquired in process research and development the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes the one time charge of  for the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses associated with the valence acquisition and the acquisition of certain assets associated with the vip technology 
the in process research and development expenses arose from new product projects that were under development at the date of the acquisition and expected to eventually lead to new products but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
the valuation of the in process research and development projects was based upon the discounted expected future net cash flows of the products over the products expected lives  reflecting the estimated stages of completion of the projects and the estimated costs to complete the projects 
new product development projects underway at valence at the time of the valence acquisition included  among others  asics for consumer electronics  computing and voice and audio applications  home entertainment systems  digital multimedia players and digital power amplifiers 
the company estimated that these projects were approximately complete at the date of acquisition and estimated that the cost to complete these projects will aggregate approximately million and will be incurred over a three year period 
new product development projects utilizing the vip technology at the time of the vip acquisition included  among others  digital and analog sound reinforcement  wireless and non wireless telecommunications applications  hearing aid applications  headphone and microphone applications 
the company estimated that these projects were approximately complete at the date of acquisition and estimated that the cost to complete these projects will aggregate approximately  and will be incurred over a two year period 
uncertainties that could impede the progress of converting a development project to a developed technology include the availability of financial resources to complete the project  failure of the technology to function properly  continued economic feasibility of developed technologies  customer acceptance  customer demand and customer qualification of such new technology and general competitive conditions in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the acquired in process research and development projects will be successfully completed and commercially introduced 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense  realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
net interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average cash and investment balances during the current year as compared to the prior year due to the  paid in conjunction with the acquisitions of valence and vip and interest expense on the outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit obtained during fiscal the company also recognized  of realized gains on the sale of investments available for sale and a foreign exchange transaction loss related to the valence operations of  in fiscal provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was  compared to income tax expense of  for fiscal the company recognized a tax benefit in fiscal primarily due to a taxable loss recognized for us federal income tax purposes related to domestic operations 
in addition  the company benefited from certain tax credits and statutory tax rates in the asian countries where valence has its principal business operations which are lower than united states statutory rates

year readiness disclosure the company is currently in the process of addressing a problem that is facing all users of automated information systems 
the year issue arises out of the fact that many of the world s computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions in the us and internationally 
the company and its subsidiaries have identified the following areas which could be impacted by the year issue 
they are company products  internally used systems and software  products or services provided by key third parties  and the inability of chip partners  licensees or customers to process business transactions relating to chip design and licensing revenue and product and component sales 
during fiscal  the company and its subsidiaries reviewed its internal systems including those which support manufacturing process control and financial and general business operations 
the review consisted of an evaluation of significant internal hardware systems and major software application programs for their ability to accurately recognize and process dates properly in the year and beyond 
as a result of this evaluation  the company has identified certain systems which require upgrades to be year ready  including certain business software applications 
the company is in the process of installing a new computer system in its overseas operation and has been assured by the software and hardware providers that these systems will be fully compliant with the year the company s products do not have any material year problems 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are in the process of assessing the compliance of their major customers  suppliers and vendors 
management believes that third party relationships upon which the company relies represent the greatest risk with respect to the year issue  because the company cannot guarantee that third parties will be able to adequately assess and address their year compliance issues in a timely manner 
as a consequence  the company can give no assurances that issues related to year would not have a material adverse effect on future results of operations or financial condition 
total costs relating to the company s compliance efforts  based on management s best estimates  were previously estimated to be as high as  however  based upon more current facts  the company has revised its cost estimate range to be as high as  should the company not be completely successful in mitigating internal and external year risks  the likely worst case scenario could be a system failure causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  manufacture products  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities at the company or its vendors and suppliers 
the company currently does not have a contingency plan with respect to potential year failures of its suppliers or customers and at the present time does not intend to develop one 
if these failures would occur  depending upon their duration and severity  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the information set forth above under this caption year readiness disclosure relates to the company s efforts to address the year concerns regarding the company s a operations  b products and technologies licensed or sold to third parties and c major suppliers and customers 
such statements are intended as year statements and year readiness disclosures and are subject to the year information readiness act

forward looking information and certain factors included in part i  item business  this item and elsewhere in this report are certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  reflecting management s current expectations 
examples of such forward looking statements include the expectations of the company with respect to its strategy 
although the company believes that its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions  there can be no assurances that the company s financial goals will be realized 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
numerous factors may affect the company s actual results and may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
such factors include  among others  those set forth below 
the company assumes no obligation to update the forward looking information to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting such forward looking information 
quarterly fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate from those in prior quarters and will continue to be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the extent to which the company s licensees incorporate the company s technologies into their products  the timing of orders from and the shipments to major customers  the timing of new product introductions by the company  the gain or loss of significant customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s technologies  the rate that the company s semiconductor licensees manufacture and distribute chips to original equipment manufacturers oems  and fluctuations in general economic conditions  particularly those affecting the consumer electronics market 
due to the company s dependence on the consumer electronics market  the substantial seasonality of sales in the market could impact the company s revenues and net income 
in particular  the company believes that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season as well as the chinese new year within the asia region  which fall into the fourth and first quarters  respectively 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
changes to the business model integration of valence refinement of asian strategy from the company s inception in to  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from licensing activities 
as a result of the acquisition of valence  the company has added business operations engaged in the design and sale of asics and other semiconductor products  the design  manufacture and sale of consumer electronics products  and the distribution of components and products within mainland china and throughout asia 
these operations differ substantially from the company s previous business model  and future operating results could be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products distributed and the mix of distribution channels employed  the emergence of new industry standards  product obsolescence and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers 
the integration of certain operations following the valence acquisition has required  and will continue to require  the dedication of management and other personnel resources which may temporarily distract them from the day to day business of the combined company 
the geographic separation of these operations is likely to place additional strain on the company s resources 
in addition  the company s significant operations in china and asia have required refinement to adapt to the changing market conditions in that region 
this refinement may impact certain of the company s current business directions  including valence  as the company attempts to position itself to maximize penetration of selected growth segments in that region 
the company s operations in asia  and internationally in general  also are subject to risks of unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements 
the acquisition of valence has added significant diversity to the company s overall business structure and the company s opportunities 
the company recognizes that in the presence of such corporate diversity  and in particular with regard to the semiconductor industry  there will always exist a potential for a conflict among sales channels between the company and certain of the company s technology licensees 
although the operations of the company s licensing business and those of valence are generally complementary  there can be no assurances that sales channel conflicts will not arise 
if such potential conflicts do materialize  the company may or may not be able to mitigate the effect of such perceived conflicts  which  if not resolved  may impact the results of operations 
currency risk stability of asian markets the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
to date  all of the company s licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
it is the company s expectation that licensing revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
with its acquisition of valence and the company s anticipated expansion of its business in china and other parts of asia  the company s consolidated operations and financial results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold 
in addition  the company s valuation of assets recorded as a result of the valence acquisition may also be adversely impacted by the currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
the company intends to actively monitor its foreign exchange exposure and to implement strategies to reduce its foreign exchange risk at such time that the company determines the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
however  there is no guarantee that the company will take steps to insure against such risks  and should such risks occur  there is no guarantee that the company will not be significantly impacted 
countries in the asia pacific region have recently experienced weakness in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for valence s products  the us dollar value of the company s and its subsidiaries foreign currency denominated sales  the availability and supply of product components to valence and ultimately  the company s consolidated results of operations 
competitive pressures the company s existing and potential competitors include both large and emerging domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
the company s present or future competitors may be able to develop products and technologies comparable or superior to those offered by the company  and to adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving market needs 
the company believes that the competitive factors affecting the market for the company s products and technologies include product performance  price and quality  product functionality and features  the ease of integration and implementation of the products and technologies with other hardware and software components in the oem s products 
in addition  the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  declining average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in its respective markets  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
importance of intellectual property the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company has filed several us and foreign patent applications and to date has a number of issued us and foreign patents covering various aspects of its technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other property rights 
the company is not currently a party to any claims of this nature 
there can be no assurances that third parties will not assert additional claims or initiate litigation against the company or its customers with respect to existing or future products 
in addition  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of the company or others 
management of growth  dependence on key personnel the company has recently experienced rapid growth and expansion with the acquisition of valence 
this acquisition has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its administrative  operational and financial resources  and has increased  and will continue to increase  the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel 
the company anticipates that any future growth will require it to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering  operations  finance  sales and marketing 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can retain and recruit necessary personnel to operate its business and support future growth 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully also will require the company to continue to expand and improve its administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
volatility of stock price the trading price of the common stock has been  and will likely continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in the company s operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  general market fluctuations and other events and factors 
changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which the company does business  or relating to the company specifically  have in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
acquisitions from time to time  the company expects to make acquisitions of businesses or technologies that are complementary to its business strategy 
such future acquisitions would expose the company to risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among others  difficulty of assimilating the operations  information systems and personnel of the acquired businesses  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  and the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through successful incorporation of the acquired technologies  employees and customers 
there can be no assurance that any potential acquisition will be consummated or  if consummated  that it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquired in process research and development uncertainties that could impede the progress of converting a development project to a developed technology include the availability of financial resources to complete the project  failure of the technology to function properly  continued economic feasibility of developed technologies  customer acceptance  customer demand and customer qualification of such new technology and general competitive conditions in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the acquired in process research and development projects associated with the acquisitions of valence and vip will be successfully completed and commercially introduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of its debt 
foreign currency the company has subsidiary operations in hong kong and china  and accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses the local currency hong kong dollars as the functional currency for its subsidiaries 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars were nil in fiscal due to the fact that the value of the hong kong dollar is currently pegged to the us dollar  and the exchange rate remained constant throughout the year 
under the current circumstances  the company believes that the foreign currency market risk is not material 
the company actively monitors its foreign exchange exposure and  should circumstances change  intends to implement strategies to reduce its risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
there can be no assurance that management s efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will be successful 
interest rates the company s line of credit bears interest based on the lending bank s prime rate or libor 
the interest rate on the balance of million outstanding at december  was 
the company believes that if interest rates were to increase by as much as  the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements would not be material
