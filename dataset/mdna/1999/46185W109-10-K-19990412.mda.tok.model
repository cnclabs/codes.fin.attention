item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the company was formed in to engage in the business of reselling computer hardware and software products and providing related services 
to date  most of its revenue has been derived from sales of computer products and related services 
the company operated from a single office in houston  texas until when it opened a branch office in dallas  texas 
in  the company began offering telecom systems in its houston office 
in  the company acquired and began marketing certain computer telephony software products 
during the company opened offices in austin  mcallen and el paso  texas  and during opened additional offices in albuquerque and las cruces  new mexico  and san antonio  texas 
in addition  the company employs sales representatives who work from their homes in florida  missouri  nebraska and oklahoma 
effective for the year ended december   the company will begin segment reporting as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb three segments will be reported  with results detailed down to the earnings before interest and taxes line 
the three segments are information technology  telecom systems and cti software 
the results for the new information technology segment are the combined computer products and it services business units for which revenue and gross profit have been reported during past reporting periods 
the gross margin varies substantially between each of these business segments 
over the past three years the gross margin in information technology has ranged between and  the gross margin in telecom systems has ranged between and  and the gross margin for cti software has ranged between to 
information technology  telecom systems and cti software accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively  during in order to reduce freight costs and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with product handling  the company began in to drop ship a higher percentage of orders directly from its suppliers to its customers 
this initiative has resulted in the percentage of drop shipped orders measured as the cost of goods drop shipped as a percentage of total cost of goods sold growing from in  to in while the company does not believe that it is in its best interest to drop ship all orders  it does intend to increase the volume of drop shipments with the expectation of reducing its freight  distribution and administrative costs related to these revenues 
a significant portion of the company s selling  general and administrative expenses relate to personnel costs  some of which are variable and others of which are relatively fixed 
the company s variable personnel costs are substantially comprised of sales commissions  which are typically calculated based upon the company s gross profit on a particular sales transaction and thus generally fluctuate with the company s overall gross profit 
the remainder of the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are relatively more fixed and  while still somewhat variable  do not vary with increases in revenue as directly as do sales commissions 
manufacturers of many of the computer products resold by the company have consistently reduced unit prices near the end of a product s life cycle  most frequently following the introduction of newer  more advanced models 
while some manufacturers of products sold by the company offer to price protect the inventory carried by the company for a certain length of time following a price decrease by the manufacturer  recently many manufacturers have moved to more restrictive price protection policies or have largely eliminated price protection 
additionally  manufacturers have developed specialized marketing programs designed to improve or protect the manufacturer s market share 
these programs often involve the granting of rebates to resellers to subsidize sales of computer products at reduced prices 
while these programs generally enhance revenues they also generally result in lower margins being realized by the reseller 
the company has participated in an increasing number of these programs in recent years 
based upon recent trends  the company believes that the number and amount of these programs will increase 
inacom corp 
inacom is the largest supplier of products sold by the company 
purchases from inacom accounted for approximately   and of the company s total product purchases in  and  respectively 
in august  the company renewed its long term supply arrangement with inacom and agreed to purchase at least of its products from inacom  but only to the extent that such products were available through inacom and made available within a reasonable period of time at reasonably competitive pricing 
inacom does not carry certain product lines sold by the company and inacom may be unable to offer reasonable product availability and reasonably competitive pricing from time to time on those product lines that it carries 
the company thus expects that less than of its total purchases  as in past years  will be made from inacom 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from the company s consolidated statements of operations and indicates the percentage of total revenue for each item

total revenue increased  to  in from  in revenue from information technology  which comprised of total revenue in compared to in  increased  to  in from  in the increase in information technology revenue was generally attributable to increased sales of products and services to new and existing customers and to sales generated in the company s newer branch offices 
of the  increase in information technology revenue   resulted from increased sales in the company s more established offices in houston and dallas and  resulted from sales in the company s newer offices opened since mid the increase of  from the older  more established offices in houston and dallas represented an increase of to  in from  in the increase of  from the company s newer branch offices represented an increase of to  in from  in total information technology revenue consisted of  of total information technology revenue from product sales and  of total from services as compared to  of total and  of total  respectively  in information technology revenue from product sales increased and revenue from services increased during compared to revenue from telecom systems  which comprised of total revenue in  compared to in  increased  to  in from  in the increase in telecom systems revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of systems to new and existing customers and due to sales of larger systems 
telecom systems operates primarily out of the company s houston office and  therefore  has insignificant revenues attributable to sales from the company s other offices 
revenue from cti software  which comprised of total revenue in  compared to in  increased to  in from  in the increased revenues from cti software were primarily the result of sales to new customers  the introduction of a new call center software product  the addition of several new resellers for their products and the integration of products with several third party software products 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  to  in from  in  while gross margin decreased to in from in gross profit and gross margin were affected by asset valuation markdowns of  in the company s information technology segment related to reducing the carrying value of that segment s inventory and certain vendor accounts receivables 
the company decided that the mark downs in inventory value were necessary based upon an analysis of the impact of supplier s changes in product return privileges and price protection policies made available by product manufacturers and suppliers 
the markdowns related to reducing the carrying value of certain vendor accounts receivables were due to the company s inability to collect certain accounts related to special promotional funds owed to the company from certain of its suppliers 
the gross margin for information technology decreased to in from in  reflecting the effect of the aforementioned asset valuation markdowns and lower gross margin produced on the services revenue component of total information technology revenues 
the gross margin for telecom systems increased to in from in this improvement in gross margin was primarily due to an increase to a more normal gross margin from the year earlier period when gross margin was lower than expected due to a number of circumstances  including the fact that the period contained a number of larger  lower margin sales 
the gross margin for cti software increased to in from in this increase was due primarily to lower system installation costs  relative to revenue  reflecting improved productivity and efficiency due to improved software installation and customization tools introduced in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  in from  in as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the dollar increase of approximately  was attributable to a increase in sales personnel compensation due to the company s efforts to expand its sales force  particularly in the newer branch offices  and to increased commissions paid to sales staff resulting from increases in revenue  approximately  was attributable to a increase in compensation to administrative personnel primarily related to the opening of additional offices  and was attributable to a increase in rent  utilities and telephone expenses primarily related to the company operating eight physical branch offices and a regional distribution facility at the end of the period compared to only three branch offices at the end of other costs were generally higher in compared to due to the company opening and operating the additional branch offices and the distribution center and due to increased levels of business activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses in information technology increased  to  in compared to  in for telecom systems  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in for cti software  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  from  in operating income loss 
operating income decreased  to a loss of  in from a profit of  in due primarily to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and the effect of the aforementioned asset valuation markdowns 
operating income in information technology decreased  to a loss of in from operating income of  in for telecom systems  the operating loss decreased to in from in for cti software  the operating loss increased to in from in interest expense net of other income 
interest expense net of other income decreased to in compared to in interest expense decreased in due to the reduction of outstanding debt resulting from the stock offering proceeds applied to the reduction of debt 
net income loss 
net income loss  after an income tax benefit totaling reflecting an effective tax rate of for compared to for  became a loss of  in compared to a profit of  in year ended december  compared to the year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue 
total revenue increased  to  in from  in revenue from information technology  which comprised of total revenue  increased  to  in from  in the increase in information technology revenue was generally attributable to increased sales to new and existing customers 
revenue in information technology did not grow as expected in principally due to insufficient capital resources during the first half of and the inability of the newly added sales personnel to attain the level of revenue production normally expected of new personnel 
revenue from telecom systems  which comprised of total revenue  increased  to  in from  in the increase in telecom systems revenue was primarily the result of adding new customers  of which one customer accounted for approximately  of the increase 
revenue from cti software increased to  in from  in the increased revenues were primarily the result of sales to new customers 
gross profit 
gross profit increased  to  in from  in gross margin increased to in from in the gross margin for information technology increased to in from in the gross margin for telecom systems decreased to in from in in  telecom systems bid on and won the installation of several large systems 
as a result of the competitive bidding process employed by certain customers these large systems were projects that had lower than normal margins 
in addition  gross margin decreased in due to the purchase of a large system by a single customer at a lower than usual margin 
cti software gross margin increased to in  from in this increase in cti software gross margin reflected slightly lower  installation costs and development costs as a percentage of revenue in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  in from  in as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in of the dollar increase  approximately  was attributable to increased temporary and permanent personnel  principally in non sales personnel 
other costs that grew at a rate in excess of the rate of growth in revenues include expenses relating to becoming and being a publicly held corporation and professional fees 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily from increased expenditures for those expenses that do not fluctuate with gross profit or revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense in information technology increased to  in compared to  in for telecom systems  selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in from  in for cti software  selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in from in operating income 
operating income decreased to  in from  in operating income as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in largely due to increases in selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income in information technology business segment increased to  in from  in for telecom systems  operating income decreased to an operating loss of in compared to operating income of in for cti software  the operating loss decreased to in from in interest expense net of other income 
interest expense net of other income decreased to in from  in interest expense decreased due primarily to the reduction of outstanding debt by applying the proceeds of the company s initial public offering to the reduction of debt

the company s quarterly results may vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of large customer orders  timing of new product introductions  adequacy of product supply  variations in the company s product costs  variations in the company s product mix  promotions by the company  seasonal influences and competitive pricing pressures 
furthermore  the company generally experiences a higher volume of product orders in its information technology business segment in the fourth quarter  which the company attributes to year end capital spending by some of its customers 
any decrease in the number of year end orders experienced by the company may not be offset by increased revenues in the company s first three quarters

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has satisfied its cash requirements principally through borrowings under its lines of credit and through operations 
the company maintains a cash position sufficient to pay only its immediately due obligations and expenses 
when the amount of cash available falls below its immediate needs the company requests an advance under its credit facility 
as the company s total revenue has grown  the company has obtained increases in its available lines of credit to enable it to finance its growth 
the company s working capital was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the increase in working capital during was attributable to the receipt of net proceeds from a public offering of the company s common stock in july and net earnings 
the decrease in working capital during was primarily attributable to the net operating loss and capital expenditures 
at december   the company had total borrowing capacity under its credit facility of approximately  as compared to  at december  at december  the company had outstanding borrowings of  and  thus  was fully borrowed against its credit facility based upon its collateral base at that time 
at december   the company had a  credit facility with its primary lender  which was increased on a temporary basis to  to accommodate an increased level of business 
the company is seeking a permanent increase in its credit facility to support a higher level of business 
as of december   the company was fully borrowed against its available borrowing based due to the higher level of business during the fourth quarter 
the company expects an increased level of business in and to support an increased level of business over the fourth quarter  the company will be required to increase its borrowing base relative to the borrowing base as of december  the company expects to accomplish this requirement by improved asset management 
if the company does not increase its borrowing base it will not be able to significantly increase its level of revenue over that which was realized in the fourth quarter 
cash flows operating activities provided net cash totaling and  during and  respectively  and used net cash totaling  during net cash provided during  was due primarily to the combined effect of significantly increased net income  a relatively small year to year increase in accounts receivable and a year to year decrease in inventory 
during  net cash was provided from operations due primarily to net income  increased levels of trade accounts payable and accrued expenses which more than offset increases in accounts receivable 
during  net cash was used by operations due primarily to a net loss  a large increase in accounts receivable  an increase in inventory  which was offset somewhat by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable increased   and  during  and  respectively 
inventory decreased and in and  respectively  and increased  in investing activities used cash totaling  and  during  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities that used cash during these periods were primarily related to capital expenditures related to new offices  an expanded work force and upgrading of computing equipment and the company s management information systems 
during the next twelve months  the company expects to incur an estimated for capital expenditures 
all or a portion of the in capital expenditures currently anticipated by the company for such purposes are presently expected to be financed from net cash flow from operations or borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures may vary substantially depending upon  among other things  the performance of certain of the company s recently opened branch offices 
financing activities provided cash totaling  and  during  and  respectively 
in july  the company received  net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a public offering 
those proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding balance under the company s line of credit 
the primary source of cash from financing activities in other periods has been borrowings on the company s lines of credit 
the lines of credit have been used principally to satisfy the company s cash requirements  including financing increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
during  the company used to repurchase shares that were held in treasury at the end of asset management the company s cash flow from operations has been affected primarily by the timing of its collection of accounts receivable 
the company typically sells its products and services on short term credit terms and seeks to minimize its credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting its own collection efforts 
the company had accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  of   and  at december   and  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in trade accounts receivable was days  days and days for years  and  respectively 
the increase in days sales outstanding was caused by a general slow down in payments by the company s customers 
bad debt expense as a percentage of total revenue for the same periods was  and 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of accounts receivable  was  and at december   and  respectively 
the company attempts to manage its inventory in order to minimize the amount of inventory held for resale and the risk of inventory obsolescence and decreases in market value 
the company attempts to maintain a level of inventory required to reach only its near term delivery requirements by relying on the ready availability of products from its principal suppliers 
manufacturers of the company s major products have in the past generally provided price protection  which reduces the company s exposure to decreases in prices  but during most major product manufacturers reduced or largely eliminated price protection 
the company s suppliers generally allow for some levels of returns of excess inventory  which  on a limited basis  are made without material restocking fees 
during  the companies suppliers generally became more restrictive in their policies regarding product return privileges 
inventory turnover for  and was times  times  and times  respectively 
credit facilities on february  the company executed agreements with deutsche financial services dfs for a revolving line of credit the dfs facility which replaced the company s prior primary credit facility as the company s principal source of liquidity 
the company s prior primary credit facility with ibm credit corporation ibmcc was converted into a credit facility for the purchase of ibm branded computer products the ibmcc facility 
the total credit available under the dfs facility is  subject to borrowing base limitations which are generally computed as a percentage of various classes of eligible accounts receivable and qualifying inventory 
credit available under the dfs facility for floor plan financing of inventory from approved manufacturers the inventory line is  available credit under the dfs facility  net of inventory line advances  is  which is used by the company primarily to carry accounts receivable and for other working capital and general corporate purposes the accounts line 
borrowings under the accounts line bear interest at the fluctuating prime rate minus per annum 
under the inventory line  dfs pays the company s inventory vendors directly  generally in exchange for negotiated financial incentives 
typically  the financial incentives received are such that dfs does not charge interest to the company until days after the transaction is financed  at which time the company is required to either pay the full invoice amount of the inventory purchased from corporate funds or to borrow under the accounts line for the amount due to dfs 
inventory line advances not paid within days after the financing date bear interest at the fluctuating prime rate plus 
for purposes of calculating interest charges the minimum prime rate under the dfs facility is 
dfs may change the computation of the borrowing base and disqualify accounts receivable upon which advances have been made and require repayment of such advances to the extent such disqualifications cause the company s borrowings to exceed the reduced borrowing base 
the dfs facility is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the company s assets  including its accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and bank accounts 
collections of the company s accounts receivable are required to be applied through a lockbox arrangement to repay indebtedness to dfs  however  dfs has amended the lockbox agreement to make such arrangements contingent upon certain financial ratios 
provided the company is in compliance with its debt to tangible net worth covenant  the company has discretion over the use and application of the funds collected in the lockbox 
if the company exceeds that financial ratio  dfs may require that lockbox payments be applied to reduce the company s indebtedness to dfs 
if in the future dfs requires that all lockbox payments be applied to reduce the company s indebtedness  the company would be required to seek funding from dfs or other sources to meet substantially all of its cash needs 
the dfs agreement contains restrictive covenants which  among other things  require specific ratios of current assets to current liabilities and debt to tangible net worth and require allstar to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
the terms of the agreement also prohibits the payment of dividends and other similar expenditures  including advances to related parties 
the ibmcc facility is a  credit facility for the purchase of ibm branded inventory from certain suppliers 
advances under the ibmcc facility are typically interest free for days after the financing date for transactions in which adequate financial incentives are received by ibmcc from the vendor 
within days after the financing date  the full amount of the invoice for inventory financed through ibmcc is required to be paid by the company 
amounts remaining outstanding thereafter bear interest at the fluctuating prime rate but not less than plus 
ibmcc retains a security interest in the inventory financed 
the ibmcc facility is immediately terminable by either party by written notice to the other 
both the ibmcc facility and the dfs facility prohibit the payment of dividends unless consented to by the lender 
year issue the year problem generally results from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
when computers must process dates both before and after january   two digit year fields may create processing ambiguities that can cause errors and system failures 
for example  a date represented by may be interpreted by the system as referring to the year rather than the effects of the year problem can be exacerbated by the interdependence of computer and telecommunications systems in the united states and throughout the world 
this interdependence can affect the company and its suppliers  trading partners  and customers outside entities 
the following are some of the identified risks related to the year problem shortage of resources 
between now and the year it is anticipated that there will be increased competition for people with technical and managerial skills necessary to deal with the year problem 
both the company and outside entities could face an inability to attract and or keep personnel with the necessary skills to solve and or mitigate problems related to the year problem 
potential shortcomings 
the company estimates that its mission critical systems will be year ready substantially before january  however  there is no assurance that the yk plan will succeed in accomplishing its purpose  or that unforeseen circumstances will not arise during implementation of the project that would materially adversely affect the company 
cascading effect 
the company is taking reasonable steps to identify  assess and  where appropriate  to replace devices that contain embedded microprocessors that cannot be determined to be warranted by the manufacturer to be year ready 
despite these reasonable efforts  the company anticipates that it will not be able to find and remediate all embedded microprocessors in all systems 
further  it is anticipated that outside entities also will not be able to find and remediate all embedded microprocessors in their systems 
some of the disruptions  failures or errors may spread from the systems in which they are located  including from systems of outside entities  to other of the company s systems causing adverse effects upon the company s ability to maintain safe operations  to serve its customers and otherwise to fulfill certain contractual and other legal obligations 
third parties 
the company cannot assure that suppliers upon which it depends for essential goods and services  or customers upon which it depends for revenue and for timely payment of amounts due to the company  will convert and test their mission critical systems and processes in a timely manner 
failure or delay by all or some of these entities  including federal  state or local governments  could create substantial disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
state of readiness the company s board of directors has been briefed about the year problem 
the board of directors has adopted a year project the yk plan aimed at preventing the company s mission critical functions from being impaired due to the year problem 
mission critical functions are those critical functions whose loss would cause an immediate stoppage or significant impairment to core business processes 
the company s vice president of information systems is supervising the implementation of the yk plan 
the company is actively implementing the yk plan  which will be modified as events warrant 
under the plan  the company has inventoried all of the computer systems and the telephone system at its corporate offices 
the company is upgrading all computer and software systems that cannot be verified as warranted by the system s manufacturer to be year compliant 
the company s corporate offices telephone system is warranted by the manufacturer to be year compliant 
during the second quarter of  the company will complete an inventory of all computers  software and telephone systems used in its branch offices and will upgrade or replace any systems that cannot be verified as warranted by the system s manufacturer to be year compliant 
the company s yk plan recognizes that the computer  telecommunications and other systems of outside entities have the potential for major  mission critical  adverse effects on the conduct of company business 
the company does not have control of these outside entities or outside systems  however  the company s yk plan includes attempting to verify the readiness of those outside entities or outside systems which might possibly have a material adverse effect on the company s business by contacting those outside entities to determine their readiness and to coordinate with those outside entities to mitigate the possibility of an interruption of any mission critical process 
the company will  throughout  attempt to evaluate the readiness of any outside systems which might possibly create a material adverse effect on any mission critical process 
it is important to recognize that the processes of inventorying  assessing  analyzing  converting where necessary  testing  and developing contingency plans for mission critical items in anticipation of the year event may be iterative processes  requiring a repeat of some or all of these processes as the company learns more about the year problem and its effects on the internal business information systems and on outside systems  and about the effects of embedded microprocessors on systems and business operations 
the company anticipates that it will continue with these processes through january  and on into the year in order to assess and remediate problems that reasonably can be identified only after the start of the new century 
costs to address year issues the company has not incurred substantial historical costs for year awareness  inventory  assessment  analysis  conversion  testing  or contingency planning and anticipates that any future costs for these purposes  including those for implementing year contingency plans  are not likely to be substantial 
the company has incurred expenditures  as part of an overall upgrading of its computer and telecommunications systems  during and through to date 
the company has also recognized higher expenditures in managing its information and telecommunications systems as staff members have expended time and resources evaluating the company s year readiness and implemented required changes 
it is difficult to assess the additional expenditures over and above what would have been expended under normal circumstances  but the company estimates that it incurred expenditures of approximately over and above that which would have been incurred were it not for the year issue 
the company currently believes that the additional expenditures specifically related to preparing for the year issue will not be significant 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the costs of implementing the yk plan will not differ materially from the estimated costs or that the company will not be materially adversely affected by year issues 
worst case scenario the securities and exchange commission requires that public companies must forecast the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario  assuming that the company s year plan is not effective 
analysis of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios the company may face leads to contemplation of the following possibilities which  though considered highly unlikely  must be included in any consideration of worst cases widespread failure of electrical  natural gas  and similar supplies by utilities serving the company  widespread disruption of the services of communications common carriers  similar disruption to means and modes of transportation for the company and its employees  contractors  suppliers  and customers  significant disruption to the company s ability to gain access to  and continue working in  office buildings and other facilities  the failure of substantial numbers of mission critical hardware and software computer systems  including both internal business systems and other systems such as those with embedded microprocessors  and the failure of outside systems  the effects of which would have a cumulative material adverse impact on the company s mission critical systems 
among other things  the company could face substantial claims by customers for loss of revenues due to service level interruptions  inability to fulfill contractual obligations  inability to account for certain revenues or obligations or to bill customers or pay vendors accurately and on a timely basis  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following mission critical failures  and the execution of contingency plans 
the company could also experience an inability by customers  and others to pay  on a timely basis or at all  obligations owed to the company 
the company s suppliers may not be able to deliver goods and services required by the company 
under these circumstances  the adverse effect on the company  and the diminution of company revenues  could be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
further in this scenario  the cumulative effect of these failures could have a substantial adverse effect on the economy  domestically and internationally 
the adverse effect on the company  and the diminution of company revenues  from a domestic or global recession or depression also could be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
the company will continue to monitor business conditions with the aim of assessing and quantifying material adverse effects  if any  that result or may result from the year problem 
as part of its yk plan  the company is developing contingency plans that deal with  among others  two primary aspects of the year problem i that the company  despite its good faith  reasonable efforts  may not have satisfactorily remediated all internal  mission critical systems  and ii that systems of outside entities may not be year ready  despite the company s good faith  reasonable efforts to work with outside entities 
these contingency plans are being designed to mitigate the disruptions or other adverse effects resulting from year incompatibilities regarding these mission critical functions or systems  and to facilitate the early identification and remediation of mission critical year problems that first manifest themselves after january  these contingency plans will contemplate an assessment of all mission critical internal information and communications technology systems and internal operational systems that use computer based controls and any recognizable potential outside entities or systems which might possibly have a material adverse affect on any mission critical processes 
this process will be pursued continuously into the year as circumstances require 
these contingency plans will include the creation  as deemed reasonably appropriate  of teams that will be standing by on the eve of the new millennium  prepared to respond rapidly and otherwise as necessary to mitigate any problems with mission critical processes as soon as they become known
