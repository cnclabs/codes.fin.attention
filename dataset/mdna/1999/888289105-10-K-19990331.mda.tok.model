item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is an independent energy company engaged in the exploitation  development  exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
the company s strategy is to grow reserves  production and net income per share through i the exploitation and development of its reserve base  ii the acquisition of producing properties that provide significant development and exploratory drilling potential  iii the exploration for oil and gas reserves  iv capitalization on advanced technology to identify  explore and exploit projects  v financial flexibility  and vi a low overhead and operating cost structure 
the company has grown rapidly through the acquisition and exploitation of oil and gas properties  consummating the acquisition for a purchase price of approximately million  the acquisition for approximately million and the pioneer acquisition  in  for approximately million 
in addition  the company issued  in   shares and  shares of the company s common stock in connection with the oedc acquisition and the carrollton acquisition  respectively 
the company s growth from acquisitions has impacted its financial results in a number of ways 
acquired properties may not have received focused attention prior to sale 
after acquisition  certain of these properties required extensive maintenance  workovers  recompletions and other remedial activity that while not constituting capital expenditures may initially increase lease operating expenses 
the company may dispose of certain of the properties it determines are outside the company s strategic focus 
the increased production and revenue resulting from the rapid growth of the company has required it to recruit and develop operating  accounting and administrative personnel compatible with its increased size 
as a result  the company has incurred increases in its general and administrative expense levels 
the company believes that with its current inventory of drilling locations and the additional staff it will be well positioned to follow a more balanced program of exploration and exploitation activities to complement its acquisition efforts 
the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas producing activities 
costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that result in proved reserves  and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
costs to drill exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves  and geological and geophysical costs are expensed 
costs of significant nonproducing properties  wells in the process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
the company s predecessor was classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no income taxes were paid by the company prior to the conversion 
future tax amounts  if any  will be dependent upon several factors  including  but not limited to  the company s results of operations 
impact of crude oil prices during  the posted price of west texas intermediate crude oil the west texas crude oil price ranged from to per barrel 
these low prices are thought to be caused primarily by an oversupply of crude oil inventory created  in part  by an unusually warm winter in the united states and europe  the apparent unwillingness of organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to abide by their respective crude oil production quotas and a decline in demand in certain asian markets 
if the west texas crude oil price worsens or persists for a protracted period  it will adversely affect the company s revenues  net income and cash flows from operations 
also  if these prices maintain their present level for an extended time period or decline further  the company may delay or postpone certain of its capital projects 
if the posted west texas crude oil price continues to decline  the company would expect that it may be required to record an impairment to its oil and gas properties in the extent of an impairment  if any  cannot be determined 
it is the company s expectation that it will not have positive earnings in or the near term future unless oil and gas commodity prices improve above their current levels  especially the price of crude oil 
year issues many computer software systems  as well as certain hardware and equipment using date sensitive data  were structured to use a two digit date field meaning that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year the company is addressing this issue through a process that entails evaluation of the company s critical software and  to the extent possible  its hardware and equipment to identify and assess year issues and to remediate  replace or establish alternative procedures addressing non year complaint systems  hardware and equipment 
the company has substantially completed an inventory of its systems and equipment including computer systems and business applications 
based upon this review  the company currently believes that all of its critical software and computer hardware systems are either year compliant or will be within the next six months 
the company continues to inventory its equipment and facilities to determine if they contain embedded date sensitive technology 
if problems are discovered  remediation  replacement or alternative procedures for non compliant equipment and facilities will be undertaken on a business priority basis 
this process will continue and  depending upon the equipment and facilities  is scheduled for completion during the first three quarters of as of december   the company had not incurred any material amount of expense related to its year compliance efforts 
these costs are currently being expensed as they are incurred 
however  in certain instances the company may determine that replacing existing equipment may be more efficient  particularly where additional functionality is available 
these replacements may be capitalized and therefore would reduce the estimated expenses associated with the year issue 
the company currently expects total out of pocket costs to become year compliant to be less than  the company currently expects that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operations or liquidity 
the foregoing timetable and assessment of costs to become year compliant reflect management s current best estimates 
these estimates are based on many assumptions  including assumptions about the cost  availability and ability of resources to locate  remediate and modify affected systems  equipment and facilities 
based upon its activities to date  the company does not currently believe that these factors will cause results to differ significantly from those estimated 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial condition and operations if key third parties including  among others  suppliers  contractors  joint venture partners  financial institutions  customers and governments do not become year compliant on a timely basis 
the company is contacting many of these third parties to determine whether they will be able to resolve in a timely fashion their year issues as they may affect the company 
in the event that the company is unable to complete the remediation or replacement of its critical systems  facilities and equipment  establish alternative procedures in a timely manner  or if those with whom the company conducts business are unsuccessful in implementing timely solutions  year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
at this time  the potential effect in the event the company and or third parties are unable to timely resolve their year problems is not determinable  however  the company currently believes that it will be able to resolve its own year issues in a timely manner

depletion  depreciation and amortization 


results of operations the company began operations on march  as a result of the company s limited operating history and rapid growth  its financial statements are not readily comparable and may not be indicative of future results 
the acquisition  which closed on october   did not contribute fully to the company s operating results 
the oedc acquisition  the carrollton acquisition and the pioneer acquisition  did not close until the end of december which did not contribute to the operating results 
year ended as compared to the company s revenues from the sale of oil and gas excluding the effects of hedging activities were million and million in and million and million in  respectively 
realized oil and gas prices decreased per bbl and 
per mcf  respectively 
in  the acquisitions contributed oil sales of million and gas sales of million with associated production of approximately mbls of oil and  mmcf of gas  respectively 
the decrease in oil revenues due to price was offset by an increase in production primarily attributable to the acquisitions 
gas revenues increased as a result of increased production  primarily the result of the acquisitions  despite a decrease in gas prices 
excluding the acquisitions  the oil and gas production was relatively flat compared to the increase in production  assuming prices  would have resulted in additional revenues to the company of million while the decrease in prices reduced revenues by million 
the company s hedging activities in increased both oil and gas revenues  
per bbl and million 
per mcf  respectively  as compared to  when hedging activities increased oil and reduced gas revenues  
per bbl and  
per mcf  respectively 
at december  the company had no oil hedges in place  however  gas hedges for  mmcf of the company s production through early were outstanding 
the hedges will allow the company to realize  at a minimum  a price of per mcf on the volumes hedged 
the outstanding gas hedges had a fair value of approximately million at december  the company s oil and gas production costs were million 
per mcfe and million 
per mcfe in and  respectively 
in  productions costs attributable to the acquisitions were million per mcfe 
thus  the increase in production costs is primarily related to the acquisitions 
excluding the acquisitions  the company s production costs would have decreased slightly on an absolute and mcfe basis 
initially  acquired properties generally incur significant rework expenses  which are costs incurred to perform required maintenance  workovers and other remedial activities 
the properties acquired in the pioneer acquisition were primarily oil in nature and generally have a higher per unit production cost as compared to gas properties 
the company expects that going forward  with its existing asset base  the per unit production costs should decrease below levels 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a was million 
mcfe and million 
per mcfe in and  respectively 
in and  dd a included 
per mcfe and 
per mcfe  respectively  of depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment and other assets 
in the fourth quarter of the company recorded an impairment of million which acted to reduce the dd a rate going forward 
this effect was offset by the higher finding costs for the properties acquired in the acquisitions as compared to previous acquisitions 
through the first three quarters of  the company s dd a rate was slightly below the rates for the prior comparable quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  the company lost proved reserves due to the decrease primarily in oil prices  which had an adverse effect on the fourth quarter dd a rate 
the fourth quarter dd a rate caused the annual dd a rate for to slightly exceed that of the company recognized an impairment of million and million in and  respectively 
the impairment was primarily related to significantly depressed commodity prices as compared to the expected commodity prices on which most of the properties were acquired 
the impairment was comprised of three components a million related to oil and gas properties  b million related to impairment of an investment in a partnership and c million related to assets held for sale 
the impairment related to the oil and gas properties is primarily attributable to loss of proved reserves associated with below expectation developmental drilling results and downhole mechanical problems primarily from the company s gulf coast and gulf of mexico regions 
the company s exploration and abandonment expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase is due primarily to a increased geological and geophysical staff  b impairment of unproved properties  c uneconomical exploratory wells and d delay rentals 
increase in the geological and geophysical staff was due to the company s exploratory efforts primarily associated with the oedc and carrollton acquisitions in the gulf coast and gulf of mexico regions 
with the company s planned divestitures in these regions  there should be a reduction in the geological and geophysical staff costs 
the company s webb county prospect  previously discussed  is the significant contributing factor to the increase due to a million uneconomical exploratory well  b million impairment of the unproved acreage and c approximately million in delay rentals paid in to hold leases 
the company s general and administrative expense g a was million 
per mcfe and million 
per mcfe in and  respectively 
g a attributable to the oedc and carrollton acquisitions was over million over 
per mcfe in excluding the oedc and carrollton acquisitions  g a would have been approximately 
per mcfe 
after excluding the oedc and carrollton acquisitions  the remainder of the increase in g a from to is primarily the result of a full year s effect of the increase in staff in necessitated by the company s growth 
with the planned disposition of assets in  and other cost cutting measures taken  the company expects a decrease in its g a on both an absolute and per mcfe basis 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a restructuring charge of  this charge relates to the severance and related benefits that will be provided to individuals whose positions are being eliminated as a result of the planned disposition of assets in the equity in net loss of affiliates is attributable to the company s ownership in digp and mbpp acquired in the oedc acquisition 
included in the equity loss is approximately  of amortization of the company s cost basis in excess of the underlying historical net assets of digp 
the amortization of the company s cost basis in excess of the underlying historical net assets of mbpp will commence being recorded when the underlying assets commence operations  which is expected to be the first quarter of the company s interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in debt levels between years 
in  the average debt outstanding was lower as a result of the december initial public common stock offering 
in  the average outstanding debt obligation increased primarily due to a the pioneer acquisition in december  b the purchase of treasury stock  c the assumption of million in debt from the oedc and carrollton acquisitions  d the company s capital expenditure program and e the reduction in operating cash flow due to significantly depressed commodity prices 
the company s effective income tax rates were and for and  respectively 
the decrease in rate is due to the company s inability in to recognize the income tax benefit associated with a loss before income taxes because it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize all its available loss carryforwards prior to their ultimate expiration 
due to the company s inability to potentially use its loss carryforwards  the company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately million against its deferred tax assets 
in and in future years  the company will not be able to recognize an income tax benefit until the company begins to generate an adequate level of earnings before income taxes 
year ended december  for the year ended december   the company s revenues from the sale of oil and gas excluding the effects of hedging activities were million and million  respectively 
of total gross oil and gas revenues  million and million are attributable to the acquisition and the acquisition  respectively 
during the year  the company produced mbbls of oil mbbls attributable to the acquisition and mbbls attributable to the acquisition and  mmcf of gas  mmcf attributable to the acquisition and  mmcf attributable to the acquisition  with total oil and gas production of  mmcfe 
the revenues and production are primarily attributable to the acquisition since the acquisition did not close until october  as a result of hedging activities in the year ended december   oil revenues were reduced million per bbl and gas revenues were reduced  
per mcf for a total reduction of  oil and gas production costs  including production taxes  were million 
per mcfe for the year ended december  these costs included million 
per mcfe of rework expenses of which  were attributable to the acquisition and million were attributable to the acquisition 
exploration and abandonment costs were  for the year ended december general and administrative expenses were million 
per mcfe for the year ended december  for the year ended december   depletion  depreciation and amortization expense was million 
per mcfe 
this represents a full year of depletion  depreciation and amortization relating to production for the acquisition and two months of depletion  depreciation and amortization relating to production for the acquisition 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  the interest expense was attributable to bank financing incurred primarily to fund the acquisition and the acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of capital have been its initial capitalization  private equity sales  bank financing  cash flow from operations and the company s initial public offering 
the acquisition was principally funded with bank financing  which was repaid with the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
the oedc acquisition and the carrollton acquisition were completed by issuing common stock in exchange for the equity interest in each entity 
the pioneer acquisition was funded with bank financing 
net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  before changes in operating assets and liabilities  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in operating and interest costs with a slight decrease in revenues 
revenues were significantly below expectation due to depressed commodity prices 
capital expenditures 
in  the company budgeted million for capital expenditures and had actual cash expenditures of million 
the company did not spend all of its budget primarily as a result of deferring some of its exploration and production projects mainly oil and the million pipeline and processing project investments due to uncertainties over future commodity price levels 
cash expenditures for investing in oil gas properties were million for the year ended december  this includes million for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and million for development and exploratory drilling 
the company requires capital primarily for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  the repayment of indebtedness and general working capital needs 
the following table sets forth costs incurred by the company in its exploration  development and acquisition activities 
year ended december  development costs exploration costs acquisition costs unproved properties proved properties total for  the company  currently  expects to spend i approximately million on developmental projects  ii approximately million on exploratory and probable projects  of which million relates to contingent projects following successful exploratory and probable projects  iii approximately million to acquire additional acreage and seismic data and iv 
million on other items 
the final determination with respect to the drilling of any well  including those currently budgeted  will depend on a number of factors  including i the results of exploration efforts and the review and analysis of the seismic data  ii the availability of sufficient capital resources by the company and other participants for drilling prospects  iii economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability and costs of drilling rigs and crews  iv the financial resources and results of the company  and v the availability of leases on reasonable terms and permitting for the potential drilling location 
there can be no assurance that the budgeted wells will encounter  if drilled  recompleted or worked over  reservoirs of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil 
while the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties  the company has no present agreement  commitment or understanding with respect to any such acquisition  other than the acquisition of oil and gas properties and interests in its normal course business 
any future acquisitions may require additional financing and will be dependent upon financing which may be required in the future to fund the company s acquisition and drilling programs 
capital resources 
the company s primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities and the availability under the credit agreement  of which million was available at december  credit agreement 
the credit agreement established a four year revolving credit facility  up to a maximum amount of million  subject to a borrowing base to be redetermined semi annually by the lenders based on certain proved oil and gas reserves and other assets of the company 
the borrowing base at december  was million 
to the extent that the borrowing base is less than the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding loans and letters of credit under the credit agreement  such deficiency must be cured by the company ratably within days  by either prepaying a portion of the outstanding amounts under the credit agreement or pledging additional collateral to the lenders 
a portion of the credit facility is available for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit  of which  was outstanding at december  all outstanding amounts under the credit agreement are due and payable in full on january  the company s outstanding debt under the credit agreement was million on december  the company will undergo a borrowing base review in april in light of the depressed commodity prices and the related effect on the company s oil and gas reserves  the company cannot be reasonably assured that it will be able to maintain its current million borrowing base 
at the company s option  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either the base rate ie  the higher of the applicable prime commercial lending rate  or the federal funds rate plus 
per annum or the eurodollar rate  plus to per annum  depending on the level of the company s aggregate outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the company is committed to pay quarterly in arrears a fee of 
to 
of the unused borrowing base 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions that are customary in the oil and gas industry 
in addition  the line of credit is secured by a majority of the company s proved oil and gas properties 
at december   the company was not in compliance with a coverage test required by the credit agreement 
the company has requested and received written consents from its banks to amend this coverage test of the credit agreement  and the company believes this amendment will be fully documented on or before april  the company believes it will be able to comply with the amended covenants of the credit agreement for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and working capital 
at december   the company had  of cash and cash equivalents as compared to million at december  the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  the company s working capital ratio increased due to million of assets held for sale at december  excluding the assets held for sale the company would have a working capital deficit of million 
the working capital deficit is due partially to the company maintaining low cash levels for cash management purposes 
the company  at december   has availability under its credit agreement to fund any working capital deficit 
unsecured credit agreement 
in april  the company entered into a credit agreement the unsecured credit agreement with texas commerce bank national association the bank  which establishes a revolving credit facility  up to the maximum of million 
all outstanding amounts pursuant to the unsecured credit agreement are due and payable in full on or before december  proceeds of the unsecured credit agreement are utilized to fund short term needs less than thirty days 
the company had million outstanding principal under the unsecured credit agreement at december  the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit agreement is at a rate determined by agreement between the company and the bank 
the rate may not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted under applicable laws 
interest rates generally are the bank s cost of funds plus per annum 
other matters stock options and compensation expense in connection with the conversion  the company issued options to purchase  shares of common stock to certain of its officers and employees in substitution for options issued by titan resources  lp of the options issued by the partnership approximately were issued on march   the date of inception  and approximately were issued as of september  the options issued by the company have an exercise price of per share 
options to purchase  shares of common stock are currently vested and an additional  shares will vest on march  based in part on selling prices of interests in the partnership in december and september  the company expected to record a noncash compensation expense of approximately  per month for a period of months beginning in october to reflect the estimated value of the revised option plan on september  noncash compensation expense recorded for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  the company issued additional options for aggregates of   and  shares  respectively  for which no deferred compensation was recorded as these options had no implicit value when issued 
hedging activities the company uses swap agreements and other financial instruments in an attempt to reduce the risk of fluctuating oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the company is party to various agreements with numerous counterparties for purposes of utilizing financial instruments  of which the company assesses the creditworthiness of its counterparties 
among other counterparties  the company has utilized enron capital trade resources corp 
an affiliate of a significant stockholder of the company as a counterparty 
settlement of gains or losses on the hedging transactions was generally based on the difference between the contract price and a formula using new york mercantile exchange nymex or other major indices related prices and was reported as a component of oil and gas revenues as the associated production occurs 
the company  at december   had entered into hedging transactions with respect to approximately  and  mmcfe of its and estimated production 
see risk factors risk of hedging activities 
crude oil the company reports average oil prices per bbl including the net effect of oil hedges 
in  and  the company received paid related to its oil hedges

natural gas balancing in the natural gas industry  various working interest partners produce more or less than their entitlement share of natural gas from time to time 
the company s net underproduced position at december  was approximately  mcf 
under terms of typical natural gas balancing agreements  the underproduced party can take a certain percentage  typically to of the overproduced party s entitled share of gas sales in future months  to eliminate such imbalances 
during the make up period  the overproduced party s cash flow will be adversely affected 
the company recognizes revenue and imbalance obligations under the entitlements method of accounting  which means that the company recognizes the revenue to which it is entitled and records a liability with respect to the value of the overproduced gas 
environmental and other laws and regulations the company s business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and transportation of oil and gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements 
nevertheless  changes in existing environmental laws or in interpretations thereof could have a significant adverse impact on the operating costs of the company  as well as the oil and gas industry in general

risk factors volatility of oil and gas prices  marketability of production our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
various factors which are beyond our control such as the worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  the ability of the members of the opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes and the overall economic environment will affect prices of oil and gas 
we are unable to predict the long term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of oil 
lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas we produce economically which may adversely affect our revenues and operating income and may require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
we make substantially all of our sales of oil and gas in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices and not pursuant to long term fixed price contracts 
we try to reduce price risk by entering into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our expected future production 
we cannot assure you  however  that such hedging transactions will reduce risk or mitigate the effect of any substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
most of our natural gas is delivered through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own 
federal and state regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions all could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our oil and gas 
any dramatic change in market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial capital requirements we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the exploration  development  acquisition and production of our oil and gas reserves 
we intend to finance these capital expenditures primarily with funds provided by operations  the incurrence of debt  the issuance of equity and the sale of non core assets 
our direct capital expenditures for oil and gas producing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and million for the nine months ended december  if revenues decrease as a result of lower oil or gas prices or otherwise  we may have limited ability to expend the capital necessary to replace our reserves or to maintain production at current levels  resulting in a decrease in production over time 
if our cash flow from operations and availability under our credit agreement are not sufficient to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing to meet these requirements 
uncertainty of reserve information and future net revenue estimates there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values  including many factors beyond our control 
the reserve information contained in our filings with the sec represents estimates only 
although we believe such estimates are reasonable  reserve estimates are imprecise and you should expect them to change as additional information becomes available 
estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  economic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially from those estimated in our filings with the sec 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our reserves will ultimately be produced or that our proved undeveloped reserves  the recovery of which requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations  will be developed within the periods anticipated 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
approximately of our total proved reserves on december  were undeveloped  which are by their nature less certain 
recovery of these reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data set forth in our estimates assumes that we will expend substantial capital to develop these reserves 
although we have prepared our cost and reserve estimates attributable to our oil and gas reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
in addition  you should not construe the pv referred to in this report to be the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with applicable requirements  we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  whereas actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  curtailments or increases in consumption by gas purchasers  changes in governmental regulations or taxation and other factors will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus also affect their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which the sec requires us to use in our calculation of the discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
reserve replacement risk our future success depends upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
our proved reserves will generally decline as a result of continued production  except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
in order to increase reserves and production  we must continue our development and exploration drilling and recompletion programs or undertake other replacement activities 
exploratory drilling and  to a lesser extent  development drilling involve a high degree of risk that we will not obtain commercial production or that our production will be insufficient to recover drilling and completion costs 
we cannot state the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells with certainty 
numerous factors  including title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment may curtail  delay or cancel our drilling operations 
furthermore  there is no guarantee that we will recognize a profit on the investment or that we will recover our drilling  completion and operations cost upon the completion of a well 
there are certain risks associated with secondary recovery operations  especially the use of waterflooding techniques 
part of our inventory of development prospects consists of waterflood projects 
waterflooding involves significant capital expenditures and uncertainty as to the total amount of secondary reserves that we can recover 
in waterflood operations  there is generally a delay between the initiation of water injection into a formation containing hydrocarbons and any resulting increase in production 
the operating cost per unit of production of waterflood projects is generally higher during the initial phases of such projects due to the purchase of injection water and related costs  as well as during the later stages of the life of the project as production declines 
the degree of success  if any  of any secondary recovery program depends on a large number of factors  including the porosity of the formation  the technique used and the location of injector wells 
our current strategy includes increasing our reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties  continued exploitation of our existing properties and exploration of new and existing properties 
we cannot assure you  however  that our planned development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs 
furthermore  while our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and gas prices increase significantly  our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 
acquisition risks we expect to continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities available on terms that our management considers favorable to us 
the successful acquisition of producing properties involves an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control 
this assessment is necessarily inexact and its accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such an assessment of the subject properties  we perform a review that we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
this review  however  will not reveal all existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not be performed on every well  and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even upon inspection 
we generally assume preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities  and generally acquire interests in the properties on an as is basis 
with respect to our acquisitions to date  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements 
in addition  volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploration projects 
we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful 
any unsuccessful acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 
limited operating history  rapid growth we began operations in march  and our brief operating history includes three years of net losses and rapid growth 
as a result  our historical results are not readily comparable to and may not be indicative of future results 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience growth in  or maintain our current level of  revenues  oil and gas reserves or production 
future tax amounts  if any  will depend on several factors  including  but not limited to  our results of operations 
our rapid growth has placed significant demands on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
any future growth of our oil and gas reserves  production and operations would place significant further demands on our financial  operational and administrative resources 
our future performance and profitability will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the administrative and financial functions of acquired properties and companies into our operations  to hire additional personnel and to implement necessary enhancements to our management systems to respond to changes in our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
our inability to integrate acquired properties and companies  to hire additional personnel or to enhance our management systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
effects of leverage we have certain debt obligations that may affect our operations  including i our need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our indebtedness which prevents these funds from being available for other purposes  ii the covenants contained in our credit facility limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  and iii our potential inability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes 
moreover  future acquisition or development activities may require us to alter our capitalization significantly 
these changes in capitalization may significantly alter our leverage structure 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that economic conditions and financial  business and other factors will not adversely affect our future performance 
drilling and operating risks  uninsured risks drilling activities are subject to many risks  including well blow outs  cratering  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gases and other environmental hazards and risks  any of which could result in substantial losses to us 
our offshore operations are also subject to the additional hazards of marine operations such as severe weather  capsizing and collision 
in addition  we incur the risk that we will not encounter any commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in wells drilled 
drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells  but from wells that are productive but do not produce net reserves to return a profit after drilling  operating and other costs 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including economic conditions  mechanical problems  title problems  weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages and delays in the delivery of equipment and services may curtail  delay or cancel our drilling operations 
in accordance with industry practices  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks 
we cannot assure you that any of our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
risk of hedging activities our use of energy swap arrangements and financial futures to reduce our sensitivity to oil and gas price volatility is subject to a number of risks 
if we do not produce reserves at the rates we estimated due to inaccuracies in the reserve estimation process  operational difficulties or regulatory limitations  we would be required to satisfy obligations we may have under fixed price sales and hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of our own production 
further  the terms under which we enter into fixed price sales and hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation costs to delivery points 
substantial variations between the assumptions and estimates we used and actual results we experience could materially adversely affect our anticipated profit margins and our ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
additionally  fixed price sales and hedging contracts limit the benefits we will realize if actual prices rise above the contract prices 
in addition  fixed price sales and hedging contracts are subject to the risk that the counter party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts 
any significant nonperformance could have a material adverse financial effect on us 
as of december    and  mmcfe of our and production  respectively  were subject to hedging contracts 
gas gathering  processing and marketing our gas gathering  processing and marketing operations  which are currently not significant to the company  depend in large part on our ability to contract with third party producers to acquire their gas  to obtain sufficient volumes of committed natural gas reserves  to maintain throughput in our processing plant at optimal levels  to replace production from declining wells  to assess and respond to changing market conditions in negotiating gas purchase and sale agreements and to obtain satisfactory margins between the purchase price of our natural gas supply and the sales price for such residual gas volumes and the natural gas liquids processed 
in addition  our operations are subject to changes in regulations relating to gathering and marketing of oil and gas 
our inability to attract new sources of third party natural gas or to promptly respond to changing market conditions or regulations in connection with our gathering  processing and marketing operations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with government regulations our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and gas  as well as safety matters that change from time to time in response to economic or political conditions 
although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations change frequently  and these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation 
consequently  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to comply with government laws and regulations  and these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with environmental regulations our operations are subject to complex and constantly changing environmental laws and regulations adopted by federal  state and local governmental authorities 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to significant liability on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation 
moreover  we have agreed to indemnify sellers of producing properties purchased in each of our substantial acquisitions against environmental claims associated with these properties 
we cannot assure you that existing environmental laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations will not materially adversely affect the results of our operations or our financial condition or that material indemnity claims will not arise against us with respect to properties we acquired 
competition we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and gas exploration  development  acquisition and production with other companies  many of which have substantially larger financial resources  staffs and facilities 
in seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration and in marketing our oil and gas production  we face intense competition from both major and independent oil and gas companies 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
this highly competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on us 
dependence on key personnel our success has been and will continue to be highly dependent on jack hightower  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and a limited number of other senior management personnel 
loss of the services of mr 
hightower or any of those other individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we maintain a million key man life insurance policy on the life of mr 
hightower  but no other senior management personnel 
in addition  as a result of our acquisitions  we have increased our number of employees and employed employees at december  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining key personnel 
our failure to hire additional personnel  if necessary  or retain our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
control by existing stockholders our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders  and certain of our affiliates  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis at march  accordingly  these stockholders  as a group  are able to control the outcome of stockholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our amended certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect our management or direction 
these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or voting control 
anti takeover provisions delaware law includes a number of provisions that may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change in the control of our management and encouraging persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non negotiated takeover attempts 
these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from certain transactions which are opposed by the incumbent board of directors 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus  including  but not limited to  those regarding our financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations and any other statements which are not historical facts constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements
