item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion of operations overview after achieving record sales and earnings in fiscal  carpenter s results of operations declined in fiscal the lower results were driven primarily by reduced demand in key market sectors and increased competition from imported stainless steel products 
net sales and earnings trends for the past three fiscal years are summarized below in millions  except per share data net sales   net income diluted earnings per share excludes a special charge of million after taxes or 
per diluted share for the personnel related costs of a salaried work force reduction and a reconfiguration of carpenter s us distribution network see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these salaried staff reductions and distribution network changes are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million after taxes 
the chart below shows net sales by major material group for the past three fiscal years in millions sales sales sales stainless steel special alloys titanium products ceramics and other materials tool and other steel total   results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales were  million in fiscal  a percent decrease from the record level of  million in fiscal reduced unit volume accounted for approximately million of the sales decrease 
unit selling price decreases averaged percent  accounting for million of the sales decrease 
most of these negative effects were experienced in the specialty metals segment and were partially offset by the inclusion of a full year s sales in fiscal for companies acquired during fiscal sales outside the united states rose by percent to million during fiscal approximately million of these sales were to customers in europe where additional market share was obtained through expansion of sales efforts and the acquisition of a strip facility and a metal injection products company 
details of sales by geographic region for the past three fiscal years are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to percent in fiscal from percent a year earlier  because of lower production levels  selling price reductions and a less profitable product mix in the specialty metals segment 
reduced staffing levels  lower raw material costs and increased pension credits helped to partially offset the margin decline 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal were higher than in fiscal by million  primarily because of the impact of newly acquired companies and increases in salaries 
reductions in salaried staffing levels  lower bonus payments and improved pension credits helped to offset these effects 
net pension credits resulting from the pension plans overfunded status reduced cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses by million in fiscal and million in fiscal this improved level of credit was primarily the result of market investment performance of the plans assets 
other income expense  net was favorable by million as compared to fiscal this improvement was primarily related to a nonrecurring pre tax loss of million in fiscal for the sale of a joint venture in taiwan 
income taxes as a percent of pre tax income effective tax rate was approximately percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the resolution of certain prior year state tax issues was the major factor in the lower rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the effective tax rate 
business segment results see note to the consolidated financial statements specialty metals segment in millions decrease net sales  income before interest expense and income taxes ebit excludes special charge of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the percent decrease in net sales was due to a combination of lower unit volume and reduced selling prices  each accounting for about one half of the sales decline 
selling prices for both the specialty alloys products and dynamet s titanium products were lower by percent  in part due to lower nickel  cobalt and titanium costs but also because of intense competition 
in stainless products the increased competition from imported steel was a key factor 
sales to the aerospace market sector were adversely affected by inventory reductions by customers to correct for overstocked inventory positions 
sales to industrial end use markets were another area of weakness  especially in products for petrochemical  semiconductor and processing industry applications 
automotive products were down moderately as a result of a general motors strike early in the year and design changes 
ebit fell percent primarily because of the lower unit sales volume and selling prices 
profit margins were also affected by a less profitable product mix and a lower production level as inventories were reduced 
lower costs for raw materials  more favorable pension credits and reductions in salaried and production staffing levels helped offset the sales effects 
engineered products segment increase in millions decrease net sales income before interest expense and income taxes ebit the percent increase in sales was the result of including a full year s sales in fiscal for carpenter advanced ceramics  which was acquired during  and volume growth  particularly in ceramic cores for aerospace and land based turbine blade castings and in structural ceramics applications 
sales of the mexican steel distribution business were down because of the weak mexican economy 
the percent decrease in ebit was due to several factors 
ebit of the mexican distribution network was hurt by the weak economy there 
developmental costs for new metal injection molded products  start up costs for three new ceramics facilities and expanded sales and marketing and process research programs were higher in fiscal finally  an equipment impairment loss of million was recognized in fiscal results of operations fiscal versus fiscal net sales were  million in fiscal  a percent increase from the million achieved in fiscal approximately percent of the sales increase resulted from inclusion of the results of businesses acquired during fiscal and the full year effects of businesses included for only a portion of fiscal excluding businesses acquired  sales were up by percent due to strong demand in most market sectors  but especially for aerospace applications 
average unit selling prices for most specialty metals products remained about the same as in fiscal carpenter s sales outside the united states increased by percent to million during fiscal more than half of the sales were in europe where sales increased by percent due to the acquisition of dynamet incorporated and expanded market share 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales dropped to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal this improvement occurred due to improved margins and a higher production level in the specialty metals segment and the full year effect of dynamet s sales 
selling and administrative expenses were higher than in fiscal by million and increased to percent of sales versus percent in fiscal about percent of the increased costs resulted from the inclusion of costs for acquired businesses 
increased costs to support sales office expansions  higher distribution costs resulting from increased sales levels  and increased professional fees accounted for most of the remaining year to year increase 
net pension credits reduced cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses by million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in these net credits was a result of improved market investment performance of the plans assets 
interest expense increased by million mainly because of debt incurred to acquire businesses and working capital requirements 
other income expense  net was negatively impacted in fiscal by million 
the sale of carpenter s remaining investment in a joint venture in taiwan resulted in a million pre tax loss in fiscal in addition  provisions for losses on former carpenter plant sites held for sale increased by million in fiscal income taxes as a percent of pre tax income effective tax rate was approximately percent in fiscal years and a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the federal statutory rate is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business segment results specialty metals segment in millions increase net sales  income before interest expense and income taxes ebit the percent increase in net sales was the result of increased unit volume shipments of the specialty alloys unit and the inclusion of the dynamet incorporated unit for a full year in fiscal versus only four months in fiscal dynamet was acquired in february 
demand was strong in most market sectors  but especially for aerospace applications 
sales of high temperature alloys and titanium were at high levels  driven by increased customer demand to support strong commercial aircraft build schedules 
unit selling prices for most products remained about the same as in fiscal the percent increase in ebit was primarily the result of the increased unit volume sold  higher production levels and the inclusion of dynamet s results for the full year 
higher pension credits  lower raw material costs and productivity improvements also contributed to the improved ebit 
engineered products segment in millions increase net sales income before interest expense and income taxes ebit approximately percent of the sales improvement was due to the inclusion of sales of rathbone precision metals  carpenter advanced ceramics and aceromex atlas  which were acquired in early fiscal the remainder of the sales improvement was due to a strong demand in the mexican distribution business and the ceramic core business for aerospace and land based turbine applications 
the ebit improvement was attributable to inclusion of the acquired companies mentioned above and the unit volume improvements in mexico and ceramics products 
ebit in both periods was adversely affected by research and development expenditures for ceramics and metal injection molding technologies 
management s discussion of cash flow and financial condition cash flow cash flow from operations was strong over the past three years 
net cash generated from operating activities was million in fiscal  despite the weak business conditions 
this level was down from the record million of fiscal but above the cash flow of million 
investing activities used million of cash in fiscal  a significant drop from the million and million used in fiscal and  respectively 
the reduced level in fiscal was due to proceeds from the sales of the talley business segments carpenter didn t choose to keep and a reduction in business acquisition activities  offset by higher capital expenditures 
capital expenditures continued at a high level 
fiscal expenditures totaled million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal the level was lower than originally planned because of reevaluations of capital needs in view of current business conditions 
the major expenditures during fiscal were for new strip facilities  a new forging press and capacity expansion projects at the hartsville  south carolina  facility 
the total remaining costs on approved projects in excess of million was million at june  of this amount  million has been placed on hold pending changes in business conditions 
the most significant open projects are for the completion of the strip modernization and expansion and forge press 
total capital spending for all projects is expected to be million in fiscal and then decrease to a level below the annual depreciation expense of approximately million after business acquisition activities were at a much lower pace in fiscal than in the two prior years 
fiscal acquisition spending totaled million versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal the acquisitions in fiscal included the strip business of telcon  ltd  in the united kingdom and two joint ventures for specialty steel production and distribution in india 
the most significant acquisitions in fiscal and were talley industries  inc  and dynamet incorporated  respectively 
details of acquisition activities for the past three years are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal and  carpenter sold all of the businesses of the talley industries  inc  government products and services and industrial products segments  as planned at the time talley was acquired in fiscal these sales resulted in net proceeds before taxes of million in fiscal and million in fiscal additional detail regarding these divestitures is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total debt decreased by million to million in fiscal debt as a percent of total capital debt  deferred taxes and shareholders equity increased to percent at june   from percent at the beginning of the fiscal year

financial condition and liquidity during the past three fiscal years  carpenter maintained the ability to provide adequate cash to meet its needs through cash flow from operations  management of working capital and its flexibility to use outside sources of financing to supplement internally generated funds 
carpenter ended fiscal in a strong liquidity position  with current assets exceeding current liabilities by million a ratio of to 
this ratio is conservatively stated because certain inventories are valued million less than the current cost as a result of using the lifo method 
financing is available under a million financing arrangement with four banks  providing for million of revolving credit and lines of credit of million

details of financing arrangements are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
carpenter believes that its present financial resources  both from internal and external resources  will be adequate to meet its foreseeable short term and long term liquidity needs 
market sensitive instruments and risk management carpenter uses derivative financial instruments to reduce certain types of financial risk 
raw material cost fluctuations for the specialty metals segment are normally offset by selling price adjustments primarily through the use of surcharge mechanisms and base price adjustments 
firm price sales contracts involve a risk of profit margin decline in the event of raw material increases 
carpenter reduces this risk by entering into commodity futures and commodity price swaps which are effective hedges of the risk 
fluctuations in foreign exchange subject carpenter to risk of losses on anticipated future cash flows from its foreign operations 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge this foreign exchange risk 
these hedging strategies are reviewed and approved by management before being implemented 
management has established policies regarding the use of derivative instruments which prohibit the use of speculative or leveraged derivatives 
monthly market valuations are performed to monitor the effectiveness of carpenter s risk management programs 
the status of carpenter s financial instruments as of june  and  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
assuming a an instantaneous percent decrease in the price of raw materials for which carpenter has commodity futures and swaps  b a percent strengthening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies for which foreign exchange forward contracts existed  and c a percent change in interest rates on carpenter s short term debt had all occurred on june  and  carpenter s results of operations  cash flow and financial position would not have been materially affected 
commitments and contingencies environmental carpenter has environmental liabilities at some of its owned operating facilities  and has been designated as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to certain superfund waste disposal sites 
additionally  carpenter has been notified that it may be a prp with respect to other superfund sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against carpenter 
neither the exact amount of cleanup costs nor the final method of their allocation among all designated prps at these superfund sites has been determined 
carpenter accrues amounts for environmental remediation costs that represent management s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs related to environmental remediation 
the liability recorded for environmental cleanup costs at june  was million 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible costs of remediation at carpenter owned operating facilities and the superfund sites is between million and million as of june  recoveries of expenditures are recognized as receivables when they are estimable and probable 
additional details are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
carpenter does not anticipate that its financial position will be materially affected by additional environmental remediation costs  although quarterly or annual operating results could be materially affected by future developments 
other carpenter also is defending various claims and legal actions  and is subject to commitments and contingencies that are common to its operations 
carpenter provides for costs relating to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
additional details are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while it is not feasible to determine the outcome of these matters  management believes that any total ultimate liability will not have a material effect on carpenter s financial position or results of operations and cash flows 
year issues carpenter s state of readiness carpenter has been formally addressing its year issues since march these efforts involve developing an inventory  assessing the year impact  developing conversion plans  remediating noncompliant items  testing  contacting mission critical vendors and suppliers  contacting selected customers  and developing contingency plans 
a project team representing all business units has been in place since december and meeting regularly to monitor and report on the status of the project 
all known year projects have been completed as of august  risks of year issues and contingency plans carpenter expects that all of its systems will be fully operational and will not cause any material disruptions because of year issues 
contingency plans are being developed for any process determined to be mission critical 
contingency planning is scheduled to be completed for all business units by september  because of the uncertainties associated with assessing preparedness of suppliers  there is a risk of a material adverse effect on carpenter s future results of operations if these constituencies are not capable of correcting their year issues 
carpenter has contacted and is continuing to monitor the progress of all suppliers determined to be mission critical 
all suppliers who have responded indicated that they will be able to provide their products or services to carpenter with no interruptions 
contingency plans are currently being developed for these suppliers to prepare for a possible unexpected outage 
carpenter has a very large  diverse customer base with thousands of customers 
no customer represents more than percent of carpenter s net sales 
however  carpenter has assessed the state of readiness of its major customers to determine if there will be any significant loss of business due to the year computer issues and has not found any major customer who is not actively addressing the issues on a timely basis 
carpenter hired an independent consultant to perform a status study of its year efforts in march this review resulted in several recommendations to improve the project effectiveness 
the recommendations have been reviewed with management and appropriate actions have been taken 
costs to address carpenter s year issues the following is a summary of past and expected future costs to remediate carpenter s year issues fiscal fiscal fiscal estimated fiscal in millions costs costs costs costs total costs charged to income before taxes a 

capitalized software and hardware b total year costs a the majority of these costs were for outside consultants and programmers  were in addition to the normal budget for information systems  and were paid currently
