item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
general the company is a holding company whose subsidiaries own and or operate short line and regional freight railroads and provide related rail services in the united states  australia and mexico 
the company  through its us industrial switching subsidiary  also provides freight car switching and related services to united states industries with extensive railroad facilities within their complexes 
the company generates revenues primarily from the movement of freight over track owned or operated by its railroads 
the company also generates non freight revenues primarily by providing freight car switching and related rail services such as railcar leasing  railcar repair and storage to industries with extensive railroad facilities within their complexes  to shippers along its lines  and to the class i railroads that connect with its us lines 
the company s operating expenses include wages and benefits  equipment rents including car hire  purchased services  depreciation and amortization  diesel fuel  casualties and insurance  materials and other expenses 
car hire is a charge paid by a railroad to the owners of railcars used by that railroad in moving freight 
other expenses generally include property and other non income taxes  professional services  communication and data processing costs and general overhead expense 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one reporting period to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
the company has historically experienced fluctuations in revenues and expenses such as one time freight moves  customer plant expansions and shut downs  railcar sales  accidents and derailments 
in periods when these events occur  results of operations are not easily comparable to other periods 
also  much of the company s growth to date has resulted from acquisitions 
the company completed two acquisitions during the first four months of  one in november  and another in november because of variations in the structure  timing and size of these acquisitions and differences in economics among the company s railroads resulting from differences in the rates and other material terms established through negotiation  the company s results of operations in any reporting period may not be directly comparable to its results of operations in other reporting periods

the company invested million in track and other fixed assets apart from its investment in the illinois midland  pittsburg shawmut and rail link acquisitions see note to consolidated financial statements 
in october   the company amended and restated its credit facilities agreement to provide for a million revolving credit facility 
the facility has a maturity date of october  the credit facilities accrue interest at prime or the eurodollar rate  at the option of the company  plus the applicable margin  which varies from to depending upon the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio  as defined in the agreement 
interest is payable in arrears based on certain elections of the company  not to exceed three months outstanding 
the company pays a commitment fee which varies between and per annum on all unused portions of the revolving credit facility depending on the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
the credit facilities agreement requires mandatory prepayments from the issuance of new equity or debt and annual sale of assets in excess of million 
these credit facilities are guaranteed by all domestic subsidiaries of the company and contain a negative pledge of assets 
the credit facilities agreement requires the maintenance of certain covenants  including  but not limited to  funded debt to ebitda  cash flow coverage and ebitda less defined capital expenditures to interest expense  all as defined in the agreement 
in september   certain covenants of the credit facilities agreement regarding consolidated cash flow  investments and capital expenditures were amended  and a consent to stock repurchase program see note to consolidated financial statements was incorporated into the credit facilities agreement 
the company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the provisions of these covenants as of december  at december  the company had long term debt including current portion totaling million  which comprised of its total capitalization 
this compares to long term debt  including current portion  of million at december   comprising of total capitalization 
the company s railroads have entered into a number of rehabilitation grants with state and federal agencies 
the grant funds are used as a supplement to the company s normal capital programs 
in return for the grants  the railroads pledge to maintain various levels of service and maintenance on the rail lines that have been rehabilitated 
the company believes that the levels of service and maintenance required under the grants are not materially different from those that would be required without the grant obligation 
while the company has benefited in recent years from these grant funds  there can be no assurance that the funds will continue to be available 
the company has budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily for track rehabilitation  of which million is expected to be funded by rehabilitation grants from state and federal agencies to several of the company s railroads  and million is expected to be used in australia 
in connection with the company s acquisition of assets in australia see note to consolidated financial statements  the company has committed to the commonwealth of australia to spend approximately million au million to rehabilitate track structures and equipment by december  the commonwealth government may require the payment of any shortfall between the actual expenditure incurred from the date of acquisition to december   and the contracted commitment of approximately million au million 
this commitment may be renegotiated if there is a significant change in operating conditions outside the control of the company 
the company has historically relied primarily on cash generated from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures relating to ongoing operations  while relying on borrowed funds to finance acquisitions and equipment needs primarily rolling stock related to acquisitions 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations together with amounts available under the credit facilities will enable the company to meet its liquidity and capital expenditure requirements relating to ongoing operations for at least the duration of the credit facilities 
year compliance in late  the company began a comprehensive initiative to address and resolve potential exposure associated with the functioning of its information systems and non information technology systems that include embedded technology with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
this initiative led to the development of the gwi year project handbook 
the handbook was developed to report industry year methods and standards  and document best practices for each of the company s subsidiaries 
its purpose is to promote consistent implementation of the year project and encourage cost effective practices and efficient use of resources 
the year project handbook contains information useful to managers  system analysts  and other technical staff members  including consultants and business partners 
it is meant to be used as a reference throughout the year design  modification  testing  and implementation phases 
the handbook addresses most of the obstacles the company may face and their potential solutions  including project management issues  contracting and staffing  interface and data exchange standards  and test and development methodologies 
three major categories of systems addressed by the company s year initiative are railroad operations management systems  business systems and non information technology systems 
all of the company s railroad operations and management processes are supported through licensed third party development and contracted operations 
these systems are third party certified year compliant 
with respect to electronic commerce transmissions  the company is currently capable of supporting certain year compliant edi transactions 
remaining year compliant edi transactions will be implemented according to railroad industry wide schedules 
full edi compliance is expected during the second quarter of because the potential exists that not all of the company s trading partners will achieve year compliance  the company s operational systems will accommodate non year electronic commerce transmissions as well as year ready transmissions 
all of the company s financial  purchasing  inventory  asset management  payroll and human resource systems supporting business operations are third party systems 
the third party vendors have certified all packages to be year compliant 
with respect to non information technology systems that may impact operations and or business processes  the company has conducted initial assessments of its rail yard and office facilities and found no major year problems or obstacles 
as part of its year initiative  the company is in communication with its interline carriers  significant suppliers  large customers and financial institutions to assess their year readiness and expects to conduct interface tests with its external trading partners in upon completion of internal testing of remediated applications 
to date  the company has expended less than  on its year initiative and remaining costs are expected to be minimal 
overall  the company s year initiative is proceeding on schedule with completion of all areas expected by mid failure to achieve year compliance by the company  other railroads  its suppliers  and its customers could negatively affect the company s ability to conduct business for an extended period 
management believes that the company will be successful in its year conversion  however  there can be no assurance that other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis  and such failure could have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates applies to its borrowings under a credit facility and a capital lease arrangement  both of which have variable interest rates tied to the libor rate 
in addition  the company s australian subsidiary has a variable rate loan  one half of which fluctuates with market changes in interest rates and one half of which is fixed at
