overview the company was organized in november as a delaware corporation and remains a development stage enterprise 
e 
khashoggi industries llc  the company s principal stockholder  or its predecessors eki  has been involved since july in the development of various new material technologies including the new composite material 
the company was formed to develop  license and commercialize foodservice disposables made of earthshell composite material earthshell products 
the company has an exclusive  worldwide  royalty free license from eki to use certain technology for this purpose 
the company intends to continue to license or joint venture with existing manufacturers of foodservice disposables for the manufacture and distribution of earthshell products 
the company expects to derive revenues primarily from license royalties and distributions from joint ventures that are licensed to manufacture earthshell products 
the company has experienced aggregate net losses of approximately million from its inception on november  through december  the company has been unprofitable to date and expects to continue to incur operating losses until its products are commercially introduced and achieve broader market acceptance and market penetration 
since its inception  the company has not generated any revenues from operations 
successful future operations will depend upon the ability of the company  its licensees and joint venture partners to commercialize multiple earthshell products 
prior to the company s initial public offering in march  in which the company raised net proceeds of million  the company financed its operations from inception primarily through the private placement of preferred stock and loans from its principal stockholder  eki  and imperial bank 
since inception  the company has relied on eki to provide extensive management and technical support 
the company and eki entered into an amended and restated technical services and sublease agreement the technical services agreement which continues through december  under the terms of the technical services agreement  the company pays eki for all direct project labor hours incurred by eki technical personnel and direct expenses incurred on approved projects 
in addition  under an amended and restated agreement for the allocation of patent costs the patent agreement  the company reimburses eki for the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting  acquiring and maintaining certain patents and patent applications relating to the technology licensed to the company under an amended and restated license agreement the license agreement 
development of first commercial manufacturing facility 
one of the company s licensees  sweetheart cup company inc sweetheart  has secured a contract with perseco mcdonald s corporation s primary packaging purchasing agent  to supply mcdonald s us restaurants with a minimum of billion big mac registered trademark sandwich containers made from earthshell products over a three year period  representing the initial commercial application of earthshell products 
to support this initial commercial earthshell application  earthshell agreed with sweetheart to provide manufacturing equipment to sweetheart with adequate capacity to fulfill the perseco mcdonald s order 
in cooperation with sweetheart  the company engaged the food group  a division of chm hill  to provide detailed engineering  procurement and construction management services relating to the installation of three commercial sandwich container production lines at sweetheart s owings mills  maryland facility 
these lines have been designed to enable sweetheart to produce big mac registered trademark sandwich containers in sufficient quantities to fulfill sweetheart s supply agreement with perseco 
the development and installation of equipment lines at this facility has been the company s major focus since sweetheart secured the perseco supply agreement relating to big mac registered trademark sandwich containers in october as of december   the company had begun start up and debugging of its lines 
as the owings mills facility is the first commercial implementation of the earthshell technology  the company believes that the cost incurred on these first lines is significantly higher than the cost of subsequent lines 
at the time of the initial public offering  the company estimated that the cost associated with the initial installation at sweetheart  including approximately million in costs estimated for initial development and engineering of commercial production capability  would be between million and million 
management now estimates that the capitalized cost of the first three lines will be approximately million upon completion 
in addition  the company expects to expense approximately million of process development  design and engineering costs related to these lines 
the company also anticipates incurring approximately million of capitalized costs associated with future lines at owings mills 
in addition  the company expects to incur approximately million in start up and debugging expense associated with preparing the manufacturing lines for full scale production 
the company believes a significant portion of the incremental capitalized cost of the sweetheart installation is non recurring 
these non recurring costs include portions of plant engineering and design costs  oversizing of system components to allow for margins of safety or capacity  installation of instrumentation and monitoring equipment to provide input for future value engineering  and premiums paid on component equipment for first time  single item purchases 
the company believes these factors largely account for the higher than anticipated capital cost of its first commercial manufacturing lines 
the company also believes manufacturing process design and development expenses will be reduced in future sites 
based on internal analysis  which has been supported by external engineering studies  the company believes that the relationship between capital cost and the level of revenue dollars that are generated by its licensees or joint venture partners will meet and potentially be more favorable than industry norms 
the company intends to prove this through the development of pilot lines on a commercial scale prior to making its next tier plant investments 
based on its initial results during the debugging of the first manufacturing lines  the company believes that the first three commercial lines will meet the total throughput specified in the original four line design basis  and will meet the requirements of its first customer  mcdonald s 
the company is confident that an agreement can be reached with sweetheart to build additional lines at the owings mills site  should the company desire to do so 
other customers and licensees 
in addition to its agreement with sweetheart  the company is engaged in discussions with additional converters for the creation of new licensing or joint venture agreements to further commercialize its technology 
in october  the company announced that it had signed a non binding letter of intent to establish a joint venture to commercialize earthshell products throughout europe  australia  new zealand  and asia except japan as determined on a country by country basis  with huhtamaki oyj huhtamaki  a leading international food and food packaging firm headquartered in finland which commands leading market shares in europe  australia  and significant positions in several asian markets 
the company also announced in november that it had signed a non binding letter of intent with prairie packaging  inc prairie to produce an array of products 
the proposed arrangement encompasses the production of plates  hinged lid containers and cups  initially to be sold to sysco corporation  the leading foodservice distributor in north america 
based on these letters of intent  the company has initiated engineering design work for the next commercial installations that will manufacture a broadened commercial product set 
although discussions leading to definitive agreements have begun  no assurances can be given that these non binding letters of intent will result in definitive agreements with either huhtamaki or prairie 
transition activities in preparation for manufacturing ramp up 
the company is transitioning from being a development stage company primarily engaged in product development to a company engaged in licensing and supporting the commercial implementation of its technology 
concurrent with the development of the first commercial earthshell production facility and in response to anticipated market demand  the company is planning and preparing for rapid growth 
during  the company hired several senior executives to expand core competencies and fill critical ongoing positions  including william f 
mclaughlin  president and chief operating officer  william f 
spengler  senior vice president and chief financial officer  vincent j 
truant  vice president of marketing  environmental affairs and public relations  and michael m 
hagerty  vice president and chief technology officer 
these hirings reflect the company s intensified efforts to build a highly experienced management team to execute the company s strategy and enhance the creation of shareholder value 
to better address and service the geographical concentration of the company s initial and anticipated commercial activities and to minimize projected operating costs  the company s corporate headquarters has been relocated from santa barbara  california to baltimore  maryland 
accordingly  the company has entered into a long term lease for office space in downtown baltimore where the company s senior management team is located 
the company has also decided to move its product development center to the baltimore region to be closer to the company s headquarters 
basic research activities  which will continue to be supported by the eki technical staff  will remain in the santa barbara  california area 
during  the company also concluded a strategic business plan review with the boston consulting group and further developed its strategy to exploit its foodservice disposable technology on a global basis

the company completed its development efforts with genpak near the end of and relocated the pilot line to santa barbara  california in the fourth quarter of and  accordingly  costs related to this off site manufacturing effort were not incurred during total general and administrative expenses 
total general and administrative expenses increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the recognition of compensation expense of million resulting from the extension of the terms of certain option agreements in october that have been deemed as re grants and  therefore  have been treated as stock options granted at prices below market 
similarly in  the company recognized compensation expense of million related to executive stock options 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expense was mainly a result of the purchase of pilot manufacturing equipment formerly located at the genpak  rock hill  south carolina facility for the company s santa barbara product development center 
related party patent expenses 
legal fees under the prior patent agreement and the patent agreement with eki decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of filing fewer new patent applications 
interest income expenses  net 
total interest expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense during was due to additional borrowings from eki and additional borrowings against the company s line of credit 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company s net loss increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses 
total research and development expenditures for the development of earthshell products increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  compared to  was primarily due to the company s development manufacturing efforts on the earthshell sandwich container pilot line at the genpak research facility in south carolina and its relocation near the end of to santa barbara 
in addition  in preparation for the company s initial public offering  the company increased its efforts in the environmental science and marketing areas related to the earthshell sandwich container resulting in increased expenses from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company was billed by eki for research and development services totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total general and administrative expenses 
total general and administrative expenses increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the recognition of compensation expense of million related to one executive s stock options that vested during  a severance payment of million and legal and filing fees related to the company s initial public offering of million 
depreciation and amortization

legal fees under the prior patent agreement with eki decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of filing fewer patent applications 
interest income expenses  net 
total interest expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due to additional borrowings from eki of million and borrowings against the line of credit of million for the year ended december  due to the reduction of excess cash for investment purposes in  interest income decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december  as part of the company s initial public offering on march   the company issued  shares of its common stock  
par value  for which the company received net proceeds of million 
the company has used million of the net proceeds through december  a portion of the proceeds was used to repay indebtedness to the majority stockholder of million  bank debt of million and to pay accrued dividends on the company s series a preferred stock of million 
the remaining proceeds are anticipated to be used to i facilitate the development of manufacturing capacity for the company s products by engineering  developing and constructing manufacturing lines for licensees or joint ventures  ii expand the earthshell product development center  iii launch an initial public relations and advertising campaign  and iv for general corporate purposes  including the employment of additional personnel  the continued design and development of earthshell products and anticipated operating losses 
as of december  the company had cash and short term investments totaling million 
net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

subsequent to december   and prior to the public offering in march  the company borrowed an additional million and million from its majority stockholder and its credit line bank  respectively 
these additional borrowings were repaid from the proceeds of the initial public offering 
the company believes that it is not dependent on third party financing to meet its operating and working capital needs through december   exclusive of plant manufacturing activities 
the company intends to use third party financing in the development of its next commercial manufacturing plants 
the company intends to prove its manufacturing economics using pilot lines before soliciting such third party financing and prior to making its next plant investments 
based on the anticipated results of the pilot line activity  the company plans to commence construction of its next two plants in the second half of the company believes  contingent on securing third party financing  that it has sufficient capital resources to meet its operating and working capital needs and to fully construct its next two facilities in the company has no commitments for any additional financing  and there can be no assurance that any such commitments can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
if the company is unable to obtain additional financing as needed after demonstrating the commercial viability of its manufacturing process  the company may be required to reduce the scope of its anticipated manufacturing ramp up and product introductions  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
year compliance the company is currently reviewing its business operations to minimize the risk of potential disruption from the year issue 
this problem is a result of computer programs having been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any information systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations and system failures 
the problem also extends to many non information technology systems  that is  operating and control systems that rely on embedded chips systems 
for the purposes of this discussion  year compatible means that the computer hardware  software or device in question will function in without modification or adjustment or will function in with a one time manual adjustment 
however  there can be no assurance that any such year compatible hardware  software or device will function properly when interacting with any year non compatible hardware  software or device 
the company does not rely on any internally developed software to run its systems 
the company has received documentation from its major vendors asserting that equipment and software in use for its sweetheart operations  accounting  payroll and phone systems is year compliant 
additionally  the company contractually requires that manufacturing equipment suppliers deliver equipment that is year compliant 
based on documented vendor assertions and company contractual requirements  the company believes that the cost of completing any internal modifications necessary to become year compliant will not be material 
the company has spent minimal amounts to date to become year compliant since major purchases for hardware  software and devices were deemed to be year compliant by the company s vendors 
the company has not formally tested each vendor s assertion and plans to do this testing for its major systems before the end of there can be no assurances that each vendor s claim to be year compliant will ultimately be true and the company is unable to estimate the cost to become year compliant  if a vendor s assertion proves to be incorrect 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in or failure of certain normal business activities or operations of the company including the ability to produce earthshell products 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that both its major information technology systems and non information technology systems are year compliant 
the company believes that the areas that present the greatest risk to the company are i disruption of the company s business due to year non compatibility of one of its critical business systems and ii disruption of the business of certain of its significant customers and vendors due to their non compliance 
whether disruption of a customer s or vendor s business due to non compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company will depend on several factors including the nature and duration of the disruption  the significance of the customer or vendor and  in the case of vendors  the availability of alternate sources for the vendor s products 
the company does not currently have a contingency plan  but is considering the development of such a plan to address year non compliance issues 
readers are cautioned that the preceding discussion contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement notice appearing at the beginning of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
expectations about future year related costs and the progress of the company s year efforts are subject to various uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations  including i the success of the company in identifying hardware  software and devices that are not year compatible  ii the nature and amount of remediation required to make them compatible  iii the availability  rate and amount or related labor and consulting costs and iv the success of the company s significant vendors and customers in addressing their year issues 
net operating loss tax carryforwards the company has sustained net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes in the aggregate amount of approximately million from its inception on november  through december  under the internal revenue code of  as amended  the company generally is entitled to reduce its future federal income tax liabilities by carrying unused nols forward for a period of years to offset future taxable income earned 
in the event that the company is subject to the federal personal holding company tax in any taxable year  the company can only use its nols  if any  from the immediately preceding taxable year to offset its income subject to the personal holding company tax for such year
