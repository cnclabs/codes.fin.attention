readers are cautioned that such information involves risks and uncertainties  including those created by general market conditions  competition and the possibility that events may occur which limit the ability of the company to maintain or improve its operating results or execute its primary growth strategy of acquiring additional printing businesses 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and there can therefore be no assurance that the forward looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate 
the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 
general the company s sales are derived primarily from the production and sale of customized printed materials by its printing businesses 
the company s printing businesses provide a full range of traditional printing services  complemented at certain locations by a variety of electronic communication and fulfillment services  for many different types of customers  including national and local corporations  mutual fund companies  advertising agencies  graphic design firms  catalog retailers and direct mail distributors 
the company s traditional printing services encompass electronic prepress  printing  finishing  storage and delivery of documents and other products requested by its customers and produced to their specifications 
examples of such products include high quality  multicolor product and capability brochures  shareholder communications  catalogs  reference materials  training manuals and direct mail pieces 
many of the company s printing businesses utilize their advanced technological capabilities to offer their customers additional services  such as archiving  re purposing and distributing digital data  cd rom and internet publishing and webpage design 
fulfillment services consist of storing customer materials primarily printed products and providing just in time assembly and distribution of customized documents to customers or other designated destinations 
orders for fulfillment services are frequently received from customers online via the internet or through order entry and inventory management systems maintained by the company 
each printing business has its own sales  estimating  customer service  prepress  production  postpress and accounting departments 
the company s headquarters supports its printing businesses in such areas as human resources  purchasing and management information systems  and maintains centralized risk management  treasury  investor relations and consolidated financial reporting activities 
the company s strategy is to generate growth in sales and profits through an aggressive acquisition program  coupled with internal growth and operational improvements at its existing businesses 
the company provides its acquired businesses cost savings through master purchasing arrangements  access to technology and capital  strategic counsel and a commitment to training through a unique  comprehensive management development program 
as a result  operating income margins and efficiencies of newly acquired businesses  which may be lower than those being achieved by the company s other businesses  typically improve as the company s operating strengths and strategies are fully implemented 
the company s consolidated financial results in a given period may be affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions 
the company s consolidated operating income margins in the periods following a significant acquisition or series of acquisitions may be lower than historically reported consolidated margins depending on how quickly and to what extent an acquired business is able to adapt to and implement the company s management practices 
the company s printing businesses compete primarily in the general commercial printing sector  which is characterized by individual orders from customers for customized printing projects rather than long term contracts 
continued engagement for successive jobs is dependent upon  among other things  the customer s satisfaction with the services provided 
as such  the company is unable to predict  for more than a few weeks in advance  the number  size and profitability of printing jobs it expects to produce 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s historical income statements and certain percentage relationships for the periods indicated as a percentage of sales year ended march year ended march in millions sales cost of sales gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes income taxes net income acquisitions in fiscal  and are the primary causes of the absolute increases in revenues and expenses each year since fiscal each of the company s acquisitions in fiscal  and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  accordingly  the company s consolidated income statements reflect revenues and expenses of acquired businesses only for post acquisition periods 
in each fiscal year shown above  acquisitions affected the company s consolidated financial results  when compared to the prior fiscal year  for the portion of the year following their respective dates of acquisition 
similarly  acquisitions in each fiscal year affected the company s consolidated financial results in the fiscal years which followed their respective year of acquisition because the acquired businesses were under the company s ownership for a full fiscal year

gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in because the combined operating margins of the acquired businesses  which contributed a substantial portion of the company s total sales  were lower than the company s consolidated operating margin in as discussed above  the company expects that gross profit margins at recently acquired businesses will be lower than the company s historical margins  then likely improve as the full benefit of the company s operating strengths and strategies takes effect 
selling expenses increased to million in from million in due to the increased sales levels noted above 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly to in from in due primarily to higher selling costs incurred at newly acquired businesses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase is due to the addition of the acquired businesses and  to a lesser extent  an increase in headquarters staffing and related costs 
the additional headquarters costs were incurred to enable the company to maximize the operating efficiencies available to it as a result of its growth 
due to these incremental costs  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly to in from in interest expense increased to million in from million in primarily due to a net increase in borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit facility used to finance the purchase of the acquisitions 
effective income tax rates reflect an increase to in from in due to a combination of factors  including the acquisition of businesses in states with proportionately higher income tax rates  the effect of nondeductible goodwill incurred in connection with certain acquisitions and an increase in the company s effective marginal federal income tax rate

selling expenses increased to million in from million in due to the increased sales levels discussed above 
selling expenses as a percentage of sales improved to in from in this improvement reflects a lower average commission percentage incurred by the acquired businesses as compared to the company s historical percentage and an increase in non commissioned sales at certain locations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to the addition of the acquired businesses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales improved to in from in this improvement is due to the previously mentioned increase in sales exceeding the increase in the amount of overhead expenses necessary to support such additional sales  and also reflects the company s ongoing efficiency initiatives 
interest expense increased to million in from million in due to a net increase in borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility to finance  in part  the cash portions of the purchase price of the acquired businesses 
effective income tax rates increased to in from in due to the company s continued growth by acquisition in states with higher income tax rates than those states in which the company previously operated 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s primary cash uses are for acquisitions  capital expenditures and payments on long term debt incurred to finance certain equipment purchases or assumed in connection with certain acquisitions 
cash utilized to complete acquisitions totaled million in  million in and million in cash utilized for capital expenditures  which relate primarily to the purchase of new equipment  was million in  million in and million in payments on long term debt were million in  million in and million in in total  cash requirements for acquisitions  capital expenditures and debt service were million in  million in and million in the company financed its capital requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under its revolving credit facility see below

million  million and million in  and capital resources in june  the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement  which was amended in august to increase the facility to million as amended  the credit agreement  with a nine member banking group following the amendment 
loans outstanding under the credit agreement are unsecured and accrue interest  at the company s option  at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
to based upon the company s debt to pro forma ebitda ratio as defined  redetermined quarterly  or an alternate base rate based upon the bank s prime lending rate or federal funds effective rate 
the credit agreement also provides for a commitment fee on available but unused amounts ranging from 
to 
per annum 
the credit agreement matures on july   at which time all amounts outstanding thereunder are due 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement were million and were subject to an average interest rate of per annum 
the company is subject to certain covenants and restrictions and must meet certain financial tests pursuant to and as defined in the credit agreement 
the company believes that these restrictions do not adversely affect its acquisition or operating strategies  and that it was in compliance with such financial tests and other covenants at march  the company has agreements with certain printing press manufacturers collectively  the press purchase agreements  pursuant to which the company receives certain volume purchase incentives and long term financing options with respect to the purchase of printing presses 
as of march   the company was obligated on term notes related to the press purchase agreements totaling million 
these term notes provide for fixed monthly principal and interest payments through at an average interest rate of  and are secured by the purchased presses 
the company is not subject to any significant financial covenants or restrictions in connection with these obligations 
as of march   the company had accepted delivery of additional printing presses for a total purchase price of million  which amount is included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is expected to be financed under the press purchase agreements 
the company expects to make additional equipment capital expenditures in fiscal using cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit agreement and or the press purchase agreements 
the company s remaining debt obligations generally consist of mortgages  capital leases  promissory notes  industrial revenue bonds and a million auxiliary revolving credit agreement  some of which contain financial covenants and restrictions 
the most significant of these place certain restrictions on future borrowings and acquisitions above specified levels 
the company believes these restrictions do not adversely affect its acquisition or operating strategies 
pursuant to earnout agreements entered into in connection with certain acquisitions  as of march   the company was contingently obligated at certain times and under certain circumstances through to issue up to  shares of its common stock and make additional cash payments of up to million for all periods in the aggregate 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company acquired printing businesses 
to complete these acquisitions  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million  issued  shares of its common stock  and discharged debt of the acquired businesses totaling million 
as of may   the company had completed two additional acquisitions and had executed two non binding letters of intent and one binding definitive agreement to acquire a total of three other printing businesses 
the company intends to continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities  utilizing cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement or the issuance of its common stock 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire additional businesses on acceptable terms in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to establish  maintain or increase the profitability of any acquired business 
year the year issue results from the historical use in computer software programs of a two digit abbreviation in date fields to represent the year 
certain computer programs  including programs imbedded in various equipment  may fail to properly function when confronted with dates which contain the two digit year 
these processing errors have the potential to cause system failures or disrupt normal operations 
the company has reviewed and is continuing to review its business risks associated with the year issue 
it has established a year readiness program and a year readiness team with the responsibility for its execution 
the year readiness team initially developed a schedule for evaluating the company s information technology assets and conducting risk reviews of non information technology assets and operational practices 
the evaluation of the company s information technology assets  including its management information systems and equipment used in its printing operations  is substantially complete with certain necessary upgrades  conversions or replacements having been made or currently in process 
the company is now proceeding with the testing and validation phase of its year readiness program with respect to its information technology assets 
the targeted completion date for this phase is september although no assurances can be given  the company does not believe it will suffer any material disruptions to its operations as a result of the impact of the year issue on its information technology assets 
because the majority of its management information systems operate on broadly available hardware platforms and employ software specifically designed for the printing industry and perpetually supported by its developers  the company has not encountered any significant difficulty in completing the portions of its year readiness program pertaining to its information technology assets  nor has it had to accelerate the replacement or upgrade of  or incur costs materially in excess of its recurring investment in  its management information systems 
the company s year readiness team is in the process of evaluating the company s exposure to business disruptions as a result of the impact of the year issue on its non information technology assets  operational policies  and major suppliers and customers 
the company expects to complete this phase of its year readiness program by september like many manufacturing companies  the company s operations depend upon the operation of many other businesses  the disruption of any one or even a number of which as a result of the year issue would not have a material effect on the business of the company 
however  in a worst case year scenario  a significant number of such businesses could suffer disruptions as a result of the year issue and the company s operations could be adversely affected 
in the case of a systemic failure  such as prolonged telecommunications or electrical failures  or a general disruption in united states or global business activities that could result in a significant econommic downturn  the primary business risks of the company would include  but not be limited to  loss of customers or orders  increased operating costs  inability to obtain supplies and inventory on a timely basis  disruptions in product shipments or other business interruptions of a material nature  any of which could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a prolonged industry wide decline in printing orders as affected businesses focus on operational requirements more essential to their survival than printing needs would have a significant adverse effect on the company 
in addition  although the company is not aware of any contractual relationship it has which exposes the company to any potentially material liability in the event the company suffers a business disruption as a result of the year issue  it is possible that claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation or breach of contract could nevertheless be made against the company 
there are many suppliers of paper  ink and other materials used in printing operations 
thus  the company believes that it is not materially dependent on any one supplier 
the company s year readiness team has orally communicated with  and in some cases received written communications from  many of the company s more significant suppliers regarding such supplier s year readiness and is evaluating the need for written confirmation  solicitation or other action with respect to such information 
however  based on communications made or received to date  the company believes that it will be able to obtain materials necessary to continue its operations without significant disruption due to year issues 
the company has a large and diversified customer base comprised of thousands of customers in locations throughout the united states and is not dependent on any one customer or group of customers for its revenues 
as such  the company does not anticipate that the demand for its commercial printing services would be materially adversely affected as a result of year issues unless such issues have a widespread  catastrophic effect on its customer base 
the primary thrust of the company s year readiness program with respect to minimizing business disruptions as a result of the impact of the year issue on its non information technology assets  operational policies  all major suppliers and customers  including with respect to the worst case scenario described above  will be the development of contingency plans  to the extent feasible 
because of its many locations  if certain of its printing facilities were to be adversely affected  the company could likely use other operable printing facilities 
accordingly  the company expects that its primary contingency plans will focus on the re distribution of customer projects from inoperable to operable facilities in order to mitigate  to the extent possible  the effect of any business disruption 
the company expects to develop these contingency plans after completion of the evaluation phase currently in process 
as part of its ongoing review of the year issue  the company evaluates and addresses year issues for its planned acquisitions and develops appropriate remedial action and a timetable for such action following completion of such acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk generally means the risk that losses may occur in the value of certain financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company does not hold or utilize derivative financial instruments which could expose the company to significant market risk 
however  the company is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to its long term debt obligations 
the company s long term debt obligations as of march  include borrowings under the credit agreement totaling million  various term equipment notes of million and other debt obligations totaling million see liquidity and capital resources
