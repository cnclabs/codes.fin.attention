overview security first technologies corporation  commonly known as s  develops integrated  brandable internet applications that enable companies offering financial services to create their own financial portals 
prior to september   we were the technology subsidiary of security first network bank  which was the first internet bank 
on september   we completed a reorganization to separate our banking and technology businesses  and then sold the banking business to a subsidiary of royal bank of canada 
s developed the technology which enabled security first network bank to begin offering banking services over the internet 
we released version of our product in and intend to continue our product development efforts  which include the introduction of version within the next months 
revenues s s revenues are derived primarily from three sources software licenses 
s receives license fees from direct licensees of virtual financial manager and third party data processors 
direct licensees install and operate virtual financial manager in their own data center 
s generally receives an initial license fee plus ongoing fees which are based on either the number of end users or a percentage of the initial license fee 
the initial software license fees are generally recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over either the term of the agreement or  for contracts without a term  the estimated useful life of the software products 
the ongoing fees are recognized as revenue in the month earned 
third party data processors install virtual financial manager in their own data processing centers and license the product to their client institutions  typically smaller financial services entities like community banks and thrifts 
s receives monthly fees from third party data processors based on the total number of end users served by the processors client institutions 
these fees are recognized as revenue in the period earned 
professional services 
s provides professional services related to the installation and integration of virtual financial manager 
these services include installing the product at direct licensees and third party data processing centers  integrating the financial institution s data processing systems with the s data center for data center clients  product enhancements  consulting  and training 
customers are charged and revenues are recognized for these services primarily on a time and materials basis 
these revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
data center 
s receives recurring monthly fees from financial institutions who have chosen to license s s virtual financial manager and outsource the processing of their financial transactions to the s data center 
in addition  s receives monthly fees for technical support 
these fees are based on the number of end users of the client institution 
these revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
expenses s expects to continue making significant investments in product development in order to enhance its existing products  develop new products and further advance its technology 
for example  s plans to introduce version of virtual financial manager within the next months  which will  among other things  increase the product s scalability and allow it to be customized for international use by s s clients 
future expenditures in product development will be primarily attributable to the addition of software development personnel with the technological and industry expertise relevant to s s technology 
s expects to increase its sales and marketing efforts to expand its customer base 
the sales and marketing staff  which numbered at december   is expected to grow significantly during s also will continue to promote its products and services through conferences  seminars  direct marketing and trade publications 
s records software development costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
s currently does not have any capitalized software development costs 
s has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  with expiration dates beginning in the year and ending in the year of this amount  million related to stock option tax deductions which will be reflected as additional paid in capital when realized 
s has incurred annual and quarterly losses from operations since its inception 
at december   s had an accumulated deficit of million 
moreover  although s s revenues have increased in recent periods  there can be no assurance that s s revenues will grow in future periods  that they will grow at past rates  that s will achieve profitability in the future or that  if profitability is achieved  it will be sustained 
client information the table below reflects information on the number of financial services entities that have either executed a letter of intent or contract to use the s software applications and technology segregated by distribution channel 
the table also shows information on the number of financial services entities for which virtual financial manager has been implemented by distribution channel 
data regarding third party data processors and direct software licensees are based on information provided by these companies since s does not have direct access to that data

the following table sets forth this data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues software licenses professional services data center total revenues direct costs software licenses professional services data center total direct costs operating expenses selling and marketing product development general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges total operating expenses  operating loss  interest income loss from continuing operations  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues s s total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
the primary components of revenue were million in software license fees  million in professional service fees and million in data center fees 
as a result of the size of the companies s does business with  the magnitude of the implementations for companies of this size and our limited amount of capacity to perform implementations  in any given period a significant portion of our revenues may be attributed to a limited number of clients 
software licenses 
software license fees increased by  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
software license fees represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  this increase in software license fees relates primarily to the recognition of revenue from the license fees included in the technology and licensing agreements with royal bank of canada 
these license fees have been recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue over a three year maintenance period 
in addition  the increase in is also attributed to a license for s s relationship management product 
professional services 
professional services revenues increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
professional services revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  this increase in professional services revenue in was driven by projects at a number of large financial services companies 
additionally  during  s began performing professional services related to product enhancement projects  which include the initial development of an insurance product  incorporation of broadvision s one to one marketing with virtual financial manager and the integration of a new bill payment provider 
also  in s was limited in the amount it could bill for professional services because of fixed pricing for implementation services contained in initial contracts 
the increase in revenue in is also attributable to increases in pass through costs related to implementations 
data center 
data center revenues increased by million to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
data center revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  this increase can be attributed to increased end user demand for s s internet financial applications  the initiation of minimum fees based on capacity requirements and increased maintenance fees 
the average quarterly revenue per billable end user increased to in the fourth quarter from in the fourth quarter management anticipates that the average quarterly revenue per billable end user will decrease as financial services entities increase the number of their customers using the product 
revenues associated with the data center are directly influenced by the number of financial services entities that are using virtual financial manager products through the s data center and the number of end users of these financial services entities 
during the month of december  the data center processed in excess of  internet accounts  representing approximately  end users 
this represents an increase of in the number of accounts processed from approximately  and an increase of in the number of end users from approximately  for the month of december direct costs direct costs increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
direct costs represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  software license costs 
direct software license costs consist primarily of the cost of third party software used in the virtual financial manager suite 
direct costs associated with software licenses decreased by million to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   a decrease of 
direct software license costs in consisted primarily of the cost of third party software used in relationship management  whereas direct software license costs in consisted primarily of the amortization of purchased technology 
this purchased technology included technology acquired in previous acquisitions and software development costs paid to a contractor in and these costs have been amortized using the straight line method over a period of three years  which is the amount representing the greater of the amortization using the straight line method or the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  s wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill and purchased technology associated with acquisitions after determining that there were minimal future cash flows expected to be derived from these intangible assets as discussed further below 
direct costs associated with software licenses represented of software license fees in the year ended december  compared to of software license fees in the year ended december  professional services costs 
direct professional services costs consist of primarily personnel and related infrastructure costs 
direct costs associated with professional services increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
in addition to increases in personnel  s experienced delays in early implementations of virtual financial manager  due to integration issues with clients legacy mainframe systems which resulted in increased implementation costs and loss accruals for some fixed fee contracts 
currently  s is in the process of converting all financial services entities to virtual financial manager version these conversions will require a significant portion of s s implementation resources  and consequently  management anticipates that professional services margins will decrease in the next few quarters  due both to the deployment of such resources and the potential discounting of services related to these implementations 
direct costs associated with professional services represented of professional services revenues in the year ended december  compared to of professional services revenues in the year ended december  data center costs 
direct data center costs consist of personnel and computer equipment costs 
direct costs associated with data center services increased by  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in direct data center costs is primarily attributable to the establishment of the basic infrastructure of personnel and equipment needed to process accounts for the growing number of end users of our financial services clients 
in an effort to contain data center costs  s ended its data center facilities management agreement with a third party 
s experienced cost savings of approximately  in the fourth quarter of from both the elimination of the cost plus arrangement and the ability to use more efficiently the existing infrastructure 
as a result of the termination of this agreement  two financial institutions  which had a limited number of end users using the data center  elected not to enter into data center contracts with s since these institutions were relatively inactive  management does not anticipate this to have a significant impact on revenues 
based on current costs  management anticipates that the data center will reach a break even gross margin when approximately  end users are processed on a monthly basis 
direct data center costs represented of data center revenues in the year ended december  compared to  of data center revenues in the year ended december  see note to s s consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
selling and marketing expenses were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in the provision for uncollected receivables as a result of the increased revenues in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was due to s s ability to leverage its relatively fixed selling and marketing expenses over a larger revenue base 
product development 
product development expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
product development expenses were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the dollar increase relates primarily to an increase in personnel expenses for additional product development initiatives 
during  s completed the development of virtual financial manager version which will provide operational efficiencies and improve the stability of the core product 
s will be consolidating all existing clients on this version of the software by the third quarter s added loan functionality to the banking module with this release which will allow end users to view loan balances and make loan payments 
in addition  during s released its investments product and its relationship management product  which integrates broadvision s one to one marketing suite of software products with virtual financial manager 
the increase in product development costs represents management s commitment to enhancing the current virtual financial manager products by migrating the existing products to more efficient software architecture and to developing new virtual financial manager applications 
the decrease as a percentage of s s total revenues in the year ended december  from the year ended december  resulted from its ability to leverage product development expenses over a larger revenue base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  a portion of the dollar increase is attributable to charges related to the termination of the facilities management agreement for the data center discussed in depreciation and amortization below 
in addition  general and administrative expenses for include a charge of approximately  for professional fees related to an unsuccessful transaction 
the remaining increase relates to the expanded personnel infrastructure to manage s s growth 
the decrease as a percentage of our total revenues in the year ended december  from the year ended december  resulted from our ability to leverage general and administrative expenses over a larger revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
depreciation and amortization expenses were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a one time charge of approximately million related to the termination of an outsourcing contract for the data center 
in addition  s wrote off computer equipment totaling approximately  as the result of a physical inventory performed in the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization related to increased technology purchases in as a result of s s growth 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges decreased  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   a decrease of 
amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  included in the amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges are one time charges of million for the write off of goodwill and purchased technology from previous acquisitions discussed further below 
excluding this charge in  amortization of goodwill increased million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase related to the amortization of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of solutions by design  inc in november year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  s acquired five paces  inc and secureware  inc 
both acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method and  accordingly  results of operations for the period from the date of acquisition through december  are included in the results 
revenues s s total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the primary components of revenue were million in software license fees  million in professional service fees and  in data center fees 
software licenses 
software license fees increased by million to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
software license fees represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  this increase in software license fees is attributable to the increase in in house installations during as compared to at the end of  four in house installations of virtual financial manager were substantially complete 
in addition  in august  s licensed virtual financial manager to four institutions for million 
these license fees have been recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized using the subscription method over a period of three years 
professional services 
professional services revenues increased by million to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
professional services revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  during  s completed the installation of virtual financial manager for six financial institutions in the s data center  one third party data processing center and four financial institutions operating their own data centers 
this compares to a total of two implementations completed during  both using the s data center 
data center 
data center revenues increased by  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
data center revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  at the end of  eight financial institutions were implemented in the s data center 
this compares to a total of two institutions implemented in the s data center at the end of during the month of december  the s data center processed in excess of  accounts representing approximately  end users 
typically there is a time lag between the completion of an implementation and the ramp up of end users by the financial institution 
as a result  over of the accounts processed during december were attributable to four of the eight institutions implemented at the end of direct costs direct costs increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
direct costs represented of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  software license costs 
direct costs associated with software licenses increased by approximately  to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
direct software license costs in and in consisted mainly of the amortization of purchased technology 
this purchased technology included technology acquired in previous acquisitions and software development costs paid to a contractor in and these costs have been amortized using the straight line method over a period of three years  which is the amount representing the greater of the amortization using the straight line method or the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  s wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill and purchased technology associated with acquisitions in after determining that there were minimal future cash flows expected to be derived from these intangible assets as discussed further below 
direct costs associated with software licenses represented of software license fees in the year ended december  compared to of software license fees in the year ended december  professional services costs 
direct costs associated with professional services increased by million to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
direct costs associated with professional services represented of professional service revenues in the year ended december  compared to of professional services revenues in the year ended december  the increase in direct costs in the year ended december  related to delays in implementations of virtual financial manager due to integration issues with institutions legacy mainframe systems which resulted in increased implementation costs and loss accruals for some fixed fee contracts 
in addition  the impact of the delays and contract provisions discussed above was experienced mostly during  as there were a greater number of implementations in than there were in data center costs 
direct costs associated with data center services increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in direct data center costs is primarily attributable to the establishment of the basic infrastructure of personnel and equipment needed to process accounts for the growing number of our financial services clients 
direct data center costs represented  of data center revenues in the year ended december  compared to  of data center revenues in the year ended december  operating expenses operating expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
selling and marketing expenses were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in sales and marketing personnel costs and an increase in general marketing and advertising expenditures to increase awareness of virtual financial manager products in the financial services community 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was due to s s rapid revenue growth from to product development 
product development expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
product development expenses were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the acquisitions of five paces  inc and secureware  inc 
resulted in an increase in product development expenses with the increase in personnel costs from the addition of these employees 
the increase in personnel costs was necessary as s was increasing its software development activities 
also during the fourth quarter of  s abandoned research and development efforts known as webtone after expending approximately  on this project in the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  s experienced significant growth since may the increase in general and administrative expenses is the result of the combination of having a full year of expense reflected in compared to approximately eight months in and increased personnel costs and staffing associated with supporting the increased staffing levels of s depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of 
depreciation and amortization expenses were of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  the dollar increase was due to the increase in computer equipment from expansion of s s operations 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges decreased million to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   a decrease of 
amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges were of total revenues in the year ended december  compared to of total revenues in the year ended december  included in the amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges are one time charges of million for the write off of goodwill and purchased technology from previous acquisitions discussed further below 
in addition  s recorded intangible assets and goodwill of approximately million from the acquisition of solutions by design  inc during  of which million was amortized during the fourth quarter of additionally  s has included  of nonrecurring charges associated with the solutions by design acquisition in amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges for these amounts represent the premium paid to solutions by design by s for services rendered during the fourth quarter of prior to the consummation of the acquisition 
included in the amortization of goodwill and acquisition charges are one time charges of million for acquired in process research and development related to acquisitions 
during the fourth quarter of  s made the strategic decision to refocus the resources which had been involved in the development and marketing of the network security products acquired from secureware towards the virtual financial manager suite of products and related services 
in addition  as a result of a significant re write of s s banking product  management did not anticipate that there would be significant future sales of the version acquired from five paces 
as a result  s wrote off the balance of the intangible assets from the secureware and five paces acquisitions 
in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions discussed above  million in goodwill and other intangible assets was recorded 
based on an evaluation of the intangibles acquired  a total of million was charged to the consolidated statement of operations immediately following the acquisitions as in process research and development 
management estimated that million of the purchase price of five paces and million of the purchase price for secureware represented purchased in process technology that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use at the dates of acquisition 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges in the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by identifying on going research and development projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established 
for five paces  these projects included virtual brokerage manager  currently referred to as investments  a new software product that assists with investments via the internet  virtual credit card manager  now referred to as credit card  an add on to virtual bank manager  now referred to as banking  which allows online monitoring of credit card balances  and banking  which represents an updated version of the existing software and features additional functionality 
secureware s projects in process included new releases of its existing products  hannah  a network security product designed to provide secure network communications through cryptography  troy  which is designed to provide virus prevention and software configuration control through cryptography  and securemail  a secure electronic e mail package which uses cryptography to encrypt e mail 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technologies into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a rate of return commensurate with the risks associated with the incomplete technologies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the purchased in process technologies into commercially viable products principally relate to the design  programming  testing  debugging  and documentation efforts typically required in order to produce commercially viable software programs with the intended functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
at the time of the acquisition  the estimated costs required to complete the in process technologies acquired from five paces were  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the estimated costs required to complete the in process technologies acquired from secureware  as of the date of its acquisition  were  in fiscal year the resulting net cash flows from the in process projects are based on s management s estimates of revenues  cost of sales  operating expenses  and income taxes 
additionally  net cash flows were adjusted to allow for a return on other assets employed by s  including net working capital  fixed assets  other intangible assets  and the current technology 
these estimates are based on the following assumptions 
the estimated revenues for the in process technology acquired from five paces were projected to grow from  in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the estimated revenues for the in process technology acquired from secureware were projected to grow from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year these projections are based upon management s experience with predecessor projects and industry expectations for similar  successor projects 
the gross margins anticipated in the appraisal reflected a sales mix that primarily consisted of direct license revenues 
since the appraisal was completed  a significant number of customers have decided to use the product through the s data center rather than license the product directly and use their own data processing environment 
accordingly  the weighted average gross margin for s has been less than originally anticipated due to the revenue streams being weighted toward lower margin data center revenues 
although the sales mix has shifted from the higher margin direct license revenues  the data center revenues are anticipated to be realized over a longer term 
therefore  management believes that the value of this revenue stream would support a similar value for the in process projects acquired from five paces 
for secureware  the projected revenues also included payment for consulting services associated with the installation  customization  and training for the in process products 
cost of sales and operating expenses were similarly based on management s experience with similar projects and consistent with historical financial results 
for five paces  management s expectations of rapid revenue growth in fiscal year and in fiscal year  along with projected cost stability once the in process products gained market acceptance  led to expectations of significant increases in profit margins in those years 
for secureware  management anticipated a relatively constant cost structure and profit margin over the expected life of the in process technology 
as of the acquisition dates  the acquired in process projects had not demonstrated technological or economic feasibility 
as a result  the attainability of the income projections provided by management is subject to three additional risk components which were factored into the value of each project 
the three risk factors considered were project risk  product risk  and market risk 
to assess risk  management rated each type of risk on a scale from very low to very high 
the ratings were then translated into probability percentages associated with each indicated level of uncertainty for each project 
the combination of the risk factors resulted in a downward adjustment to the value derived from an unadjusted discounted cash flow approach 
since the cash flows associated with the acquired in process research and development are due in part to the deployment of both tangible and intangible assets  a charge was applied to the projected cash flows to allow for a return on these other assets 
the returns charged on these other assets employed ranged from six to ten percent of their estimated fair values 
other assets employed include working capital  fixed assets  current software technology  and a work force in place 
as part of the acquisitions  s acquired existing products currently in use and marketed by the two acquired companies 
the core product for five paces was virtual financial manager  a suite of software products being designed to allow customers remote access to all aspects of their balance sheet via the internet or a dial up connection through their financial institution 
existing secureware products included the current versions of hannah  troy  and securemail 
the value of the acquired software technology was estimated through the income approach 
under this approach  the fair value is based on the present value of the expected income to be derived from the existing technology 
to determine the value under this approach  s developed an estimate of future revenues and costs applicable to the commercial exploitation of the current technology 
since the cash flows associated with the current technology are due in part to the deployment of other assets  a charge was applied to the projected cash flows to allow for a return on those assets 
the cash flows associated with the current products were then discounted to present value at a discount rate commensurate with the current product portfolio s level of risk 
once the value of the current technologies was determined  a capital charge for the use of these technologies was applied to the cash flows of the in process technologies 
this charge includes both a return on capital of  as well as a return of capital invested in the current technologies 
for secureware in process research and development  the discount rate used was 
for five paces  the discount rate applied to the in process technologies was 
several methods were considered for estimating the discount rate applicable to the in process technologies 
first  the overall discount rate in each transaction was determined by comparing the expected future cash flows from each business with the purchase price paid 
the implied discount rate is the rate necessary to discount the projected free cash flows back to a present value equal to the purchase price 
a market derived rate was also estimated for each company 
the market derived rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for five paces and secureware 
the weighted average cost of capital is the implied rate of return an investor would require for an investment in a company with similar risk and business characteristics to each of the two acquisitions 
it is determined by examining market information for several comparable companies  using this information to estimate an equity cost of capital using the capital asset pricing model  determining the applicable cost of debt and calculating a weighted average of the two rates 
as a third approach  rates of return demanded by venture capital investors for investments in start up companies with similar risks to those of the in process products  were researched and reviewed 
the higher rate of return for five paces is consistent with the higher risks and higher anticipated returns associated with those in process technologies 
secureware s in process technologies represented new versions of existing products 
once completed  these standardized products could provide security to a wide range of network and internet applications 
secureware s historical commercial relationships included such lower risk customers such as the us government and hewlett packard 
in contrast  the five paces in process technologies were applications for an entirely new industry internet banking 
security first network bank was the first internet bank and the long term success and viability of this industry is not yet proven or certain 
there is a significantly greater risk associated with an investment in this type of application 
for both five paces and secureware  the discount rate applied to the in process technologies was greater than the anticipated overall return expected on each company as a whole 
the overall rate of return does not reflect the risk specific to a particular project or product 
the in process research and development is similar to a venture capital investment because there are no current revenues and the technical and commercial viability of the products under development is unproven and risky 
the rates applied to the in process research and development of secureware and five paces are similar to the rates demanded by venture capital investors for investments in start up companies with similar risks to those of the in process products 
the following is a status update on the three in house projects and technologies acquired from five paces and a comparison of actual results to the assumptions underlying the valuations banking 
at the time the appraisal was completed  banking version  which is built on a two tier architecture  was anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of and installed in the s data center in the early part of further  management anticipated that a three tier version of banking would be completed and implemented in and thereby limit the revenues associated with the banking product 
the banking product was completed in the latter part of and installed at both customer locations and the s data center in early however  based on additional customer requirements for the banking version  management deferred the banking three tier development effort and continue developing additional functionality for the banking version 
during  s released additional versions of the banking x product to its existing customer base 
additionally  s determined that an intermediate release of the banking product  banking  which had extensive additional new functionality  would be required prior to the development and release of a three tier banking product 
installations of banking began in the fourth quarter the licensing and data center revenues actually realized from the banking product release have been greater than the amounts anticipated within the appraisal due to the longer than expected life of the product 
the costs associated with the completion of the initial version of banking were consistent with the anticipated costs reflected in the valuation 
credit card 
the credit card product was completed and delivered into production in august  both on schedule and within the costs anticipated in the valuation 
the revenues for the credit card product have been lower than originally anticipated in the appraisal due to lower than expected near term demand for the product in the marketplace 
however  in the latter part of and  a number of licenses have been sold for the credit card product and management anticipates that the revenues projected in the valuation will be realized from the new license sales 
investments 
as noted in the appraisal  the project development effort on this product began in january with an estimated completion date of february in february  a two tier architecture beta version of the investments product was tested on schedule and at a cost consistent with the projected costs contained within the appraisal 
based upon the completed testing and discussions with major customers regarding the scalability of the product  it was determined that the investments product would have to be redesigned on a three tier architecture to meet the requirements of the market 
further  s determined that the majority of its resources would have to be allocated to the continued upgrading of the banking product 
this decision resulted in limiting the further development of investments until such time as potential customers for the investments product agreed to fund the development effort for a three tier investments product 
in the latter part of the third quarter of  s sold  on a pre paid basis  four licenses for a three tier investments product totaling million  with a commitment to deliver a fully functional product sometime in the future 
the investments development effort was restarted in the fourth quarter of and testing of a three tier beta version of the software began in the second quarter of management anticipates that investments version will be completed and tested and become generally available for installation in due to the million in license sales made in the third quarter  the cash flows for direct licenses are greater than the amounts projected in the appraisal 
however  since it was determined that the investments product required a further development effort to upgrade the product to a three tier architecture prior to general release to customers  the data center processing revenues anticipated in the appraisal have not been realized at this time 
management anticipates that the projected data center revenues will be realized in after the introduction of the investments product which occurred in consolidated quarterly operating results the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december  and in the opinion of management  this unaudited information has been prepared on substantially the same basis as the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report and includes all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited consolidated quarterly data 
the unaudited consolidated quarterly data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report

during the fourth quarter of  our software license direct costs increased as a result of sales of our relationship management product which has third party royalty payments 
in an effort to reduce data center costs  s  which had previously outsourced the operations of the data center  ended its data center facilities management agreement 
as a result  data center direct costs decreased during the fourth quarter of  but depreciation and amortization expenses rose 
as a result of the termination of the data center facilities management agreement  s purchased approximately million of computer equipment 
immediately thereafter  s entered into a sale leaseback arrangement for this computer equipment with a third party which is accounted for as a capital lease 
s recorded a charge which has been included in depreciation and amortization of approximately million to adjust the carrying value of the leased computer equipment to its fair market value 
depreciation and amortization expenses were additionally impacted by a  write off of computer equipment to reflect results of a physical inventory and increased technology purchases as a result of s s growth 
also  during the fourth quarter of  our selling and marketing costs increased due to increased participation in trade shows and growth in sales and marketing personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses rose due mostly to a  charge for professional fees related to negotiation of a transaction as to which we did not ultimately enter into an agreement 
due to the limited operating history of our company  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on our historical operating results 
as a result  we establish expense levels based in part on future projections of revenues 
revenues currently depend heavily on our ability to sell software licenses and implementation and outsourcing services for internet banking solutions 
future revenues will likely include more data center revenues  which will depend on our customers ability to attract and retain end users 
if actual revenues are less than projected revenues  we may be unable to reduce expenses proportionately  which could adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
results of discontinued operations on september   s completed the sale of its banking operations to a us based subsidiary of the royal bank of canada 
the royal bank subsidiary agreed to pay million in excess of the net assets sold 
also  there is a million holdback for indemnification which will be received by s months from the closing date if there are no indemnifiable claims 
the banking operations included substantially all of the loans and investment securities as well as its deposit relationships and were legally separated from the technology operations through the formation of a holding company and the contribution of million in capital in connection with the sale of the banking operations 
s recorded a gain of  on the sale of its banking operations 
the gain on sale includes a million charge related to the estimated fair value of options to purchase s s capital stock issued to royal bank in march in connection with the sale by security first network bank of the banking operations 
the options give royal bank the right to purchase  shares of common and preferred stock for an aggregate of million at prices ranging from to per share at specified periods through june the first option for  shares at per share was exercised upon vesting in december the losses from the banking operations are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations 
net interest income for the nine month period ended september  was million and the net loss  excluding the gain on disposal  was million 
the increase in the loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended september  is the result of one time charges related to the sale of the banking operations 
royal bank has continued as a customer of s through a data center arrangement 
in addition  royal bank has entered into technology licensing and consulting arrangements with s for million  which were effective upon closing of the sale of the banking operations 
liquidity and capital resources total stockholders equity decreased to million as of december  from million at december  the decrease in stockholders equity is primarily attributable to the million net loss incurred during this decrease was partially offset by the issuance of  shares of common stock to royal bank for million in march  the issuance of  shares of preferred stock to a subsidiary of state farm for million on september   the issuance of  shares of common stock to broadvision in connection with licensing broadvision s one to one product  the issuance of  shares of common stock to broadvision in exchange for  shares of broadvision common stock  and the issuance of  shares to royal bank s subsidiary for million upon exercise of an option 
as part of the royal bank agreements signed in march  s issued to royal bank s subsidiary four separate options to purchase up to an aggregate million in capital stock of s the first option  which was exercised in december for  shares  had a per share exercise price of 
the second option has a per share exercise price of and expires at the end of june the third option has a per share exercise price of and expires at the end of december the fourth option has a per share exercise price of and expires at the end of june if the second  third and fourth options are exercised in full  s will issue an additional  shares of stock over the remaining option period 
at december   s had million in cash to fund future operations and million in accounts receivable 
in january  s received million in cash for a license agreement  which was included in accounts receivable at december  for the year ended december   s used million in continuing operations compared to million in comparable period in management believes that s has adequate cash resources available to fund operations through the next twelve months 
year readiness disclosure statement the year issue relates to the use by many existing computer programs of only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year s recognizes the need to ensure that potential year software failures will not adversely impact its operations 
the year issues impact s both on an external basis in connection with the products and services s offers to clients  as well as on an internal basis as to its own operations and systems 
as to external year issues related to the products and services s offers to clients  a company wide task force  with representation from all major business units  was established by s in to evaluate and manage the risks  solutions and cost associated with addressing this issue 
the task force has identified all business systems  products and services  including third party software used by s and in conjunction with virtual financial manager  has made an initial assessment as to whether they are year compliant  and is implementing actions for the systems  products and services which are not year compliant 
s believes that based on the assessments completed to date  that material year issues can be corrected 
the failure of s or third party software which is used by s or in conjunction with virtual financial manager to be year compliant could have a material adverse impact on s s financial position and results of operations 
s developed its newest version of the virtual financial manager software  version  which was released in  to be year compliant 
extensive time machine testing has been conducted on virtual financial manager and all of the underlying software products that it utilizes 
as we implement this new version of virtual financial manager for each of our clients  we also will conduct complete end to end testing 
of systems requiring upgrades to version  one was completed by december  management anticipates that all clients will be converted to the new version  with testing completed  by third quarter any failure to complete the conversions in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on s s business 
these conversions will require a significant portion of s s implementation resources 
management anticipates a reduction in professional services margins for due to the deployment of resources and negotiated discounts of services related to these implementations 
because s is a relatively new enterprise  without old legacy and other computer systems  the year issues with respect to s s internal operations and systems are not as complex as might otherwise be the case 
s s task force has developed and implemented a strategy to minimize the impact of year technology problems 
s s strategic plan includes regular reporting of progress to s s management and board of directors 
under the direction of its task force  s believes it has identified all hardware  software  networks and other processing platforms  and customer and vendor dependencies affected by the year date change 
the assessment included information systems as well as environment systems that are dependent on embedded microchips  such as security systems  elevators  and telephone systems 
s has completed activities related to the assessment phase 
while the assessment phase is essentially complete  s will continue to revisit all third party suppliers throughout to insure that previously acquired compliance statements have not changed 
the next phase of the task force s plan is a renovation phase which has been underway since early in the majority of s s internal and vendor systems were year ready by december   with the remainder targeted for completion by the second quarter of all desktop systems have been tested with failing systems scheduled for replacement 
upgrades for critical financial and other infrastructure systems have been completed 
as to s s systems which are vendor supplied  s has either had the vendor confirm year readiness  or has made plans to replace the system 
the task force has commenced a testing phase of s s internal systems  including testing of incremental changes to hardware and software components 
the testing phase is expected to be completed by june   but will continue as needed on newly acquired applications and new vendor upgrades 
the costs incurred in addressing the year problem are being expensed as incurred in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles 
none of these costs are expected to materially impact the results of operations in any one period 
significant portions of the costs to be incurred are not expected to be incremental but rather are related to current development efforts 
s has identified and evaluated potential year related worst case scenarios that could result from the failure to identify  test  and validate all critical date dependent applications and embedded microchips that affect core business processes and the failure of external forces  such as third party vendors and utilities  to have properly remedied their systems 
potential worst case scenarios being addressed include the inability to service customers through s s data center  the failure of virtual financial manager  extended electrical power outages  extended telephone communication outages  ach and payroll deposit file transmission difficulties and excessive negative media coverage 
a contingency plan is being drafted by s to address identified potential worst case scenarios 
alternative solutions for business resumption and approaches to minimize the impact of each scenario are being formulated 
any unaddressed year issue could adversely affect s s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
the foreign currency financial statements of s s australian operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates  except revenues  costs and expenses  which are translated at average exchange rates during each reporting period 
net exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income 
therefore  s s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk occurs when translating the financial results of s s australian operations to us dollars in consolidation 
at this time  s does not use instruments to hedge its foreign exposure in australia because the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations is not material 
net assets of s s foreign operations at december  were approximately  us s is exposed to market risk from changes in its investment securities available for sale which consists entirely of s s investments in broadvision  inc common stock 
at december   marketable securities of s were recorded at fair value of approximately million 
the investment in broadvision  inc common stock held by s has exposure to price risk  which is estimated as the potential loss in fair value due to a hypothetical change of in quoted market prices 
this hypothetical change would reduce s s investments as well as s s unrealized gains on investment securities available for sale which are included as a component of stockholders equity 
this hypothetical change would have an immaterial effect on the recorded value of s s investment securities available for sale 
s s only long term liabilities are capital lease obligations at a fixed rate 
therefore  s does not believe there is any material exposure to market risk changes in interest rates relating to the current or long term liabilities
