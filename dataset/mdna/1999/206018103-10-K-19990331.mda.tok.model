year compliance many older computer systems and software products currently in use are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result computer systems and or software used by many companies will need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
all of the services currently offered by the company are designed to be year compliant 
however  the company s services are often integrated or used in conjunction with third party software  such software may not be compatible with company s services or year compliant 
the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in other s products  custom scripts created by third parties to interface with the company s services or issues arising from the integration of multiple products and systems within an overall system 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
over the past three years  the company has made year compliance a priority in it purchasing and installation decisions 
the company s internal information technology group has adopted a year compliance program to assess and address any year issues which remain related to the company s it and non it systems 
the program consists of the following phases identifying year application issues  updating applications  identifying year systems and operating systems issues such phases are complete  collecting manufacturer s compliance statements  verifying solutions to year issues  updating and or patching operating systems  updating firmware and phasing out unsupported hardware such phases are in process and scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 
as of january   the company has spent approximately  of the currently estimated  total cost of the program 
costs incurred and expected to be incurred consist primarily of the cost of company personnel involved in updating applications and operating systems and the costs of software updates and patches many of which are provided free of charge from the vendors 
funds for the year compliance program are expected to be provided from available working capital 
the company has utilized the company s internal technical personnel  and intends to continue to use such personnel  to address year issues  rather than contract with third party consultants 
although the company has not completed its survey of third parties with which it has a material relationship  the majority of the company s customers are sophisticated it vendors and users who are addressing their own year issues and the company relies primarily on its own technical personnel and internal it systems  rather than third party suppliers 
as the company s year compliance program is on schedule to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company has not formulated a most reasonably likely worst case scenario or formulated a contingency plan should the program fail to be completed by such date 
the company has verified of its third party supply chain 
any third party supplier that does not respond by the end of the first quarter of will be replaced  if necessary 
significant uncertainty still exists as to the global implications of the year issue 
the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues in a variety of ways 
many companies including customers of the company  and customers or potential customers of the company s customers are expending significant resources to correct or patch their current hardware and software systems for year compliance 
such expenditures may result in reduced funds available for the company s customers to pursue product development programs or it systems enhancements for which the company s services would otherwise be utilized 
any of the foregoing  including costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  reductions in development programs or it systems enhancements by customers and their customers or the failure of the company to adequately resolve internal year compliance issues could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
certain factors that may affect future results  financial condition and market price of securities numerous factors may affect the company s business and its results of operations 
these factors include the client and industry concentrations  management s ability to accurately estimate resources required for fixed price contracts  the company s ability to meet client expectations and deliverable dates  the company s ability to manage the substantial growth of the company  potential for significant fluctuations in quarterly results  management s ability to attract and retain professional staff  the company s ability to develop it solutions with rapid technological advances  and general economic and business conditions
