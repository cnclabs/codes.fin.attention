item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sales our total sales in the fourth quarter increased from billion to billion  compared to the fourth quarter the fourth quarter of had an extra week compared to the same quarter of because fiscal contained weeks compared to a week year in for the full year  total sales increased and food store sales increased 
in the fourth quarter  food store sales increased 
sales by operating segments for the three years ended january   were as follows of sales amount change amount change amount change millions of dollars food stores    convenience stores   other sales total sales    after adjusting for the rd week in  fourth quarter total sales increased  from billion to billion  and food store sales rose  from billion to billion 
these are in comparison to fourth quarter after adjusting for the extra week in  the percentage of change in sales by operating segments for the three years ended january   were of sales change change change food stores convenience stores other sales total sales sales in identical food stores  which include stores in operation and not expanded or relocated for five quarters  increased in the fourth quarter and increased for the full year 
comparable store sales  which include identical stores plus expanded and relocated stores  increased in the fourth quarter 
the increase in food store sales is related to the square footage growth generated by kroger s capital expenditure program 
this program enabled us to open  relocate or expand food stores during most of the new and expanded stores feature our combination store format 
this one stop shopping format saves time and travel for customers and is adaptable to the demographics of individual markets 
total sales in our convenience stores decreased for the year and increased during the fourth quarter of adjusting for the extra week  convenience stores total sales decreased for the year and in the fourth quarter of the sales decrease during the fourth quarter can be attributed to a decrease in the retail price of gasoline 
total gasoline sales dollars decreased for the year 
total gasoline gallons sold increased for the year 
the percentage of change in convenience store identical gasoline sales dollars  gasoline gallons sold and non gasoline sales dollars for the th quarter and year ended january  were th quarter identical convenience stores change change gasoline sales dollars gasoline gallons sold non gasoline sales dollars other sales represent sales by our manufacturing plants to entities other than kroger 
compared to  other sales increased for the fourth quarter and for the year 
adjusting for the extra week in  other sales increased for the fourth quarter and for the year 
total food store square footage increased  and in   and  respectively 
convenience store square footage decreased in due to operational closings of stores and disposition of stores 
convenience store square footage decreased in  and increased in sales per average square foot for the last three years were total sales per average square foot food stores convenience stores sales per average square foot for include an extra week compared to and excluding the extra week  sales per average square foot for would have been for food stores and for convenience stores 
sales per average square foot exclude stores operated by franchisees 
our storing program in and has led to the decrease in sales per average square foot in our food stores 
the new stores  which are generally larger and built in developing areas  take longer to contribute to higher sales per square foot 
they also reduce the sales per square foot at nearby stores 
one time expenses in the second quarter of  we incurred a million pre tax  million after tax or 
per diluted share  one time expense associated with logistics projects 
this expense included the costs associated with ending a joint venture related to a warehouse operation that formerly served our michigan stores and several independent customers 
the warehouse is now operated by a third party that distributes our inventory to our michigan stores 
these expenses also included the transition costs related to one of our new warehouses  and one new warehouse facility operated by an unaffiliated entity that provides services to us 
these costs included carrying costs of the facilities idled as a result of these new warehouses and the associated employee severance costs 
the expenses described above include non cash asset writedowns of million and were included in merchandise costs  including warehouse and transportation 
the remaining million of expenses are summarized as follows cash amount accrued expense payments at january  thousands of dollars employee severance    carrying costs of idled facilities    ending the joint venture   the employee severance costs will be paid through the second quarter of and the carrying costs of the idled warehouse facilities are projected to be paid through additionally  in the second quarter of  we incurred one time expenses of million pre tax  million after tax or 
per diluted share  associated with accounting  data and operations consolidations in texas 
these included the costs of closing eight stores and relocating the remaining dallas office employees to a smaller facility 
these expenses  which include non cash asset writedowns of million  were included in operating  general and administrative expenses 
cash expenses paid to date are million and the remaining accrual of million at january  represents estimated rent or lease termination costs that will be paid on closed stores through accounting change in the second quarter of  we changed our application of the last in  first out  or lifo method of accounting for store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method 
the change was made to more accurately reflect inventory value by eliminating the averaging and estimation inherent in the retail method 
the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to december  cannot be determined 
the effect of the change on the december  inventory valuation  which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods  was included in restated results for the quarter ended march  this change increased merchandise costs by million and reduced earnings before extraordinary loss and net earnings by million  or per diluted share 
we have not calculated the pro forma effect on prior periods because cost information for these periods is not determinable 
the item cost method did not have a material impact on earnings subsequent to its initial adoption 
merchandise costs merchandise costs include advertising  warehousing and transportation expenses and charges related to valuing inventory on the lifo method 
the following table shows the relative effect of lifo charges  one time expenses and the accounting change on merchandising costs as a percent of sales 
merchandise costs as reported one time expenses 
accounting change 
merchandise costs net of one time expenses and accounting change lifo charge 


merchandise costs as adjusted our merchandise costs  adjusted for one time expenses and the accounting change  as a percent of sales declined during from the and levels 
merchandise costs were reduced by coordinated purchasing  category management  technology related efficiencies  and increases in private label sales 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were  and  in  and respectively 
operating  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales  excluding one time expenses of million  were for the increase is due to higher incentive payouts based on our performance 
income taxes we have closed all tax years through with the internal revenue service 
the internal revenue service has completed its examination of our tax returns for tax years on september   the irs voluntarily dismissed its appeal against kroger 
this action settled a previously unresolved issue for tax years one issue remains in dispute with the irs for tax years and we have provided for this and other tax contingencies 
net earnings net earnings and the effects of extraordinary losses  one time expenses and the accounting change for the three years ended january  were thousands of dollars earnings before extraordinary loss excluding one time expenses and the accounting change    one time expense  net of income tax benefit  accounting change  net of income tax benefit  earnings before extraordinary loss    extraordinary loss  net of income tax benefit    net earnings    extraordinary losses are from the early retirement of debt 
net earnings in compared to and were affected by net interest expense in of million compared to million in and million in  and depreciation expense in of million  compared to million in and million in liquidity and capital resources debt management and interest expense the table below provides information about debt repurchases and redemptions for the three years ended january  thousands of dollars senior debt repurchases and redemptions    senior subordinated debt repurchases    mortgage loan prepayments   we used the proceeds from the issuance of new senior debt  additional bank borrowings and cash generated from operations to make these purchases and redemptions 
we have a day credit agreement and five year credit agreement together  the credit agreement with a consortium of bank lenders 
the day credit agreement is a revolving credit facility in the amount of million  that terminates on may   unless extended 
the five year credit agreement is a revolving credit facility in the amount of billion  that terminates on may   unless extended or terminated earlier by us 
the average interest rate on our bank debt was in compared to in and in our borrowings at year end under the credit agreement totaled million compared to billion at year end and billion at year end in december we amended our credit agreement to permit our merger with fred meyer 
the amendments  which become effective when the merger is completed  increase our rates to market rates 
our rates under the credit agreement are variable 
as of january   we had billion available under our credit agreement to meet short term liquidity needs 
long term debt  including capital leases and current portion thereof  decreased million to billion at year end from billion at year end and billion at year end we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some structured financings in an effort to further reduce our effective interest expense 
we also prefunded million of employee benefit costs at year end compared to million at year end if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases  which we classify as investments  and the prefunding of employee benefits  our year end long term debt would have been million less  or billion  compared to billion at year end and billion at year end interest rate protection program we use derivatives to limit our exposure to rising interest rates 
during we followed these guidelines in using derivatives use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  include no leveraged derivative products  and hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
we review compliance with these guidelines annually with the financial policy committee of our board of directors 
in addition  our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis 
these guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the table below provides information about our interest rate derivative and underlying debt portfolio 
the amounts each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives 
interest rates reflect the weighted average for the maturing instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and variable rate debt is based on month libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes only those debt instruments for which it is reasonably possible to calculate a fair value and interest rate derivatives as of january  see fair value of financial instruments footnote 
expected year of maturity thousands of dollars thereafter total fair value long term debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate interest rate derivatives average notional amounts outstanding thousands of dollars variable to fixed         average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable       average pay rate average receive rate it was not practicable to determine a fair value for million of fixed rate debt 
common stock repurchase program on january   we began repurchasing common stock in order to reduce dilution caused by our stock option plans 
these repurchases were made using the proceeds  including the tax benefit  from options exercised 
further repurchases of up to million of common stock were authorized by the board of directors during october on october   we suspended the repurchase program as result of the merger agreement between kroger and fred meyer  inc during  we made open market purchases of  shares of kroger stock for million compared to purchases in of  shares for million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for totaled million  compared to million in  and million in the capital expenditures include the acquisition of seven owens stores in the third quarter and five hilander stores in the fourth quarter 
the owens stores are located in indiana and the hilander stores are located in illinois 
during we opened  acquired or expanded food stores and convenience stores 
the table below shows our storing activity 
food stores new stores relocated stores acquisitions new acquisitions relocations expansions total opened  acquired or expanded operational closings convenience stores new stores relocated stores acquisitions new expansions total opened  acquired or expanded operational closings in addition to the above activity  we also completed food store and convenience store remodels during consolidated statement of cash flows during  we generated  million in cash from operating activities compared to million in and million in the increase over is primarily due to a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities that provided million of cash in compared to million in the largest components of the change in operating assets and liabilities was a decrease in net owned inventories of million compared to a decrease of million in and an increase in other liabilities of million compared to million in the increase over also includes an increase of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
investing activities used million of cash in compared to million in and million in the increase in the use of cash resulted from increased capital expenditures of million  offset by decreased purchases of investments of million 
cash used by financing activities in totaled million compared to million in and million of cash provided in compared to  our financing activities in used an additional million of cash for debt prepayments and finance charges  and an additional million to repurchase capital stock 
ebitda our credit agreement and the indentures underlying approximately million of publicly issued debt  contain various restrictive covenants 
many of these covenants are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and lifo charge  or ebitda 
the ability to generate ebitda at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these agreements is a key measure of our financial strength 
we do not intend to present ebitda as an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
rather  management believes the presentation of ebitda is important for understanding kroger s performance compared to our debt covenants 
the calculation of ebitda is based on the definition contained in our credit agreement 
this may be a different definition than other companies use 
we were in compliance with all credit agreement and indenture covenants on january  ebitda for  excluding one time expenses  as described in one time expenses above  of million and the million accounting change  as described in accounting change above  increased to billion compared to billion in ebitda in was billion 
excluding the effect of strikes in the king soopers and city market divisions  ebitda would have been approximately billion in ebitda including one time expenses and the accounting change increased in to billion compared to billion in other issues on october  we announced our intended merger with fred meyer  inc under the terms of the merger agreement  fred meyer  inc shareholders will receive one newly issued share of kroger common stock for each fred meyer  inc common share 
the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we expect to close the transaction in spring subject to approval of kroger and fred meyer shareholders  antitrust clearance and customary closing conditions 
additional information regarding the merger can be found in our current report on form k dated october  on january   we changed our fiscal year end to the saturday nearest january of each year 
this change is disclosed in our current report on form k dated january  our first new fiscal year will end january  it will include a week first quarter ending may   and week second  third and fourth quarters ending august   november   and january   respectively 
we intend to file separate audited statements of operations and cash flows covering the transition period from january  to january  on a current report on form k on or before may  we are party to more than collective bargaining agreements with local unions representing approximately  employees 
during we negotiated labor contracts without any material work stoppages 
typical agreements are to years in duration and  as agreements expire  we expect to enter into new collective bargaining agreements 
in  collective bargaining agreements will expire 
we cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
outlook statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of since the intended merger described in the other issues section above is not expected to close until spring  the effects of the merger are not considered in making these statements unless referred to specifically 
while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
in particular we obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
we expect full year square footage to grow to 
we expect to continue to realize savings from economies of scale in technology and logistics  some of which may be reinvested in retail price reductions to increase sales volume and enhance market share 
we expect combination stores to generate higher sales per customer by the inclusion of numerous specialty departments  such as pharmacies  seafood shops  floral shops and bakeries 
we believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers and restaurants 
we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we expect to continue capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations  logistics  procurement  category management  merchandising and distribution practices  which should continue to reduce merchandising costs as a percent of sales 
we expect to reduce working capital over the next years 
in the second quarter of we raised our earnings per share target to a average annual increase over fiscal years from the previously stated target of a average annual increase 
assuming consummation of the merger referenced in the other issues section above  we are raising our earnings per share target to a average annual increase over the next three years effective with the year we expect capital expenditures for the year to total million compared to million during all of capital expenditures reflect kroger s strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis  whenever possible  on self development and ownership of store real estate  and on logistics and technology improvements 
we are dependent on computer hardware  software  systems and processes it systems and non information technology systems such as telephones  clocks  scales and refrigeration controllers  and other equipment containing embedded microprocessor technology non it systems 
these systems are used in several critical operating areas including store and distribution operations  product merchandising and procurement  manufacturing plant operations  inventory and labor management  and accounting and administrative systems 
year readiness disclosure we are currently working to resolve the potential effect of the year on the processing of date sensitive information within these various systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
we have developed a plan to assess and update our it systems and non it systems for year compliance requirements and provide for continued functionality 
the plan consists of three major phases create an inventory of systems subject to the year problem and assess the scope of the problem as it relates to those systems remediate any year problems test and implement systems subsequent to remediation the chart below shows the estimated completion status of each of these phases expressed as a percent of completion as of the end of phase percent complete it systems non it systems this summary includes all it and non it systems without regard to their effect on the operation of the company 
we estimate that business critical it systems are complete through phase we expect to complete assessment and remediation of these by the end of the first quarter of we will continue to test our systems  including a simulation of the year  and expect to complete all work by the end of the third quarter of in addition to the remediation of the it systems and non it systems  we are contacting all critical product suppliers  service providers  and those with which we exchange information  to ensure they will be able to continue normal business operations uninterrupted 
this effort also consists of three phases identify the entities and verify address and contact information mail the initial request receive and accept response this third step includes the verification of year readiness  if appropriate 
during the fourth quarter of  we have identified additional external entities to contact for year compliance 
to date  we have identified and mailed year verification requests to approximately of the critical external entities 
approximately of these entities have responded  and less than of their year readiness plans have been verified 
we expect that substantially all critical external entities will have been contacted and year readiness verified by the end of the first quarter we have not developed contingency plans related to all uncertainties in our year plan 
based on the results of our testing  implementation and verification efforts noted above  we will establish contingency plans in mission critical processes to address potential additional year issues 
contingency plans are being developed and accessed by teams of programmers and users 
we expect that these contingency plans will be in place by the end of the third quarter of the total estimated cost for the project  over a four year period  is million  most of which is being expensed as incurred 
this cost is being funded through operating cash flow 
this represents an immaterial part of our information technology budget over the period 
the breakdown of the costs are as follows 
total projected cost incurred cost to date in millions in millions labor internal labor external hardware upgrades software upgrades non it upgrades other total if we  our customers or vendors are unable to resolve processing issues in a timely manner  it could result in the disruption of the operation of it systems and or non it systems  and in a material financial risk 
we believe that we have allocated the resources necessary to mitigate all significant year issues in a timely manner 
inflationary factors  increased competition  construction delays  and labor disputes could affect our ability to obtain expected increases in sales and earnings 
delays in store maturity  increased competition and increased capital spending could adversely affect the anticipated increase in sales per square foot 
increases in gross profit rate may not be achieved if start up costs are higher than expected or if problems associated with integrating new systems occur 
increased operating costs and changes in inflationary trends could prevent us from reducing operating  general and administrative expenses 
new technologies could fail to achieve the desired savings and efficiencies 
net interest expenses could exceed expectations due to acquisitions  higher working capital usage  inflation  or increased competition 
our ability to achieve our storing goals could be hampered by construction delays  labor disputes  increased competition or delays in technology projects 
the effects of the intended merger and the inherent complexity of computer software and reliance on third party software vendors to interface with our systems could affect the completion of necessary year modifications
