record steel fabrication and copper tube profitability sustained the manufacturing segment in spite of significant losses incurred on several large structural fabrication contracts 
steel mill shipments  prices  and operating profits declined due to construction interference  imports  and equipment outages 
significant lifo income due to substantial decrease in prices 
new rolling mill in south carolina and finishing end at the alabama mill were completed 
litigation settlements received  million  after tax 
continuing poor market conditions resulted in recycling segment loss  however  the fourth quarter was profitable 
the marketing and trading segment continued profitable performance 
segments financial results for the company s reportable segments have been prepared using a management approach  which is consistent with the basis and manner in which management internally disaggregates financial information for the purposes of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
using this approach  the company has three reportable segments manufacturing  recycling  and marketing and trading 
net sales and operating profit loss by business segment are shown in the following table year ended august  in millions net sales manufacturing    recycling marketing and trading operating profit loss manufacturing recycling marketing and trading compared to 
manufacturing 
the manufacturing segment includes the cmc steel group and howell metal company 
although net sales decreased  operating profit increased for the year ended august  these were record earnings despite weaker steel mill prices stemming from low priced steel imports 
shipments by the four minimills totaled million tons versus million tons the prior year 
was another record year in the downstream steel fabrication businesses with  tons shipped  a slight increase from fiscal year copper tube results were outstanding as the strong housing market and lower copper scrap prices doubled operating profit 
copper tube annual shipments were comparable at million pounds 
lower prices in the manufacturing segment resulted in pre tax lifo income of million  a substantial increase from the million reported in the prior year 
august  average mill selling price average fab selling price average scrap purchase price operating profit for the four steel minimills combined was below the record year of although underlying demand was strong  shipments declined to million tons while production levels were down comparably because of construction interference caused by the capital projects and the unprecedented import levels 
conversely  margins were aided by lower scrap purchase prices 
while the average mill selling price was per ton below last year  average scrap purchase costs were lower by per ton 
the company received pre tax million in settlements from graphite electrode antitrust litigation 
primarily as a result of the decline in shipments  operating profit at smi arkansas  smi alabama  and smi south carolina decreased by  and  respectively 
in spite of transformer downtime  strong results continued at smi texas  with a increase in operating profit from the prior year 
computer migration costs were million compared to million in the prior year 
the company had a record million in capital spending for fiscal  primarily at the steel minimills 
the major capital projects for were the completion of the new rolling mill and ancillary equipment at smi south carolina and a new finishing line replacement of the mill cooling bed  straighteners and stackers at smi alabama 
commissioning was in april and june  respectively 
the south carolina project ultimately will more than double capacity to  tons  reduce costs and broaden significantly the product range 
the alabama improvements will improve quality  enhance efficiency  and extend the product line 
fiscal year was another record year in the cmc steel group s downstream fabrication businesses 
net sales increased by from  and operating profits increased 
this strong performance was in spite of million in operating losses sustained on some large and complex structural steel jobs 
while fabricated steel shipments totaled  tons  only marginally increased from the prior year  the average fab selling price rose per ton  partially due to product mix 
additionally  a new castellated beam and cellular beam product line was developed as an adjunct to the steel joist business 
during the third quarter  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of construction materials  inc  headquartered in baton rouge  louisiana  which complements the shepler s group concrete related products business 
the purchase price was not significant to the company 
the operation has been profitable since acquisition 
production increased by  and earnings more than doubled for the company s copper tube mill for spreads increased by and shipments increased by  benefiting from lower copper scrap prices 
the principal economic driver remains housing starts and renovation  as residential construction remained strong during fiscal year a significant planned expansion of the plant will increase copper tube output by approximately  increase automation  reduce finished goods purchases  improve productivity and increase sales for hvac applications as well as water tube 

recycling 
the recycling segment continued to be hampered by difficult market conditions 
the secondary metals processing division reported an operating loss of million for the fiscal year ended august   compared with an operating loss of million for the prior year 
however  the division was profitable for the fourth quarter  and cash flows from operations before changes in current assets and liabilities was positive for the year 
together with very weak market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous scrap  the failed consolidation of the industry had a major negative influence on profitability in the poor markets were reflected in a drop in net sales  from million for to million for processing costs also decreased  but margins fell even further 
the average price of steel scrap fell by per ton to  and ferrous scrap volume was lower 
consequently  ferrous scrap operations were unprofitable even though costs were reduced 
nonferrous prices  on the other hand  stabilized in a trading range  shipments increased by and nonferrous operations were slightly profitable 
the division s regional management restructuring which occurred in the prior year resulted in lower operating costs and inventories 
prices have recently increased especially nonferrous scrap after sharp declines over the past months 
in fiscal year  a number of operational improvements continued to be made including installation of a new shear in houston which started up during late august the total volume of scrap processed in  including the cmc steel group operations  increased to million tons 

marketing and trading 
the marketing and trading segment continued its remarkable performance in the face of crises in asia  russia and latin america 
net sales increased by to million  and operating profit was higher for than the prior year 
steel prices were substantially lower in than the prior year  and gross margins in steel marketing and distribution as well as steel trading remained tight 
anti dumping activity and other forms of protectionism around the world continued to affect the flow of products 
nevertheless  sales into the united states and europe increased and compensated for the decreased sales into asia 
the segment achieved further market penetration in highly competitive markets for nonferrous metal products and maintained profitability through product line expansion 
profits were moderately lower for industrial raw materials and products  but shipments generally were higher 
participation in the marketing of ferrous raw materials continued to grow 
during  the segment continued to diversify and build business in new product and geographic areas  and added key personnel 
the marketing and trading segment s international division reaped the rewards from a joint venture with a large european mill giving the company exclusive rights to sell steel to the german market 
resulting net sales from this endeavor were significantly more than anticipated 
this segment s business encompasses marketing and distribution including expanded just in time services 
regional trade continued to grow  as well as increased presence in the processing of the materials and products which are bought and sold 
near term outlook despite the continued high level of low priced steel imports into the united states  which will continue to affect prices of mill products  demand for steel remains strong and manufacturing margins should be good 
the new mill in south carolina will ultimately double capacity  reduce costs and broaden the product range 
our new finishing end in alabama will improve quality  enhance efficiency and also broaden the product line 
higher sales  production and shipments are anticipated for the cmc steel group for fiscal year however  mill profits are likely to be down because of a weaker first half due to continued ramping up at south carolina and alabama  weaker pricing from a less favorable product mix and continued high imports 
mill output should increase as new production lines are added  and the average selling price should benefit from the broadened product lines 
increased profits in steel fabrication should result in the second half of the upcoming year from turn arounds at several operations that performed poorly in fiscal year increased infrastructure spending under the transportation equity act for the st century tea should be very beneficial 
the copper tube market remains robust  and production and shipments should climb 
the cmc steel group computer migration project is substantially complete  and costs will decline to maintenance levels 
both ferrous and nonferrous operations in the recycling segment should be profitable in fiscal year operating profit for the fourth quarter of was substantially improved from the corresponding period in scrap prices appear to be relatively firm at prevailing levels  and demand is expected to increase with both international and domestic consumers of scrap 
the company is poised to capitalize on better markets and to continue to turn around underperforming facilities 
recycling should benefit from plant and equipment improvements made during the past several years including shredders  shears and balers 
the pickup in global trade  resulting from improving asian and european economies  should be positive for the marketing and trading segment  in spite of the decreased supply from a large financially troubled international supplier 
the company will continue to diversify and build business in new products and geographic areas 
the segment will build further on strategic alliances among suppliers and customers 
overall  the outlook is challenging but positive  with the second half of fiscal year expected to be better than the first half 
long term outlook the company is well positioned to exploit long term opportunities 
net sales and net income should increase substantially at the steel minimills 
the mills are versatile  flexible  highly productive and high quality 
finished product capacity at the combined mills has increased to million tons 
steel fabrication will continue to be an essential element of the company s vertical integration strategy and a growing part of the business 
the company s strong regional position in the copper tube industry is a solid building block for further market penetration 
long term demand for scrap will continue to grow  and volume will increase at existing operations 
capital expenditures over the past five years have enhanced significantly the capability to process high quality scrap in an efficient manner 
the organizational setup for the marketing and trading segment was revised as of the beginning of fiscal year  including the addition of the position of president 
among other benefits  the new structure should lead to more unity and synergies and better risk management while maintaining entrepreneurial spirit 
the segment will continue its evolution toward more marketing and distribution  while maintaining a strong presence in the trading side of the business 
the company will also further its efforts on value added businesses whereby it will broaden its product range and provide more services to the customer and the supplier 
the sections regarding segments and near and long term outlook contain forward looking statements regarding the outlook for the company s financial results including product pricing and demand  capacity increases  efficiency improvements and general market conditions 
there is inherent risk and uncertainty in any forward looking statements 
variances will occur and some could be materially different from management s current opinion 
developments that could impact the company s expectations include interest rate changes  construction activity  unanticipated start up expenses and delays  metals pricing  over which the company exerts little influence  increased capacity and product availability from competing steel minimills and other steel suppliers including import quantities and pricing  global factors including credit availability  currency fluctuations and decisions by governments impacting the level and pace of overall economic activity 
compared to segments 
manufacturing 
net sales for the manufacturing segment increased and operating profit increased 
the cmc steel group accounted for these increases 
the copper tube division s annual operating profit was down slightly 
selling prices were lower at the beginning of but recovered  and combined with record shipments produced a increase in annual operating profit for the cmc steel group 
mill tonnage shipped at  was ahead of last year 
the four mills showed a increase in operating profit led by smi alabama and smi arkansas  each with increases in excess of  particularly notable was the turnaround in profitability of smi south carolina which was profitable all fiscal year 
its results were all the more noteworthy as they were attained in the midst of construction of a new rolling mill 
smi texas operating profit was ahead of the prior year 
operating profit in the company s steel fabrication businesses more than doubled 
fabricated shipments of  tons were well ahead of the previous year of  tons 
smi owen steel  the large structural fabrication facility in columbia  south carolina  had operating profit million ahead of the prior year 
a similar gain was accomplished by the combined joist plants 
as of august   the company ceased operations at its railcar rebuilding facility in tulsa  oklahoma 
cmc steel group computer migration project expenses totaled million compared with million in final pension settlement cost of million was incurred as the company s only major defined benefit plan was terminated 
the company spent million for capital improvements for fiscal  primarily at the steel mills 
construction of the new rolling mill and ancillary equipment at smi south carolina will ultimately double capacity  reduce costs  and broaden the product line 
the finishing upgrade at smi alabama replacement of the mill cooling bed  straighteners and stackers will improve quality  enhance efficiency and also broaden the product line 
attractive interest rates continue to strengthen residential construction markets  maintaining demand for plumbing tube 
margins were weak in the early months of  but improved to moderate proportions by the fourth quarter 
copper tube shipments increased over the prior year to million pounds 
annual production was above s rate 

recycling 
the asian economic crisis brought the recycling segment s four year period of record operating profits to an abrupt end 
scrap normally exported by competitors was diverted for domestic consumption 
selling prices were decimated  falling to their lowest levels in many years 
margins eroded while total processing costs increased due to acquisitions  however  the new capacity failed to bring in sufficient margin increases 
all of these factors resulted in a moderate operating loss the first in six years in this cyclical industry 
for  the average copper and brass scrap price dropped  aluminum fell  and steel scrap was unchanged  at year end this left prices below the previous year 
ferrous scrap shipped increased to million tons  however  nonferrous shipments declined to  tons  due to a drop in copper and brass shipments 
total volume of scrap processed  including the cmc steel group processing plants  reached  tons 
during the company made several small acquisitions within existing geographic areas  none of which were significant to the overall operations of the company 

marketing and trading 
net sales for the marketing and trading segment increased  and operating income rose over the prior year 
purchases from new sources in the far east increased significantly while sales were sharply reduced 
shipments into north america were brisk for most product lines and business in europe increased 
operating profits from steel marketing and distribution increased  however  profitability in steel trading decreased because of reduced volume and margins 
nonferrous metal product tonnage increased particularly in semi finished aluminum products 
activity for ores  minerals and industrial materials continued solid  meanwhile  new marketing channels were added 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations before changes in current assets and liabilities for the year ended august   were a record million compared to million for fiscal year also  net cash flows from operating activities for fiscal were the highest in the company s history 
strong earnings and working capital reduction initiatives generated the cash flows from operating activities 
accounts receivable and inventories significantly decreased in the cmc steel group as a result of working capital reduction efforts and from the effect of falling prices 
decreased advances to suppliers for material purchases in the marketing and trading segment resulted in a net decrease in other assets 
this was partially offset on a consolidated basis by the cmc steel group s investments in mill rolls and guides for the new mill at south carolina 
also depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the capital projects at south carolina and alabama 
cash flows from operating activities were invested in new equipment  primarily in the manufacturing segment particularly at the south carolina and alabama mills 
accounts payable increased primarily in the marketing and trading segment due to more shipments in transit at year end and more extended payment terms from suppliers than in the prior year 
net working capital was million as of august   compared to million last year 
the current ratio was improved at versus at the prior year end 
the company s sources of short term funds include a commercial paper program of million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the company s commercial paper is rated in the second highest category by moody s investors service p  standard poor s corporation a and fitch ibca  inc f 
formal bank credit lines equal to of the amount of all commercial paper outstanding are maintained 
the company filed a shelf registration of million of long and medium term notes  of which million were sold in february the proceeds were used to retire short term borrowings 
the company s million long term notes issued in february million  july million and july million are rated investment grade by standard poor s corporation and fitch ibca  inc bbb and by moody s investors service baa 
the company has numerous informal credit facilities available from domestic and international banks 
these credit facilities are priced at bankers acceptance rates or on a cost of funds basis 
management believes it has adequate capital resources available from internally generated funds and from short term and long term capital markets to meet anticipated working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  dividend payments to shareholders  stock repurchases and to take advantage of new opportunities requiring capital 
capital investments in property  plant and equipment were a record million in compared to million the prior year 
capital spending for fiscal is projected to be substantially reduced at million 
the most important projects to be undertaken are the expansion of the howell metal company s copper tube manufacturing facility and growth in steel fabrication 
total capitalization was million at the end of fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
the ratio of long term debt to capitalization was  up from last year due to the issuance of the million long term notes 
stockholders equity was million or per share 
during the fiscal year  the company repurchased  shares of company stock at an average cost of per share 
the company has authorized an additional  shares for repurchase 
on august    treasury shares were held by the company 
there were  shares outstanding at year end 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting its business  the company becomes involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental matters 
the company s origin and one of its core businesses for over eight decades has been metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  the company has a continuing commitment to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are presently at odds with goals of greater recycling and expose the company and the industry to potentially significant risks 
such exposures are causing the industry to shrink  leaving fewer operators as survivors to face the challenge 
the company believes that materials that are recycled are commodities that are neither discarded nor disposed 
they are diverted by recyclers from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels would classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
the company has received notices from the us environmental protection agency epa or equivalent state agency that it is considered a potentially responsible party prp at thirteen sites  none owned by the company  and may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
the company is involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which the company is contesting  or at the appropriate time may contest  its prp designation 
in addition  the company has received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
some of these environmental matters or other proceedings may result in fines  penalties or judgments being assessed against the company which  from time to time  may have a material impact on earnings and cash flows for a particular quarter 
while the company is unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with the above referenced matters  it makes accruals as warranted 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the outcome of these proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the business or consolidated financial position of the company 
in fiscal  the company incurred environmental expense of million 
this included the cost to staff environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessment  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
the company estimates that approximately million of its capital expenditures for fiscal related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
the nature and timing of these environmental costs is such that it is not practical for the company to estimate their magnitude in future periods 
at august   million remained in accrued expenses for environmental liabilities 
dividends quarterly cash dividends have been paid in each of the past consecutive years 
the annual dividend in was cents a share paid at the rate of cents each quarter 
year the company s three operating segments  manufacturing  recycling  and marketing and trading combined with corporate  have undertaken management information system initiatives that address a broad spectrum of functionalities including the year issue  the ability of computer software to correctly interpret dates at the turn of the century 
the following is a discussion by segment of the status of each of these initiatives 

manufacturing 
the cmc steel group and the howell metal company have assessed their key financial and operational systems  and detail plans have been implemented to address modifications required by december  since fiscal year  the cmc steel group has been in preparation and implementation of a year compliant enterprise resource planning system 
this system covers all traditional financial systems and  in addition  covers sales  raw material usage  transportation management  purchasing  maintenance and other functional areas 
each of the four mills in the cmc steel group  smi texas  smi alabama  smi south carolina  and smi arkansas  have year task teams that meet periodically 
as of august   the mills systems implementation was more than complete with final completion scheduled by december  as of august   the mill task teams were well into verifying  validating and testing these systems as well as coordinating final contingency plans 
non mill operations have less formalized structures as the effect is significantly reduced 
as of august   letters of compliance have been received for all non mill systems  or upgrades are scheduled for completion by december all critical suppliers and vendors for both mill and non mill operations have submitted readiness letters or alternatives have been surveyed 
an infrastructure migration completed in july upgraded all personal computer hardware and software to common compliant platforms 
systems in place at the cmc steel group scrap yards  a relatively small portion of the cmc steel group  will be upgraded to a current release by december 
recycling 
the recycling segment has substantially completed a multi year transition plan of its systems for year compliance in each of the following categories mainframe computer hardware all current computers have been certified by the manufacturer as compliant 
outside of year issues  some older machines have been retired and replaced by certified compliant hardware 
workstation hardware personal computers have had chip replacements or been replaced where more cost effective 
business application software core applications developed in house have had conversion processes completed and are fully compliant 
outside package software for general ledger and payroll has been upgraded 
the fixed asset package is scheduled to be completed by the end of calendar year systems software the mainframe replacements discussed in point above have brought all operating systems up to a certified compliant version 
all pc s have had year patches installed  where required 
user level software and applications standard spreadsheet and word processing software has been upgraded to current versions 
there may remain pockets of applications that will still be discovered during the ordinary course of business  which will be addressed as uncovered 
communication equipment and software the segment wide communications equipment is now compliant 
non computer automated systems this is considered a minor risk and is completed with completion anticipated by the end of december 
marketing and trading  including corporate 
the marketing and trading segment  combined with the corporate functions  represent the most geographically dispersed operations of the company 
several systems were in place to address both financial applications and marketing information needs 
compliance evaluations begun two years ago indicated that generally the international divisions were compliant but reaching capacity constraints and that the domestic operations had sufficient size but were not compliant 
therefore  a joint program was developed to address both the functional marketing requirements and the financial systems with the goal to have the entire segment on a common platform with corporate 
separate teams were established for completing the upgrade process for both marketing and financials 
a common pc hardware and software platform has been established 
financial systems for domestic operations were rolled out  tested  and online in may alternatives for the joint marketing program are still being researched 
in the meantime  the existing trading management system has been reviewed and issues identified and corrected 
all operating systems will be updated and compliant by december 
summary 
the area of greatest risk is the readiness of the company s suppliers and vendors 
although appropriate inquiries have been made  there will be a factor of the unknown until january  the company has implemented the program described above with the use of internal personnel and outside consultants 
resources are considered available and adequate to meet the company s goals 
where necessary  contingency plans have been developed to address any anticipated shortfall 
minimal additional costs will be required to implement the remaining year compliance activities 
the section titled year contains forward looking statements regarding the company s expectations regarding addressing the year computer problem 
these plans among other factors include the timing of implementation phases  reallocation of in house resources  use of outside personnel  third party hardware and software  and reliance on representations of third parties 
there is inherent risk and uncertainty in any forward looking statements 
variances will occur and could be materially different from management s current opinion 
developments that could impact the company s expectations include the availability of company personnel  malfunctions of third party software and hardware  over which the company has no control  availability of outside consultants  and the inability to fully assess the readiness of key vendors and suppliers 
euro effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the existing sovereign currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries during the transition period ending on january  the company has adequate information systems for compliance with the requirements of this new currency 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of the euro will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
approach to minimizing market risk 
the company s product lines and its worldwide operations expose it to risks associated with fluctuations  sometimes volatile  in exchange and interest rates and commodity prices 
it employs various strategies to mitigate the effects of this volatility 
none of the instruments used are entered into for trading purposes or speculation  all are effected as hedges of underlying physical transactions 
the accompanying information mandated by the securities and exchange commission should be read in conjunction with footnotes and to the annual financial statements 

foreign exchange 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts as hedges of trade receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
effects of changes in currency rates are therefore minimized 
no single currency poses a primary risk to the company  fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
as a matter of company policy  foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge only firm commitments  not anticipated transactions 
certain information in the accompanying chart assumes that the foreign exchange contracts were settled at august   this would defeat their purpose as hedges on transactions that will not occur for some period after year end 
due to customary weight and quality settlements on physical transactions  small gains and losses do occur upon close of the foreign exchange contracts 

interest rates 
substantially all of the company s short and long term debt is denominated in united states dollars 
the company s financial results as affected by interest rates are most vulnerable to swings in short term commercial borrowing rates 
at august   approximately million australian dollars notional amount of debt was covered by an interest rate swap 
the swap is variable to fixed  terminating june   intending to match physical asset lives with debt provisions in one foreign subsidiary 
the variable rate at year end was and the fixed rate 
at august   it had a fair value of  
commodity prices 
pricing of certain firm sales and purchase commitments is fixed to forward metal commodity exchange quotes 
the company enters into metal commodity contracts for copper  aluminum  and zinc as hedges of gross margins on these commitments 
of these  copper is the most predominant 
the hedges are closed when the underlying sales and purchase commitments are priced  and gain or loss is recognized when the sale or purchase is recorded 
in general the company is most affected in periods of declining commodity prices as spreads narrow and sources withhold recycled metals from the market 
the settlement values expressed in the accompanying chart as of august   should be read with caution as the offsetting physical transactions for which the commodity futures are effective as hedges are not quantified 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses at settlement 
the following table provides certain information regarding the financial instruments discussed above
