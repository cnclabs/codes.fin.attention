inflation the company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  the company attempts to minimize any effects of inflation on its operating results by controlling operating costs and  whenever possible  seeking to insure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
among other issues  any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company is in the process of investigating the impact of year issues on its business  including the company s operational  information and financial systems eg general ledger  payroll  accounts receivable and payable  etc similarly  non informational systems  such as communication systems and security systems are also being reviewed 
as systems are evaluated and assessed  a detailed work plan is being developed to ensure that each area requiring modification or replacement is adequately and timely addressed 
at this time  the company s work plan continues to indicate that most significant areas have been or are scheduled to be remedied by december such work plan includes adequate time for remediation of the area  as well as testing to ensure the remediation efforts were complete 
additionally  the company has established an executive oversight committee to monitor implementation plans and to determine whether all areas have been assessed and evaluated  resources identified and remediation completed on a timely basis 
the company has initiated communications with significant suppliers and vendors on which the company relies in an effort to determine the extent to which the company s business is vulnerable to the failure by these third parties to remediate their year problems 
while the company has not been informed of any material risks associated with year issues of these entities  there can be no assurance that the computerized information systems of these third parties will be year compliant on a timely basis 
the inability of these third parties to remediate their year problems could have a material adverse impact on the company 
additionally  management noted some risk with legacy products marketed and maintained by the company  the vast majority of which have been delivered to the us government 
information collected to date regarding such legacy products indicates that while some products were designed with date and time functions  most products have been heavily modified by the licensee or by a third party integrator with whom the company has no obligatory agreement 
consequently  the company s exposure has been reduced 
however  the company will continue to evaluate these products and implement remediation plans  as deemed appropriate 
these products do not affect internal operations 
to date  management estimates that the total cost including hardware  software and services incurred by the company to evaluate  assess and remedy year issues  has been approximately  the expected future cost to complete evaluation  assessment and remediation of year issues  including replacement if necessary  is expected to range from  to  the company has expensed all internal costs related to the remediation of year issues 
the cost and the date on which the company plans to complete the year issue modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
the company s total year issue project cost and estimates to complete exclude the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue  which are not yet determinable 
it is difficult to accurately project what the potential risks and ramifications to the company may be  in the event timely remediation efforts are not completed by either the company or significant third parties 
in such an event  it is possible that the ability to maintain accurate and complete financial records of the company s activities and transactions may be impaired 
such events  should they occur  may significantly impair the company s ability to operate as it does today  creating business interruption  potential loss of business  and earnings and liquidity difficulties 
the company presently believes that with current and planned modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the risk of potential loss associated with the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
though the company s preliminary year issue work plan is believed to be adequate to achieve compliance on a timely basis  there may be circumstances that could prevent timely implementation 
accordingly  the company is designing its work plan to address this potential occurrence 
first  the work plan is being designed to ensure that the most critical systems and areas are addressed first  and in a manner that provides adequate time to remediate and test 
second  the company has secured external expert resources to assist in evaluation  assessment  prioritization and implementation of the work plan to further ensure its success 
the company will continue to monitor and adjust its contingency plan needs in conjunction with the progress made on the primary work plan

in october  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa released statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
among other things  sop eliminates the distinction between significant and insignificant vendor obligations promulgated by sop and requires each element of a software arrangement to meet certain criteria in order to recognize revenue allocated to that element 
additionally  sop requires that total fees under an arrangement be allocated to each element in the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence  as defined

the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sop and the subsequent sop will have a material effect on the company s results of operations
