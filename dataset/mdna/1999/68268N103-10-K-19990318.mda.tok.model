item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  operating revenue increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the results for the comparable period in operating revenue attributable to northern border pipeline increased million due primarily to returns on higher levels of invested equity 
northern border pipeline s ferc tariff provides an opportunity to recover all of the operations and maintenance costs of the pipeline  taxes other than income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  an allowance for income taxes and a regulated return on equity 
northern border pipeline is generally allowed to collect from its shippers a return on unrecovered rate base as well as recover that rate base through depreciation and amortization 
the return amount northern border pipeline collects from its shippers declines as the rate base is recovered 
as a result of placing the facilities for the chicago project into service  northern border pipeline added approximately million to its gas plant in service in see business the pipeline system 
operating revenue for black mesa was million in as compared to million in  which represented seven months of revenue 
on may   the partnership increased its ownership interest of black mesa and began to reflect its operating results on a consolidated basis 
prior to that time  black mesa was accounted for on the equity method and included in other income 
operations and maintenance expense increased million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in operations and maintenance expense for black mesa was million in as compared to million in  which represented seven months of expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to northern border pipeline increased million primarily due to facilities that were placed in service in depreciation and amortization expense for black mesa was million in as compared to million in  which represented seven months of expense 
for the year ended december   northern border pipeline recorded a regulatory credit of approximately million 
during the construction of the chicago project  northern border pipeline placed certain new facilities into service in advance of the december in service date to maintain gas flow at firm contracted capacity while existing facilities were being modified 
the regulatory credit results in deferral of the cost of service of these new facilities 
northern border pipeline is allowed to recover from its shippers the regulatory asset that resulted from the cost of service deferral over a ten year period commencing with the in service date of the chicago project 
interest expense  net increased slightly for the year ended december   as compared to the results for the same period in  due to an increase in interest expense of million offset by an increase in the amount of interest expense capitalized of million 
interest expense attributable to northern border pipeline and the partnership increased million due primarily to an increase in average debt outstanding  reflecting amounts borrowed to finance a portion of the capital expenditures for the chicago project 
the remainder of the increase in interest expense is from black mesa  which was million for as compared to million for seven months in the increase in interest expense capitalized primarily relates to northern border pipeline s expenditures for the chicago project 
other income increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to an million increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction 
the increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction primarily relates to northern border pipeline s expenditures for the chicago project 
other income for included million received by northern border pipeline for vacating certain microwave frequency bands 
minority interests in net income increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  due to increased net income for northern border pipeline 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  operating revenue decreased million for the year ended december   as compared to the results for the comparable period in operating revenue attributable to northern border pipeline decreased million due primarily to lower depreciation and amortization expense  taxes other than income and returns on a lower rate base 
additionally  in accordance with the stipulation approved by the ferc to settle northern border pipeline s november rate case  the allowed equity rate of return was through september  and thereafter see business ferc regulation cost of service tariff 
these lower recoveries were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense recoveries 
operating revenue for black mesa was million for operations and maintenance expense increased million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in due primarily to million of expense for black mesa 
operations and maintenance expense attributable to northern border pipeline increased million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in due primarily to higher administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in depreciation and amortization expense attributable to northern border pipeline decreased million 
in accordance with the terms of the stipulation  the depreciation rate applied to northern border pipeline s gross transmission plant was for the average depreciation rate applied to gross transmission plant for the year ended december  was 
depreciation and amortization expense for black mesa was million for taxes other than income decreased million for the year ended december   as compared to the results for the same period in taxes other than income attributable to northern border pipeline decreased million due primarily to lower property tax assessments received in various states where the pipeline system operates 
taxes other than income for black mesa was million for interest expense  net decreased million for the year ended december   as compared to the results for the same period in  due to an increase in interest expense of million offset by an increase in the amount of interest expense capitalized of million 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to black mesa 
the increase in interest expense capitalized primarily relates to northern border pipeline s expenditures for the chicago project 
other income increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to million received by northern border pipeline for vacating certain microwave frequency bands and a million increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction 
the increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction primarily relates to northern border pipeline s expenditures for the chicago project 
liquidity and capital resources general in june  northern border pipeline entered into a credit agreement pipeline credit agreement with certain financial institutions to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of million 
the pipeline credit agreement is comprised of a million five year revolving credit facility to be used for the retirement of northern border pipeline s bank loan agreements and for general business purposes  and a million three year revolving credit facility to be used for the construction of the chicago project 
the three year revolving credit facility may  if certain conditions are met  be converted to a term loan maturing in june northern border pipeline intends to  and has the ability to  convert the three year revolving credit facility to a term loan in at december   million and million had been borrowed on the five year and three year revolving credit facilities  respectively 
in november  the partnership entered into a credit agreement partnership credit agreement with certain financial institutions to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of million under a revolving credit facility 
the partnership credit agreement is to be used for interim funding of the partnership s required capital contributions to northern border pipeline for construction of the chicago project 
the amount available under the partnership credit agreement is reduced to the extent the partnership issues additional limited partner interests to fund the partnership s capital contributions for the chicago project in excess of million 
the public offerings of common units discussed in the following paragraph reduced the amount available under the partnership credit agreement to million 
the maturity date of the partnership credit agreement will be november if northern border pipeline converts its million three year revolving credit facility to a term loan  otherwise the maturity date is june at december   million had been borrowed on the partnership credit agreement 
in december  the partnership sold  through an underwritten public offering   common units 
in conjunction with the issuance of the common units  the partnership s general partners made capital contributions to the partnership to maintain a general partner interest in accordance with the partnership agreements 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used by the partnership to fund a portion of the capital contributions to northern border pipeline for construction of the chicago project 
as part of the underwritten public offering  the partnership granted the underwriters an over allotment option to purchase a limited number of additional common units 
this option was exercised on january   and the partnership sold an additional  common units resulting in additional net proceeds  including the general partners capital contributions  of approximately million 
in september  northern border pipeline executed interest rate forward agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million to hedge the interest rate for a planned issuance of fixed rate debt during northern border pipeline plans to use the proceeds from the debt borrowing to repay amounts borrowed on the pipeline credit agreement 
in february  the partnership filed two registration statements with the securities and exchange commission sec 
one registration statement was for a proposed offering of million in common units and debt securities to be used by the partnership for general business purposes including repayment of debt  future acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital 
the other registration statement was for a proposed offering of  common units that are presently owned by northwest border  a general partner  and panhandle eastern pipe line company  of which the partnership will not receive any proceeds 
short term liquidity needs will be met by internal sources and through the lines of credit discussed above 
long term capital needs may be met through the ability to issue long term indebtedness as well as additional limited partner interests of the partnership either through the registration statements previously discussed or separate registrations 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily related to a million reduction for changes in other current assets and liabilities partially offset by the effect of the refund activity in discussed below 
for the year ended december   the changes in other current assets and liabilities reflected a decrease in accounts payable of million as compared to an increase of million in  exclusive of accruals for the chicago project 
in addition  the changes in other current assets and liabilities for reflected a decrease in over recovered cost of service of million and an increase in under recovered cost of service of million 
the over under recovered cost of service is the difference between northern border pipeline s estimated billings to its shippers  which are determined on a six month cycle  and the actual cost of service determined in accordance with the ferc tariff 
the difference is either billed to or credited back to the shippers accounts 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily related to a million refund in october in accordance with the stipulation approved by the ferc to settle northern border pipeline s november rate case 
during  million had been collected subject to refund by northern border pipeline as a result of its rate case 
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   include million for the chicago project see business the pipeline system and million for linepack gas 
the remaining million of capital expenditures for is primarily related to renewals and replacements of existing facilities 
for the comparable period in  capital expenditures were million  which included million for the chicago project and million primarily related to renewals and replacements of northern border pipeline s existing facilities 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be million including million for project see business future demand and competition and million for the chicago project 
approximately million of the capital expenditures for the chicago project is for construction completed in an additional million of capital expenditures is planned for renewals and replacements of the existing facilities 
northern border pipeline anticipates funding its capital expenditures primarily by borrowing on the pipeline credit agreement and using working capital 
funds required to meet the remainder of northern border pipeline s capital expenditures will be provided primarily from capital contributions from the partnership and minority interest holders 
the partnership intends to use a combination of proceeds from the sale of common units  capital contributions from its general partners and borrowings on the partnership credit agreement to finance its capital contributions to northern border pipeline 
the partnership anticipates selling additional common units to repay amounts borrowed on the partnership credit agreement to finance capital contributions for the chicago project 
cash flows provided by acquisition and consolidation of businesses of million for the year ended december   are related primarily to the consolidation of black mesa s cash balance 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in financing activities for include borrowings under the pipeline credit agreement and partnership credit agreement totaling million and were used primarily for construction expenditures related to the chicago project 
in  borrowings under the pipeline credit agreement totaled million and were used primarily to retire amounts related to northern border pipeline s existing bank loan agreements of million and for construction expenditures related to the chicago project 
financing activities for reflect million in net proceeds from the issuance of  common units and a related capital contribution by the partnership s general partners in january in  financing activities reflect million in net proceeds from the issuance of  common units and a related capital contribution by the partnership s general partners in december contributions received from minority interests increased million to million and were used by northern border pipeline to fund a portion of its capital expenditures 
distributions to minority interests decreased million to million primarily due to a change in the timing of northern border pipeline s distributions 
year the partnership and its subsidiaries  similar to most businesses  rely heavily on information systems technology to operate in an efficient and effective manner 
much of this technology takes the form of computers and associated hardware for data processing and analysis  but  in addition  a great deal of information processing technology is embedded in microelectronic devices 
the year problem results from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the effects of the year problem are compounded because of the interdependence of computer and telecommunication systems in the united states and throughout the world 
this interdependence is true for the partnership  its subsidiaries and their respective suppliers and customers 
the partnership and its subsidiaries have developed a plan  which will be modified as events warrant  to address year problems the plan 
the plan is designed to take reasonable steps to prevent mission critical functions from being impaired due to the year problem 
mission critical functions are those critical functions whose loss would cause an immediate stoppage of or significant impairment to major business areas a major business area is one of material importance to the partnership s and its subsidiaries businesses 
the partnership and its subsidiaries are committed to allocating the resources necessary to implement the plan 
a core team of individuals has been established to implement and complete the plan the yk team 
the plan includes developing a comprehensive component inventory of computer hardware  software  embedded chips and third party interfaces  assessing the risk of non compliance of each component  identifying the impact of any component failure  assessing year compliance of each component  identifying and implementing solutions for non compliance of components  testing of solutions implemented  and developing contingency plans for mission critical components and systems 
as of february  computer software  hardware  embedded chips  and third party interfaces have been identified  inventoried  and assessed 
where necessary  remediation  replacement  or adequate work arounds have been identified and implemented or are in the process of being implemented 
testing of computer hardware  software  and embedded systems is ongoing and is expected to be substantially completed early in the second quarter of the plan recognizes that the computer  telecommunications and other systems outside systems of outside entities outside entities have the potential for major  mission critical  adverse effects on the conduct of the partnership s and its subsidiaries businesses 
the partnership and its subsidiaries do not have control of these outside systems 
however  the plan includes an ongoing process of identifying and contacting outside entities whose systems have or may have a substantial effect on the partnership s and its subsidiaries ability to continue to conduct the mission critical aspects of their businesses without disruption from year problems 
the plan requires the partnership and its subsidiaries to attempt to inventory and assess the extent to which these outside systems may not be year compatible 
the yk team will attempt reasonably to coordinate with these outside entities in an ongoing effort to obtain assurances these outside systems will be year compatible well before january  a listing of critical outside entities has been developed which includes shippers  electrical suppliers  and interconnecting pipelines 
currently  the yk team is in the process of contacting these entities to determine their year readiness and the extent to which joint testing or mutual contingency planning is required 
the assessment of the year readiness of outside entities is an important factor in the internal contingency planning process 
the processes of inventorying  assessing  analyzing  remediating through replacement or adequate work arounds  testing  and developing contingency plans for mission critical functions in anticipation of the year are necessarily iterative processes 
that is  the steps are repeated as the yk team learns more about the year problem and its effects on internal systems and on outside systems  and about the effects that embedded chips may have on the partnership s and its subsidiaries systems and outside systems 
as the steps are repeated  it is likely that new problems will be identified and addressed 
the partnership and its subsidiaries anticipate that they will continue with these processes through january  and  if necessary based on experience  into the year in order to assess and remediate problems that reasonably can be identified only after the start of the new century 
as part of the implementation of the plan  the yk team has developed a contingency plan to minimize the consequences of potential problems that have not been identified or that cannot be remediated before january  the contingency plan concentrates on those areas that are essential to continuing business operations and or safety of its personnel and the public 
these areas include  but are not limited to  systems that are used to operate and control the pipeline system and enable the physical transportation of natural gas 
the contingency plan includes the creation of teams that will be standing by on december   prepared to respond rapidly and otherwise as necessary to mission critical year related problems as soon as they become known 
the composition of teams that are assigned to deal with year problems will vary according to the mission critical nature and location of the problem 
the contingency plan is dynamic and will be continually revised as potential new problem areas are identified and areas are remediated 
the partnership and its subsidiaries have not incurred material historical costs associated with the year issues 
further  the partnership and its subsidiaries anticipate that their future costs of implementing the plan will not be material 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance  for the reasons stated in the following paragraph  that the actual costs of implementing the plan will not differ materially from the estimated costs or that the partnership and its subsidiaries will not be adversely affected by year issues 
the extent and magnitude of the year problem as it may affect the partnership and its subsidiaries  both before and for some period after january   are difficult to predict or quantify for a number of reasons 
among the most important is the potential complexity of locating embedded microprocessors that may be in a great variety of hardware used for process or flow control  environmental  transportation  access  communications and other systems 
the partnership and its subsidiaries believe that they will be able to identify and remediate mission critical systems containing embedded microprocessors or will have contingency plans to deal with these systems 
other important difficulties relate to the lack of control over and difficulty inventorying  assessing  remediating  verifying and testing outside systems  the complexity of evaluating all software computer code internal to the partnership and its subsidiaries that may not be year compatible  and the potential limited availability of certain necessary internal or external resources  including but not limited to trained hardware and software engineers  technicians and other personnel to perform adequate remediation  verification and testing of internal systems or outside systems 
year costs are difficult to estimate accurately because of unanticipated vendor delays  technical difficulties  the impact of tests of outside systems  and similar events 
there can be no assurance for example that all outside systems will be adequately remediated so that they are year ready by january   or by some earlier date  so as not to create a material disruption to business 
if  despite diligent  prudent efforts under the plan  there are year related failures that create substantial disruptions to the partnership and its subsidiaries businesses  the adverse impact could be material 
moreover  the estimated costs of pursuing the current course of action do not take into account the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of year related failures that occur despite implementation of the plan  as it may be modified over time 
in a recent sec release regarding year disclosures  the sec stated that public companies must disclose the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
analysis of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios the partnership may face leads to contemplation of the following possibilities widespread failure of electrical  gas  and similar supplies by utilities serving the partnership  widespread disruption of the services of communications common carriers  similar disruption to means and modes of transportation for the partnership and its employees  contractors  suppliers  and customers  significant disruption to the partnership s ability to gain access to  and remain working in  office buildings and other facilities  the failure of substantial numbers of the partnership s mission critical information computer hardware and software systems  including both internal business systems and systems such as those with embedded chips controlling operational facilities such as electrical generation  transmission  and distribution systems  and the failure of outside systems  the effects of which would have a cumulative material adverse impact on the partnership s mission critical systems 
among other things  the partnership could face substantial claims due to service interruptions  inability to fulfill contractual obligations  inability to account for certain revenues or obligations or to bill shippers accurately and on a timely basis  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following mission critical failures  and the execution of contingency plans 
the partnership could also experience an inability by shippers to pay  on a timely basis or at all  obligations owed to the partnership 
under these circumstances  the adverse effect on the partnership  and the diminution of the partnership s revenues  would be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
the partnership will continue to monitor business conditions with the aim of assessing and quantifying material adverse effects  if any  that result or may result from the year problem 
information regarding forward looking statements statements in this annual report that are not historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such forward looking statements include the discussions under business future demand and competition and elsewhere regarding northern border pipeline s efforts to pursue opportunities to further increase its capacity  the discussion under business shippers regarding potential contract extensions  the discussion under business ferc regulation cost of service tariff regarding a project cost containment mechanism related to the chicago project and the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
although the partnership believes that its expectations regarding future events are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business  it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved or that its expectations regarding future developments will be realized 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include industry results  future demand for natural gas  availability of supplies of canadian natural gas  political and regulatory developments that impact ferc proceedings involving northern border pipeline  northern border pipeline s success in sustaining its positions in such proceedings or the success of intervenors in opposing northern border pipeline s positions  northern border pipeline s ability to replace its rate base as it is depreciated and amortized  developments relating to the renewal of the pipeline right of way lease within the fort peck indian reservation and right of way grants involving allotted lands of the reservation  competitive developments by canadian and us natural gas transmission peers  political and regulatory developments in canada  conditions of the capital markets and equity markets  and the partnership s ability to successfully implement the year plan during the periods covered by the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership s interest rate exposure results from its variable rate borrowings from commercial banks 
to mitigate potential fluctuations in interest rates  the partnership maintains a significant portion of its consolidated debt portfolio in fixed rate debt 
the partnership also uses interest rate swap agreements to increase the portion of its fixed rate debt and uses interest rate forward agreements to establish an approximate effective borrowing rate for anticipated long term debt issuances 
if interest rates average one percentage point more than rates in effect as of december   the partnership s consolidated annual interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the partnership s variable rate borrowings and interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  approximately million of this increase would result from applying the hypothetical interest rates to northern border pipeline s outstanding debt portfolio 
northern border pipeline s tariff provides the pipeline an opportunity to recover  among other items  interest expense 
therefore  the partnership believes that northern border pipeline would be allowed to recover the increase in its interest expense  if it were to occur 
thus  the estimated impact on the partnership s annual earnings and cash flow from a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would be a reduction of approximately million related to interest expense on borrowings other than by northern border pipeline
