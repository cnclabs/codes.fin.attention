the reduction in gross margins in from was primarily due to lower volumes and increased pricing pressure in the equipment business  and  to a lesser extent the negative gross margin incurred on the first rigel flat panel sputtering system acceptance and a greater percentage of net revenues being derived from electron beam processing equipment and contract research and development in the photonics business  both of which currently generate gross margins below those generated by disk equipment 
the reduction in gross margins in from was primarily due to reduced margins on equipment  primarily disk sputtering systems  for which product costs increased more than the company s ability to increase prices 
gross margins declined from during the third quarter of to during the fourth quarter of additions to inventory reserves  low volume and a greater percentage of revenue derived from contract research and development were the primary reasons for the decline in gross margins

in january  the company acquired the four used mdp b systems from stormedia for resale 
the company plans to deliver these systems during the first half of and expects that there will be little contribution to gross margin from these systems which were re marketed at values approximating cost

the million increase from to was caused primarily by higher expenses related to development of disk equipment  partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to development of flat panel equipment

the company may also from time to time consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional financing

year the company is preparing for the impact of the arrival of the year on its business  as well as on the business of its customers  suppliers and business partners 
the year issue is a term used to describe the problems created by systems that are unable to accurately interpret dates after december  these problems are derived predominately from the fact that many software programs have historically categorized years in a two digit format 
the year issue creates potential risks for the company  including potential problems in the company s products as well as in the information technology it and non it systems that the company uses in its business operations 
the company may also be exposed to risks from third parties with which the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own year issues 
intevac is in the process of implementing plans to address year issues both within and outside the company 
in addressing the year issues and risks  the company has focused  and will continue to focus  its efforts on the company s enterprise wide and departmental operations  products  critical suppliers including service providers and key customers 
within intevac  these efforts are intended to encompass all major categories of computer systems in use by the company  including those utilized in manufacturing  engineering  sales  finance and human resources 
the company s risk assessment includes understanding the year readiness of its critical suppliers 
the company s risk assessment process associated with critical suppliers includes soliciting and analyzing responses to questionnaires  and  where necessary  follow up with the supplier 
the company is utilizing a phased approach to identifying and remediating year issues 
the first phase  compiling an inventory of all systems that face risks from year issues  was substantially completed by year end the evaluation  remediation and validation implementation phases are expected to be complete by mid for all areas 
the company is acting to remedy issues as they are revealed  while it simultaneously completes its assessment of year risks 
corrective actions completed to date include the implementation of system upgrades to the company s materials and financial software  upgrades to file server operating systems and replacement of payroll and human resource software 
the company also issued a product information bulletin to customers outlining the year issues faced by the company s principal product  the mdp sputtering system  and proposed fixes 
cost incurred to date in addressing year issues have not been material 
based on assessment and correction projects underway  the company does not expect the total cost of addressing the year issue to be material 
as the company s risk assessment and correction activities continue  these cost estimates may change 
in addition  the company s total cost estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims resulting from the company s failure to adequately correct year issues 
although the company does not currently expect any significant disruption to its operations or operating results as a result of year issues  the company is taking all steps it believes are appropriate to identify and resolve any year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  assess and correct year issues in a timely or successful manner 
the company s failure to identify  assess and correct year issues in a timely manner could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company currently believes that its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would relate to problems with systems of third parties which would create the greatest risks with infrastructure  including water and sewer services  electricity  transportation  telecommunications and critical suppliers of materials and supplies 
the company has not yet prepared a contingency plan for dealing with these potential problems 
the company will be assessing various scenarios and will prepare the necessary contingency plan over the course of the foregoing statements regarding the company s year plans and the company s expectation for resolving these issues and costs associated therewith are forward looking statements and actual results could vary 
the company s success in addressing year issues could be impacted by the severity of the problems to be resolved within the company  by year issues affecting its suppliers and service providers and by the costs associated with third party consultants and software necessary to address these issues 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio

short term investments typically consist of investments in tax exempt market auction rate preferred municipal bonds

fair beyond total value in thousands cash equivalents variable rate    average rate short term investments variable rate    average rate total investments securities    average rate long term debt fixed rate     average rate foreign exchange risk 
from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to economically hedge certain of its anticipated foreign currency transaction  translation and re measurement exposures 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
at december   the company had approximately million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts denominated in yen  which have not been designated as hedge contracts for accounting purposes 
these contracts expire at various dates through the third quarter of the following table provides information about the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  average estimated notional contract fair amount rate value in thousands except contract rate foreign currency forward exchange contracts japanese yen
