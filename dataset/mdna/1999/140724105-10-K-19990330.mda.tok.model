inflation the company s leases contain provisions which mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
the leases generally provide for specified periodic rent increases including fixed increase amounts and  in limited circumstances  indexation to cpi and or percentage rent 
in addition  most of the leases require the lessee to pay all operating costs and expenses including repairs  maintenance  real property taxes  assessments  utilities and insurance  thereby substantially reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates see note of the financial statements 
year the year issue is a result of the way computer programs historically manipulate date information based on a two digit year instead of 
the issue is that the year designation can potentially cause miscalculations or failures within the computer system if is misinterpreted as the year instead of the year these failures could potentially lead to temporary disruption of operations and the inability to conduct normal business activities 
the company predominantly uses standard application software supported by third party vendors 
information has been obtained from key third party financial software vendors that comprise the core business applications indicating that the core software systems are currently year compliant 
the company is in the process of identifying key business partners  such as financial institutions and lessees  to assess their status of year readiness 
upon completion of the assessment process  a strategy on how to address each partner will be developed based on the relative importance of each relationship 
the company s major software applications are currently year compliant  and the core computing infrastructure including personal computers and network server hardware and software are all compliant 
therefore  the company does not anticipate the total cost of year compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company has incurred minimal costs to date related to year compliance 
the failure to identify and correct material year problems adequately could result in an interruption to or failure of certain normal business activities or operations 
these interruptions or failures could adversely affect the company s financial condition  however  the extent of the impact can not presently be determined 
the company is dependent upon the year readiness information provided by its vendors and external business partners  and their ability to achieve year compliance with their computer systems
