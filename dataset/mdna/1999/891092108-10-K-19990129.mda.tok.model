to mitigate the risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will generally enter into forward currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a currency 
decisions on whether to use forward currency exchange contracts to hedge transactions exposed to foreign exchange rate changes are made based on the amount of those exposures  by currency  and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
these instruments used as hedges are managed to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract 
accordingly  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are recorded on the consolidated statements of earnings
