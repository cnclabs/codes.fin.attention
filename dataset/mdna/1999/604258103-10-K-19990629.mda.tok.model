in may  the company signed a letter of intent with an oncologist to acquire the rights to commercialize the physician s patented cancer therapy  as well as the physician s clinic 
the company expects its cash balances  cash flow from operations  and line of credit to be adequate to meet its obligations to complete this acquisition  and other anticipated operating cash needs including planned capital expenditures in its core business in fiscal year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result of this issue  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions involving the recording of sales  manufacture of products  management of inventory and distribution  preparation of invoices and collection of accounts receivable 
the company s management has established a program to address the year issue in three phases as follows a an assessment phase  b an analysis and resolution strategy phase  and c a remediation and testing phase 
the compliance program focuses on the company s information technology systems as well as non information technology systems such systems contain embedded technology in manufacturing  laboratory  or process control equipment containing microprocessors or other similar circuitry 
the assessment phase  during which management attempted to identify all hardware and software that affect the company s operations  has been completed with respect to the majority of the company s operations 
based on the results of the assessment phase  the company has determined that its primary hardware and operating system software is year compliant 
in addition  the company s internal financial and enterprise resource planning systems are compliant 
management has determined that certain hardware and software will need to be updated or replaced so that its information systems will properly recognize dates after december  the company is currently in the remediation phase for most of its information technology systems 
for non information technology  or embedded technology systems  the company is in the assessment  analysis and resolution strategy phase 
the company anticipates that internal year remediation projects will be completed and tested by july  in addition  the company has reviewed and requested assurances on the status of year readiness of its critical suppliers 
many of these suppliers have either declined to provide  or have limited their assurances on the status of year readiness 
the company will continue to monitor critical suppliers 
the company is in the process of assessing the year readiness of major customers and their year status is unclear 
if a significant number of suppliers and customers experience disruptions as a result of year issues  this could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is currently developing contingency plans and scenarios  and anticipates that such plans will be completed by september  through march   the company has spent approximately 
million for year remediation 
based on the status of assessments and re mediation plans to date  the company estimates the total remaining cost of remediation at less than 
million 
the company believes it has ample resources to fund and complete remediation and testing 
however  estimates of year costs are based on numerous assumptions  and there can be no assurance that the estimates are correct or that the actual costs will not be materially greater than anticipated 
based on its assessments and current knowledge  the company believes it will not  as a result of the year issue  experience any material disruptions in internal manufacturing processes  information processing or interfaces with major customers  or with processing orders and billing 
however  if certain critical third party providers  such as providers of electricity  water or telephone service experience difficulties resulting in disruption of service to the company  a shutdown of the company s operations at individual facilities could occur for the duration of the disruption 
the company s management will establish a contingency plan to provide for continuity of processing if the company s year compliance efforts fail 
assuming no major disruption in service from utility companies or other critical third party providers  the company believes that year compliance will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
foreign currency transactions substantially all of the company s united states based export sales are invoiced and paid in united states dollars 
the transactions of the company s netherlands based subsidiary are invoiced and paid in several currencies  including dutch guilders  german marks and united states dollars 
the company does not currently hedge its foreign currency transactions 
accordingly  the company is subject to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
risk factors certain statements made in this annual report on form k  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include those identified below 
competition  uncertainty of technological change 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive and are characterized by innovation and technological change 
the company currently competes in each area of the company s business with a number of companies that have capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  experience in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  and experience in manufacturing and marketing medical supplies and devices that are significantly greater than those of the company 
in addition  there are several companies developing new technologies that may reduce the demand for the company s existing products  such as minimally invasive techniques in open heart surgery  which may not require the use of oxygenators 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any that are being developed by the company or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  certain of the company s competitors may achieve patent protection  regulatory approval or product commercialization that would limit the company s ability to compete 
the company s inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
reliance on patents and proprietary technology 
the company relies heavily on proprietary technology  which it protects primarily through licensing arrangements  patents  trade secrets  and proprietary know how 
the company holds patents and has pending patent applications that cover certain aspects of its technology 
there can be no assurance that any pending or future patent applications will be granted or that any current or future patents  regardless of whether the company is an owner or a licensee of such patent  will not be challenged  rendered unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder or under its licensing agreements will provide a competitive advantage to the company 
there can also be no assurance that the company s trade secrets or non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of the company s proprietary information 
furthermore  there can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by the company or that the company s technology will not infringe upon patents or other rights owned by others 
the company s inability to maintain its proprietary rights would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
lack of market acceptance 
the company s principal products are based upon innovative medical concepts 
the company believes that market acceptance of these products will depend  in part  on the company s ability to convince the medical community of the safety  efficacy  convenience  and cost effectiveness of these products as compared to existing competitive products 
market acceptance will further depend on the company s ability to gain acceptance by the medical community of the use of its products 
there can be no assurance that medical professionals will readily adopt new products or approaches  particularly when certain competitors of the company provide a more complete product mix than that offered by the company 
the company s inability to gain market acceptance for its biocor registered trademark oxygenator and other products would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
litigation  potential for adverse outcomes 
the medical supply and device market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation 
intellectual property litigation is complex and expensive  and the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict 
a finding against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
government regulation 
in the united states  the fda regulates the sale of medical supplies and devices as well as manufacturing procedures  labeling  and recordkeeping with respect to such products 
the process of obtaining marketing clearances and approvals from the fda for new products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize its products 
the fda requires that a new product secure either a k clearance or an approved pma  depending upon its classification  prior to marketing in the united states 
the company s products are currently sold under a k clearance  which is available for products demonstrated to be substantially equivalent to products that are already commercially available 
the k clearance process typically takes several months and may require the submission of supporting laboratory or clinical data 
no assurance can be given that the company will receive fda marketing approval for new products on a timely basis  or at all 
even if regulatory approvals to market a product are obtained from the fda  such approvals may entail limitations on the indicated uses of the product 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
a product recall  whether voluntary or mandated by the fda  would have a material adverse effect on the company  particularly at the early stage of market introduction 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies  with possible retroactive effect  will not adversely affect the company 
the fda  various state agencies  and foreign regulatory agencies inspect the company from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency regulates the chemical sterilants used in the company s water filtration product line 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of civil penalties  including fines  product recall orders or product seizures  and  in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
international regulatory bodies often establish varying regulations governing products standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of the company s sales in europe  the company was required to be certified as iso compliant and to receive ce mark certification 
failure to maintain ce mark certification would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
limitations on third party reimbursement 
the company s ability to sell its products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments are available to patients under domestic and foreign governmental health programs  private health insurance  managed care organizations  workers compensation insurers  and other similar programs 
over the past decade  the cost of health care has risen significantly  and there have been numerous proposals by legislators  regulators  and third party health care payors to curb these costs 
in addition  certain health care providers are moving towards a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party health care payors 
in addition  hospitals and other health care providers have become increasingly price competitive and  in some instances  have put pressure on medical suppliers to lower their prices 
any reductions in coverage or price limitations by third party payors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
product liability 
the medical supply and device industry has been historically litigious and the company faces an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products results in personal injury 
since the company s principal products are designed to be used in connection with medical procedures on the human body  manufacturing errors or design defects could result in an unsafe condition  injury or death to the patient  and could result in a recall of the company s products and substantial monetary damages 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience losses due to product liability claims in the future 
although the company currently maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
any claims against the company  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business financial condition  and results of operations 
acquisition of customers by competitors of the company 
a significant percentage of dialysis treatment centers nationwide are owned by competitors of the company 
accordingly  the company may face difficulty in selling its dialysis products to these centers 
additionally  a competitor has recently acquired a number of companies that provide contract perfusion services to hospitals 
although the company believes that it is too early to assess the long term effects of these acquisitions on its business  the company may face difficulty in selling its cardiosurgery products to perfusionists employed by these companies or to hospitals or clinics that contract with them 
these acquisitions or other acquisitions by the company s competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on distributor sales 
sales to distributors constitute a significant portion of the company s business both in the us and foreign markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its relationship with distributors  or  if these relationships terminate  that new distributors will be found 
the loss of a significant distributor could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations if a new distributor or other suitable sales organization could not be found on a timely basis 
interruption in sources of supply 
the fiber used in the company s oxygenators is purchased from a single source 
if this source of supply becomes unavailable  then there can be no assurance that the company would be able to find an acceptable substitute supplier 
in addition  high demand for polycarbonate products by various industries has at times caused temporary shortages of their supply 
any significant interruption in the supply of these products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
environmental compliance 
in the ordinary course of its manufacturing process  the company uses various chemical solvents and other regulated substances 
although the company is not aware of any claim involving violation of environmental or occupational health and safety laws or regulations  there can be no assurance that such a claim may not arise in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
currency risk 
approximately percent of the company s business is transacted in foreign markets 
long term changes or short term fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on significant customers 
the company s five largest customers in fiscal accounted for percent of its total sales 
the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s oxygenator supply contract with bard ended june  although the company plans to supplant the lost revenues from bard under this contract with sales of its biocor registered trademark oxygenator  there can be no assurance that these plans will be realized 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  management  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development and operation of its business 
the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
possible volatility of share price 
market prices for securities of medical technology companies are highly volatile and the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations by the company or its competitors  government regulation  and other events or factors  including the various risk actors discussed herein 
in addition  market prices of securities of medical technology companies have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover considerations 
the board of directors of the company has the authority  without any action by the shareholders  to fix the rights and preferences of any shares of the company s preferred stock to be issued from time to time 
in addition  as a minnesota corporation  the company is subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the minnesota business corporation act the mbca 
the authority of the board with regard to the preferred stock and the provisions of the mbca could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for the company s common stock at a premium over the then prevailing market price of the common stock  and may adversely effect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  common stock 
volatility of global markets 
the company and its subsidiary operate in a global market 
global operations are subject to risks  including political and economic instability  general economic conditions  imposition of government controls  fluctuations of exchange rates  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and united states export laws  trade restrictions and the greater difficulty of administering business overseas 
although substantially all of the company s direct international sales are denominated in united states dollars  both direct sales by the company and sales through its affiliated international distributors may be affected by these factors and thus may adversely affect the operations and financial results of the company 
year issues 
certain of the company s information systems and products may require updating to continue to function properly beyond the company believes that adequate resources have been allocated for this purpose and does not expect to incur significant expenditures to address this issue 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will identify all year compliance issues in its information systems and products in advance of their occurrence or that the company will be able to remedy successfully any problems that are discovered 
the expenses of the company s efforts to address such problems  or the expenses or liabilities to which the company may become subject as a result of such problems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations  in addition  the revenue stream and financial stability of existing customers may be adversely impacted by year compliance problems  which could cause fluctuations in the company s revenue and operating results
