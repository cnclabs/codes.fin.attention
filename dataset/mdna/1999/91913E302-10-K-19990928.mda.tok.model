the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in this section as well as under item business  including risk factors 
overview on march   megabios corp 
completed its merger with genemedicine  inc genemedicine 
on april   the combined company was renamed valentis  inc the company 
each outstanding share of genemedicine common stock was converted into of a share of the common stock of the company 
the merger resulted in the issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock  valued at million 
the purchase price also included approximately  related to outstanding genemedicine stock options and outstanding warrants assumed by the company and million of transaction costs  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the merger transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
a write off of million for in process research and development acquired from genemedicine was included in the company s statement of operations see detailed discussion of acquisition of genemedicine research and development programs below 
the intangible assets acquired will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of years 
with the acquisition of london based polymasc pharmaceuticals plc polymasc  in august  valentis expanded its delivery technologies and has a more diversified portfolio of products in clinical and preclinical development 
the acquisition broadened valentis intellectual property portfolio in biologics delivery  creating what it believes is the first company offering a broad array of technologies and intellectual property in biologics delivery 
polymasc  a wholly owned subsidiary of valentis  will continue to operate in its london location and focuses primarily on research and preclinical development of pegylation technologies and products 
pegylation is an established technology that involves the attachment of the polymer polyethyleneglycol peg to therapeutics to alter their pharmacokinetics distribution in the body  metabolism and excretion 
the alteration of the pharmacokinetics of biologics due to pegylation can lead to improved dosing intervals and may also have beneficial effects on safety and efficacy 
valentis is conducting operations in california  texas and london 
the company expects an increase in both research and administrative expenditures in future periods 
the company develops proprietary technologies and applies its preclinical and early clinical development expertise to create novel therapeutics 
the company s core technologies include multiple gene delivery and gene expression systems and pegylation technologies designed to improved the safety  efficacy and dosing characteristics of genes  proteins  peptides  peptidomimetics peptide like small molecules  antibodies and replicating and non replicating viruses 
these technologies are covered by a broad patent portfolio that includes issued us and european claims 
this expanded portfolio of delivery technologies allows valentis to maintain its focus on creating improved versions of currently marketed products as well as solving safety  efficacy and compliance issues with biologics in development 
valentis commercial strategy is to enter into corporate collaborations for full scale clinical development and marketing and sales of products 
valentis itself  or through its polymasc subsidiary  currently has corporate collaborations with roche holdings ltd 
roche for cancer immunotherapeutics  eli lilly co 
lilly to develop treatments for breast and ovarian cancer using the brca gene  glaxo wellcome plc glaxo wellcome to develop a treatment for cystic fibrosis using the cftr gene  transkaryotic therapies inc for pegylation of certain proteins  onyx pharmaceuticals inc for a pegylated virus based cancer therapeutic  bayer corporation for a pegylated factor viii  and dsm biologics and qiagen nv for plasmid manufacturing to date  substantially all revenue has been generated by collaborative research and development agreements from corporate partners  and no revenue has been generated from product sales 
under the terms of its corporate collaborations the company generally receives research and development funding on a quarterly basis in advance of associated research and development costs 
the company expects that future revenue will be derived in the short term from research and development agreements and milestone payments and in the long term from royalties on product sales 
the company has incurred significant losses since inception and expects to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to the expansion of its research and development programs and because the company does not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future  if at all 
the company expects that operating results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of june   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
results of operations fiscal years ended june    and revenue the company s research and development revenue totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the revenue was attributable to amounts earned for collaborative research and development performed under the company s corporate collaborations with roche and lilly  totaling approximately million and million  respectively  a  milestone payment earned from dsm biologics  and  earned under sbir grants 
the revenue was attributable primarily to amounts earned for research and development performed under the company s corporate collaborations with pfizer and lilly  totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
the revenue was primarily attributable to amounts earned for research and development performed under the company s corporate collaborations with glaxo wellcome  pfizer and lilly totaling approximately million  million and  respectively 
no revenue from royalties from product sales has been earned under any corporate collaboration to date 
expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million in and million in the increases in were primarily attributable to the additions of staff  facilities and projects resulting from the merger with genemedicine in march the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased headcount costs  increased purchases of laboratory supplies and materials  increased depreciation from additional equipment and leasehold improvements and the increased use of consultants and other services to support the company s research and development activities 
in addition  in march  the company purchased patent rights and an exclusive license to certain technology from the university of pittsburgh 
in partial consideration for this exclusive license  the company issued  shares of its common stock to the university of pittsburgh 
the value of the common stock issued in the transaction was million  which was expensed to research and development during the period 
the company expensed the value of this common stock as the technology was not complete at the date of acquisition 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase as the company continues to expand its independent and collaborative research and development programs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to the additions of staff and facilities and the costs of producing the company s first annual report to stockholders 
the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to increased administrative headcount and costs associated with being a newly public company 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to increase due to business development activities and to support expanded research and development activities 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net was million in  million in and million in the decrease in interest income expense  net in compared to resulted primarily from increased interest expenses on higher outstanding balances on the company s equipment financing lines of credit 
the increase in compared to resulted primarily from the increase in average cash and investment balances as a result of million in net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in september partially offset by higher outstanding balances on an equipment financing line of credit 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments compared to million at june  included in the company s cash  cash equivalents and securities balances is million of cash and short term investments acquired pursuant to the merger with genemedicine on march  net cash used in the company s operations was million in  million in and million in cash was used primarily to fund increasing levels of research and development and general and administrative activities 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in in june  the company established a line of credit for  with a commercial bank 
at june   the outstanding balance was million under the line of credit 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  the entire balance was converted into term loans at interest rates ranging from to due in equal monthly installments 
the loans are secured by tangible personal property  other than the assets securing the equipment financing  accounts receivable and funds on deposit 
as a condition of the credit line  the company must maintain a minimum cash and short term investments balance of not less than the greater of the prior two quarters net cash usage or of the total principal drawn under the line of credit 
on september   the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
in addition  on september   the company s underwriters exercised their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of the company s common stock at per share 
the combined net proceeds raised from the initial public offering and the exercise of the over allotment option were approximately million 
in may  the company entered into an equipment financing agreement for up to  with a financing company 
the company has financed  in equipment purchases under this agreement structured as loans 
the equipment loans are to be repaid over months at interest rates ranging from to and are secured by the related equipment 
as of june   the outstanding balance under this financing agreement was million 
in june  the company established a line of credit for  with a commercial bank that was fully utilized by august in accordance with the terms of the agreement  the company elected to convert the entire balance to a term loan bearing interest at prime plus due in equal monthly installments 
this line of credit was repaid in full in july in december  the company entered into an equipment financing agreement for up to  with a financing company 
the company had financed  in equipment purchases under this agreement structured as loans 
the equipment loans were repaid over months at interest rates ranging from to and were secured by the related equipment 
this debt was repaid in full in december the company anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents  committed funding from existing corporate collaborations  lines of credit and projected interest income  will enable the company to maintain its current and planned operations at least through december however  the company may require additional funding prior to such time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in its research and development programs  the size and complexity of such programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the ability of the company to establish and maintain corporate collaborations  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical materials and other factors not within the company s control 
the company is seeking additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners and may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing 
the company may not be able to enter into any such agreements  however  or if entered into  any such agreements may not reduce the company s funding requirements 
the company expects that additional equity or debt financing may be required to fund its operations 
additional financing to meet the company s funding requirements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
insufficient funds may require the company to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of its research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than the company would otherwise seek to obtain  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisition of genemedicine research and development programs there are seven primary genemedicine r d programs that the company acquired in march the company s management is primarily responsible for estimating the fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
each of the programs has been valued based on a discounted probable future cash flow analysis using a discount rate of  which management believes adequately reflects the substantial risk of gene therapy research and development 
in the valuation model  it is assumed that for each program preclinical studies and clinical trials are successfully completed  regulatory approval to market the product is obtained  a marketing partner is secured and the company is able to manufacture the product in commercial quantities 
each of these activities is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
the seven primary r d programs that the company acquired are valued as follows in thousands cancer gene medicines il  ifn alpha  il  hemophilia gene medicines factor viii and ix  growth factor gene medicines igf i  pulmonary gene medicines aat gm  vascular growth factor gene medicines vegf  drug controlled geneswitch tm technology  nucleic acid programs apc  cancer gene medicines the company is currently working on three cancer gene medicines with roche including il  ifn a  and il the company recently began a phase ii clinical trial for il in june the company has announced the commencement of phase i ii trials on its ifn alpha and il gene medicines for the treatment of head and neck cancer in march and july  respectively

the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process r d into technologically feasible and commercially viable products principally relate to the successful performance of additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
though the company expects that the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  there can be no assurance that commercial or technical viability of these products will be achieved 
while the expectations and promise of gene therapy are great  clinical efficacy has not yet been demonstrated 
many approaches to gene therapy are being pursued by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  but there are currently no marketed gene therapy products and none are expected for the next several years 
other acquired technology in april  the company acquired rights and intellectual property related to the del gene and protein from progenitor  inc del is a novel extracellular matrix protein involved in early growth and development of blood vessels and bone that has been demonstrated to have potential application in the treatment of certain vascular diseases by stimulating angiogenesis 
the acquisition of del strengthens the company s product development in the area of cardiovascular disease 
the company expensed the cost paid to progenitor for del of  to acquired in process research and development as the technology was not complete at the date of acquisition 
impact of the year a major issue currently faced by all industries is the year yk computer issue 
the problem arises from the use in computer hardware and software of the last two digits rather than four digits to define the year 
as a result  computer programs are unable to distinguish between a year which begins with or 
this  can then cause failures in computer systems and applications  or create erroneous results unless steps are taken to prevent such failures and errors 
the yk problem is also compounded by the fact that many computer and telecommunication systems are interdependent  both within the united states and throughout the world 
thus  due to interdependence  the failure of one system may lead other systems to fail  even if these systems are themselves yk compliant 
in order to address this issue  the company has put a yk plan in place to identify  evaluate and modify its current systems or replace and implement new systems 
identification includes reviewing and assessing the potential systems within the company and at key third party vendors that would be affected by theyk issue 
a yk committee  comprised of members of all the company s departments and senior management  has been established to evaluate  assess and prioritize the company s internal systems and key vendors systems 
in its evaluation stage  the company determined that it would be required to upgrade or replace a portion of its accounting software to a yk compliant version 
the accounting software upgrade was completed in february in addition to the accounting system upgrade  the company has reviewed its key informational  operational and manufacturing systems and has determined the yk issue will not pose significant operational problems for its business activities 
the company has also completed communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own yk issues 
the company has determined that no significant issues exist that would cause it to believe that it cannot continue to use the services of these third parties 
however  if such suppliers or other third parties with which the company transacts business experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to yk non compliance  it could affect the company s ability to process transactions or engage in ordinary business activities 
the company has not used an independent source to verify and validate its year readiness or that of its partners 
additionally  the company has no contingency plans to deal with year failures 
the financial impact of the required upgrades and conversion of computer software relating to the yk issue was funded through operating cash flows and was less than  all costs to date have been expensed as incurred 
however  costs incurred to date  do not take into account the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of yk related failures that occur despite the company s implementation of its yk plan 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  or material issues with respect to the adequacy of third party systems  the company could experience unanticipated material negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in such systems or by the company s failure to adequately prepare for the results of such errors or defects  including the costs of related litigation  if any 
the impact of such consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations
