results of operations revenues in fiscal the company s revenues and earnings were generated primarily from operations of its five business segments credit  dynamark  rmt  insurance and healthcare strategic business units 
the table that follows summarizes the results by segment for years  and the following information should be read in conjunction with note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sales to the consumer credit industry have traditionally accounted for the bulk of the company s revenues 
products developed specifically for a single user in this market are generally sold on a fixed price basis 
such products include application and behavior scoring algorithms also known as analytic products  scorecards or models  credit application processing systems asap tm  creditdesk r and creditcenter tm and custom credit account management systems  including those marketed under the name triad tm 
software systems usually also have a component of ongoing maintenance revenue  and creditdesk systems have also been sold under time or volume based price arrangements 
credit scoring and credit account management services sold through credit bureaus and third party credit card processors are generally priced based on usage 
products sold to the insurance industry are generally priced based on the number of policies in force  subject to contract minimums 
dynamark  rmt and the healthcare unit employ a combination of fixed fee and usage based pricing for their products 
the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of revenues represented by fixed price and usage priced revenues from the credit business unit  and the percentage of revenues contributed by the dynamark  rmt  insurance and healthcare business units  and b the percentage change in revenues within each category from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to credit fixed price usage priced dynamark rmt insurance healthcare total revenues fixed price revenues in the credit business unit include all revenues from custom models  software and consulting projects 
revenues from credit application scoring products decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  and increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in revenues in fiscal reflected the impact of bank consolidations and external market forces relating to year the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the company s sales of new products and increased sales of small business loan scoring products 
asap revenues increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increased sales of pc based asap products creditdesk and sales of the strategyware r decision engine systems 
during the quarter ended september   the company elected to adopt aicpa statement of position no 
sop though adoption by the company was not required for periods prior to october  asap revenues decreased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to the impact of the adoption of sop if sop had not been adopted  asap revenues would have decreased by in fiscal as a result of the early adoption of sop  software revenues of approximately million were deferred in fiscal had the company implemented sop as of october   there would have been approximately million less in asap revenue for the year ended september   which would have been deferred to future periods 
revenues from sales of credit account management systems triad sold to end users increased by from fiscal l to fiscal l and by from fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal and fiscal was due primarily to continuing sales of the then current version of triad triad which was released in november l the company s high degree of success in penetrating the us bankcard industry with these products has limited  and may continue to limit  the revenue growth in that market 
however  the company has added functionality for the existing base of triad users and is actively marketing triad for other types of credit products and in overseas markets 
the company provides credit risk management consulting services primarily through its subsidiary  credit risk management associates  inc crma  the results of which are included in the credit business unit 
crma s revenues increased by in fiscal l compared with fiscal and by in fiscal l compared with fiscal the revenues of crma comprised approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal and in fiscal on october   crma was merged into the company to implement the company s new business strategies 
usage revenues are generated primarily by credit scoring services distributed through major credit bureaus and credit account management services distributed through third party bankcard processors 
in addition  some credit scorecards and software products are licensed under volume based fee arrangements  and these are included in credit usage priced revenues 
revenues from credit bureau related services increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal  and accounted for approximately and of revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from services provided through bankcard processors also increased in each of these years  primarily due to increases in the number of accounts at each of the major processors 
revenues derived from alliances with credit bureaus and credit card processors have accounted for much of the company s revenue growth in the last three years 
while the company has been very successful in extending or renewing such agreements in the past  and believes it will generally be able to do so in the future  the loss of one or more such alliances or an adverse change in terms could have a significant impact on revenues and operating margin 
revenues generated through the company s alliances with equifax  inc  experian information solutions  inc formerly trw information systems services  and trans union corporation each accounted for approximately to of the company s total revenues in fiscal  approximately to in fiscal and approximately to in fiscal on september   amendments to the federal fair credit reporting act became effective 
the company believes these changes to the federal law regulating credit reporting have been favorable to the company and its clients 
among other things  the new law expressly permits the use of credit bureau data to prescreen consumers for offers of credit and insurance and allows affiliated companies to share consumer information with each other subject to certain conditions 
there is also a seven year moratorium on new state legislation on certain issues 
however  the states remain free to regulate the use of credit bureau data in connection with insurance underwriting 
the company believes enacted or proposed state regulation of the insurance industry has had a negative impact on its efforts to sell insurance risk scores through credit reporting agencies 
the financial services modernization act of was enacted and signed into law on november  the statute contains several privacy provisions 
the legislation also allows banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate and enter new business activities 
the company believes that this legislation will not have a material impact on its operations or revenues 
revenues from the company s dynamark business unit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal these increases in dynamark s revenues which exclude intercompany revenues were due primarily to increased revenues from customers in the financial services industry 
since its acquisition  dynamark has taken on an increasing share of the mainframe batch processing requirements of the company s other business units 
such intercompany revenue represented approximately of dynamark s total revenues in fiscal  approximately of dynamark s total revenues in fiscal  and approximately of dynamark s total revenues in fiscal rmt s revenues for fiscal l decreased by compared with fiscal l  and in fiscal decreased by compared with fiscal  due primarily to the impact of bank consolidations and delay in releases of new products 
increases in insurance revenues for fiscal l and  compared with the respective prior year  were due to strong growth in both insurance products sold to end users and in the insurance scoring services offered through consumer reporting agencies 
in fiscal  increases in insurance revenues compared with fiscal were due to growth in insurance scoring services 
the company recorded its first revenues from its healthcare business unit in fiscal in the quarter ended december   the company signed its first revenue generating contract for its receivables management system for hospitals and healthcare providers introduced in december and derived revenues from this new product in fiscal in october the company announced its intent to exit the healthcare receivables management business to devote more resources to other opportunities 
the company is currently exploring its exit options and cannot now forecast the impact of its decision to exit this business 
it is possible that the exit from this business may have an adverse effect on revenues  gross profit and results of operations in the period during which the exit is completed 
the company s revenues derived from clients outside the united states increased from million in fiscal l to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal rmt contributed million  million and million to the company s non us revenues for fiscal years  l and l  respectively 
dynamark has not had significant non us revenues 
sales of software products  including triad and creditdesk  increased usage of credit bureau scores in canada  and an increase in the number of accounts using the company s account management services at credit card processors in europe and latin america accounted for most of the increase in international revenues in fiscal and the decreases in international revenues in fiscal were principally the result of a decline in revenues from sales by rmt in the asian market 
gains or losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not been significant to date but may become more important if  as expected  the proportion of the company s revenues denominated in foreign currencies increases in the future 
revenues from software maintenance and consulting services each accounted for less than of revenues in each of the three years in the period ended september   and the company does not expect revenues from either of these sources to exceed of revenues in the foreseeable future 
during the period since  while the rate of account growth in the us bankcard industry has been slowing and many of the company s largest institutional clients have merged and consolidated  the company has generated most of its revenue growth from its bankcard related scoring and account management business by deepening its penetration of large banks and other credit issuers 
the company believes much of its future growth prospects will rest on its ability to a develop new  high value products  b increase its penetration of established or emerging credit markets outside the us and canada and c expand either directly or through further acquisitions into relatively undeveloped or underdeveloped markets for its products and services  such as direct marketing  insurance  small business lending  healthcare information management  retail  telecommunications and ebusiness 
during fiscal  the company s backlog of orders for fixed priced products declined slightly  and in fiscal this backlog declined an additional million 
this indicates that revenue growth in fiscal and later years may depend to a large extent on sales of newly developed products 
over the long term  in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s rate of revenue growth excluding growth due to acquisitions is limited by the rate at which it can recruit and absorb additional professional staff 
management believes this constraint will continue to exist indefinitely 
on the other hand  despite the high penetration the company has already achieved in certain markets  the opportunities for application of its core competencies are much greater than it can pursue 
thus  the company believes it can continue to grow revenues  within the personnel constraint  for the foreseeable future 
at times management may forego short term revenue growth in order to devote limited resources to opportunities that it believes have exceptional long term potential 
this is the basis for the company s new strategic focus of becoming an ebusiness company and implementing new growth initiatives targeted at the retail and telecommunications markets 
a similar longer range strategic initiative occurred during the period from through  when the company devoted significant resources to developing the usage priced services distributed through credit bureaus and third party processors 
expenses the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated a the percentage of total revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and b the percentage change in the amount of each such line item from the prior fiscal year 
percentage of period to period revenue percentage changes years ended september  to to total revenues costs and expenses cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense nm income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income not meaningful cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel  travel and related overhead costs  costs of computer service bureaus  and the amounts paid by the company to credit bureaus for scores and related information in connection with the scorenet r service 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  declined slightly in the period from fiscal l to fiscal and increased in the period from fiscal l to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to the reassignment to research and development activities of certain personnel whose primary assignment had been production and delivery 
in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increasing percentage of revenues coming from dynamark s products and services which generally have a lower gross margin than the company s other products and services on average 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist principally of personnel  travel  overhead  advertising and other promotional expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses have remained essentially unchanged since fiscal research and development research and development expenses include the personnel and related overhead costs incurred in product development  researching mathematical and statistical algorithms and developing software tools that are aimed at improving productivity  profitability and management control 
research and development  as a percentage of revenues  increased sharply from fiscal l to fiscal and declined slightly from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal and  the company continued to emphasize development of new technologies and new products 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to new bankruptcy scoring products for visa integrated solutions concepts and trans union  new fraud detection software products  joint product development projects with deluxe financial services  inc  healthcare receivables management and year compliance work 
research and development expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to new fraud detection software products  a new release of triad software  year readiness work  development of a new automated strategic application processing system for high end users  next generation credit bureau risk scores and healthcare receivables management 
in the last quarter of fiscal  the company began work on a number of projects for clients in the ebusiness and telecommunications industries 
the decrease in research and development expenses  as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal was due to a reduction in costs of year compliance work and work related to the deluxe development  and the replacement of relatively expensive consultants with regular employees 
the company expects that research and development expenses will increase in future periods for development of new products targeted for the telecommunications and retail markets and to implement its strategic focus on becoming an ebusiness company 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation expenses for certain senior management  corporate facilities expenses  the costs of administering certain benefit plans  legal expenses  expenses associated with the exploration of new business opportunities and the costs of operating administrative functions  such as finance and computer information systems 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged for fiscal l and l and declined in fiscal  due primarily to emphasis on cost reduction measures resulting in slower personnel growth and to reassignment of personnel and related costs 
amortization of intangibles the company is amortizing the intangible assets arising from various acquisitions over periods ranging from four to fifteen years 
during the quarter ended june   the company made the final additional contingent payment to the former shareholders of crma  which was acquired in the amount of the payment was approximately million  resulting in increased amortization expenses in fiscal and in future periods 
see capital resources and liquidity 
other income expense the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents the detail of other income and expenses 
interest income is derived from the investment of funds surplus to the company s immediate operating requirements 
at september   the company had approximately million invested in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments 
interest income increased in both fiscal and due to higher average cash balances in interest bearing accounts and instruments 
the company s share of operating losses in certain early stage development companies that are accounted for using the equity method is charged to other expense 
in the fiscal year ended september   the company liquidated its share of a non marketable security  which had been written off in fiscal as a loss in the amount of million 
this liquidation resulted in a gain of  the company has no further financial commitments in connection with this investment 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s investment in such non marketable securities 
in fiscal  the difference between the increase in operating income and the increase in net income was primarily due to the interest income derived from investments in us treasury securities and other interest bearing instruments  and the absence of losses from investments in start ups 
in fiscal  the company realized a one time gain in the amount of  due to curtailment of the company s pension plan  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also realized a gain of  from the sale of marketable securities 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and in fiscal l  and l  respectively 
the decrease to in fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in the company s effective state tax rate for fiscal capital resources and liquidity working capital increased from  at september  l  to  at september  and to  at september  the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in short term investments  unbilled work in progress and accounts receivable  which more than offset the increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and employee benefits 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  unbilled work in progress and decreases in other accrued liabilities  which more than offset the decreases in short term investments  and accounts receivable and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits 
the company s exposure to collection risks is comprised of the sum of accounts receivable plus unbilled work in progress  less billings in excess of earned revenues 
changes in contract terms and product mix  along with variations in timing  may cause fluctuations in any or all of these items 
during fiscal  the increase in accounts receivable was proportionally much less than the increase in revenues due to improved collection efforts by the company  and the increases in unbilled work in progress and billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional to the increase in revenues 
during fiscal  accounts receivable decreased compared with fiscal due to improved collection efforts 
the increases in billings in excess of earned revenues were proportional to the increase in revenues 
the increase in unbilled work in progress was due primarily to the timing of credit bureau revenues 
the company capitalized  as goodwill relating to amounts due to the former stockholders of crma under the crma purchase agreement  based upon its financial results in fiscal a final additional payment made in june to the former stockholders of crma in the approximate amount of million was capitalized in the third quarter of fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization  and increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increases in accounts receivable  other assets and unbilled work in progress 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment  and purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by the maturities of marketable securities 
cash was provided by financing activities primarily from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by cash used for the payment of dividends and the reduction of capital lease obligations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization  decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accrued compensation and employee benefits  partially offset by the increases in unbilled work in progress and prepaid expenses and other assets and decreases in other accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
cash was used in investing activities primarily for additions to property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and maturities of marketable securities 
cash was provided by financing activities primarily from the exercise of stock options  which was more than offset by cash used for the repurchases of company stock  payment of dividends and the reduction of capital lease obligations 
future cash flows will continue to be affected by operating results  contractual billing terms and collections  investment decisions and dividend payments  if any 
at september   the company had no significant capital commitments other than those obligations described in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the company entered into a synthetic lease arrangement to construct an office complex intended to accommodate future growth  which will materially increase the company s future operating lease expenses 
rental payments will commence upon completion of construction  which is expected to occur in fiscal with this external financing  the company believes that the cash and marketable securities on hand  along with cash expected to be generated by operations  will be adequate to meet its capital and liquidity needs for both the current year and the foreseeable future 
in march  the company initiated a stock repurchase program under which the company was authorized to purchase up to one million shares of its common stock  to be funded by cash on hand 
through september   the company had repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million 
year readiness the company has completed its year remediation work and readiness testing on its software products marketed to customers 
new products and updated versions of its software products currently being shipped to customers are year compliant 
year remediation work  including readiness testing  for most earlier versions of the company s software installed at customer sites is performed as part of the company s normal upgrade and maintenance process 
prior to the end of calendar  the company will discontinue support for some software products that have been replaced by other products  and year upgrades for these products will not be available 
revenues from such products are not significant 
there can be no assurances that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions which may result in material costs to the company 
in addition  the company believes that year issues have caused customers to slow down computer software purchases as they devote more time to preparing and testing their systems for year readiness 
purchasing patterns of customers are expected to be impacted by year issues through january   and beyond 
the company is also aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors arising out of year readiness issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by it 
based on its ongoing assessment of the impact of year issues  the company currently does not expect significant disruption of its revenues or operations from the year issues associated with its products 
this assessment process is continuing and the company has developed contingency plans to address year issues 
as part of the implementation of its contingency plans the company has put in place processes to address expected increases in requests by customers for greater customer support in late and early and has notified customers of this customer support availability 
the company has determined that all of its business critical internal information technology it systems have been thoroughly tested and are year ready 
for all it applications supplied to the company by third parties  appropriate available patches have been applied and the company believes the applications are year ready 
for both it and non it systems  readiness testing is ongoing and will continue through december  with priority given to business critical non it systems and applications 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include a corruption of data contained in the company s internal information systems  and b hardware operating system failure 
the company has completed its contingency plans for business critical it and non it internal systems as an extension of its existing disaster recovery plan 
through september   costs expended for year remediation including readiness testing of products and internal systems and contingency planning are approximately million  and the company currently does not expect such aggregate costs to exceed million 
these costs principally consist of both internal staff costs and expenses for external consultants  software and hardware  which have been or will be expensed by the company during the period they are incurred 
expected costs for the year remediation work including readiness testing and projected completion dates are based on management s estimates and assumptions and actual results may vary materially from those anticipated 
the company is working directly with parties on which it is dependent for essential services and for the distribution of its significant services to address any remaining year issues  including in some cases  jointly developing contingency plans 
information received to date indicates that these parties are in the process of implementing and or testing remediation strategies to ensure year readiness of systems  services and or products 
however  the lack of resolution of year issues by these parties especially the credit bureaus and credit card processors through which the company distributes credit scoring and account management services could have a material adverse impact on the company s future business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios involving third party year issues would include a failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies and third parties eg  transportation  electricity  telephone  internet services  etc 
and b failure of one or more of the credit bureaus or credit card processors through which the company distributes its credit scoring and account management services to achieve timely and successful year readiness 
contingency plans to address these most reasonably likely worst case scenarios have been completed 
at this time the company cannot quantify the potential impact of third party year issues 
the company believes it is taking reasonable steps consistent with standard industry practices to prevent major interruptions in business due to year issues 
its year program is monitored by the audit committee of the board of directors 
the foregoing information and statements regarding the company s year capabilities and readiness are year information and readiness disclosures in conformance with the year information and readiness disclosure act of enacted on october  european economic and monetary union emu under the european union s plan for economic and monetary union emu  the euro becomes the sole accounting currency of emu countries on january  its initial phase went into effect on january   in participating countries austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain 
in this initial phase the emu mandated that key financial systems be able to triangulate conversion rates so that any amount booked will be logged and processed simultaneously in both the local currency and euros 
the company believes that its computer systems and programs are euro compliant 
costs associated with compliance were not material and were expensed by the company as they were incurred 
the company also believes the conversion to the euro will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial results 
quarterly results the table in note to the consolidated financial statements presents unaudited quarterly operating results for the last eight fiscal quarters 
management believes that all the necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated to present fairly the selected quarterly information  when read in conjunction with the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this information includes all normal recurring adjustments that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
quarterly results may be affected by fluctuations in revenue associated with credit card solicitations  by the timing of orders for and deliveries of certain software systems and by the seasonality of scorenet purchases 
with the exception of the cost of scorenet data purchased by the company  most of its operating expenses are not affected by short term fluctuations in revenues  thus  short term fluctuations in revenues may have a significant impact on operating results 
however  in recent years these fluctuations were generally offset by the strong growth in revenues from services delivered through credit bureaus and third party bankcard processors 
during the quarter ended september   the company elected to adopt aicpa statement of position no 
sop though adoption by the company was not required for periods prior to october  as a result of the early adoption of sop  software revenues of approximately million were deferred in fiscal the one time gain due to curtailment of the company s pension plan  described under other income expense  was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes that neither the quarterly variations in net revenues and net income nor the results of operations for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results of operations for full fiscal years 
accordingly  management believes that the company s results should be evaluated on an annual basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures 
the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting mainly of income securities with an average maturity of less than five years 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company believes foreign currency and equity risk is not material
