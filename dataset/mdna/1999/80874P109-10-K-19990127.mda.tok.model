although certain of the features of a lottery  such as the percentage of gross revenues which must be paid back to players in prize money  are usually established by legislation  the lottery authorities generally exercise significant authority  including the determination of the types of games played  the price of each wager  the manner in which the lottery is marketed and the selection of the vendors of equipment and services 
to ensure the integrity of the contract award and wagering process  most jurisdictions require detailed background disclosure on a continuous basis from  and conduct background investigations of  the vendor  its subsidiaries and affiliates and its principal shareholders 
background investigations of the vendor s employees who will be directly responsible for the operation of the system are also generally conducted  and most states reserve the right to require the removal of employees whom they deem to be unsuitable or whose presence they believe may adversely affect the operational security or integrity of the lottery 
certain jurisdictions also require extensive personal and financial disclosure and background checks from persons and entities beneficially owning a specified percentage typically five percent or more of the company s securities 
the failure of such beneficial owners to submit to such background checks and provide such disclosure could result in the imposition of penalties upon such beneficial owners and could jeopardize the award of a lottery contract to the company or provide grounds for termination of an existing lottery contract 
the international jurisdictions in which the company markets its lottery systems also usually have legislation and regulations governing lottery operations 
the regulation of lotteries in these international jurisdictions typically varies from the regulation of lotteries in the united states 
in addition  restrictions are often imposed on foreign corporations seeking to do business in such jurisdictions 
united states and international regulations affecting lotteries are subject to change

pari mutuel operations include the north american and international on track and otb pari mutuel operations  simulcasting services  connecticut otb operations  video gaming and cbs the company s sports wagering service business which was sold in october 
lottery operations include both domestic and international lottery operations including tele control  the company s european lottery business  which was sold in april  as well as systems and equipment sales 
the company is the leading provider of computerized pari mutuel wagering systems to the north american racing industry and is also a leading provider of such systems worldwide 
the company also owns and operates the connecticut otb  is the exclusive licensed operator of pari mutuel wagering in the netherlands and is the leading provider of racing industry simulcasting services in the united states 
additionally  the company provides technologically advanced vgms to the north american racing industry for use at racetracks 
the company also provides lottery systems and equipment in the united states and internationally 
historically  the company s revenues have been derived from two principal sources service revenues and sales revenues 
service revenues are earned pursuant to multi year contracts to provide wagering systems and other services  which are typically based on a percentage of handle and or daily or monthly fees  or are derived from wagering by customers at facilities owned by the company 
sales revenues are derived from sales contracts for wagering equipment  services and software 
the first quarter of the fiscal year and a portion of the second fiscal quarter traditionally comprise the weakest season for wagering service revenue 
wagering equipment sales revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions which do not recur on an annual basis  but which historically have given rise to additional terminal and systems software sales to existing customers 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales 
the company s business strategy over the past several years has been to refocus its activities on its core businesses  which generate recurring revenues rather than one time equipment sales  and to reduce its operating expenses 
consistent with this strategy  the company i in october  sold its casino sports wagering business for approximately million and ii in april  sold its european lottery business for approximately million 
the proceeds from the sales of these businesses were used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness 
the sales of the casino sports wagering business and the european lottery business described above  as well as the acquisitions of simulcasting operations and the french pari mutuel business in fiscal and the acquisitions of the dutch pari mutuel business in fiscal  which were accounted for as purchases  affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  one time equipment sales that can vary significantly from period to period can also significantly affect the comparability of operations from year to year

pari mutuel operations service revenues of million for fiscal improved million or from million in the prior year 
this improvement includes million from the company s netherlands operations  which were acquired in july  and revenue increases of million as a result of growth in handle in the company s north american pari mutuel and connecticut otb operations and the start up of the nasrin tm business in october the growth in handle during fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to the addition of six new north american racetracks and otb sites  full card simulcasting at three north american racetrack customers  the increase in the number of vgm machines  the expansion of otb operations in connecticut to seven days a week in the first quarter of fiscal  and the addition of the new german simulcasting business 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues in the north american simulcasting operations due to lower ad hoc sales of satellite time following the reduction in number and realignment of leased transponders due to the failure of the galaxy iv satellite  and by the loss of a service contract in the company s french operations 
sales revenue  primarily consisting of export sales  were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in the prior year 
lottery operations service revenues decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily because of the sale of the european lottery business in april sales revenues decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the non recurring sale of terminals to the israel lottery in fiscal  partially offset by the sale in fiscal of terminals for use in italy in the sisal sport italia spa lottery operations 
gross profit analysis total gross profits earned by the company  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profits earned by the pari mutuel operations of million in fiscal decreased million from million in fiscal  principally due lower profit on the company s french pari mutuel operations  primarily as a result of the loss of a operations service contract and the resulting costs arising from the termination of employees and the resizing of the business to better serve the reduced french market 
also contributing was the lost profits on sales of excess transponder time as a result of the decrease in leased and available transponders following the failure of the galaxy iv satellite in may these decreases were partially offset by the improved profitability at the north american pari mutuel and otb business units 
gross profits earned by the lottery operations totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal this decline is attributable to a million decline in european lottery gross profits due to the sale of the business unit in april  coupled with lower domestic lottery margins as the result of the installation of the new connecticut lottery terminals and lower margins on equipment sales  reflecting a change in the mix of products sold in each period 
total gross profits on equipment sales were for fiscal  compared to gross profits on such sales of in fiscal the decrease is due to the sale of the european lottery business in  coupled with the lower margins on fiscal equipment sales reflecting the change in mix of products sold in each period 
gross profits on services were approximately for fiscal  or below margins earned in fiscal  reflecting lower margins on the recently acquired business in the netherlands  higher transponder lease costs in simulcasting  lower margins in the european pari mutuel operations as a result of efforts to start up and expand business opportunities  extra costs incurred in connection with the connecticut lottery installation  and start up costs for the nasrin tm business 
expense analysis selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  partially reflecting the absence of expenses for businesses sold in fiscal excluding businesses sold  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased or million as a result of lower bad debt and legal expenses arising from the collection of receivables previously reserved as doubtful due to concerns about their recoverability  and cost savings programs in europe 
partially offsetting these decreases are the added expenses of the recently acquired netherlands operations and the expense of completing the test phase and initial rollout of the nasrin tm communication network 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal approximately million of the decrease is attributable to the absence of expenses related to the businesses sold in fiscal excluding businesses sold  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or as a result of the full amortization of certain intangible assets and lower depreciation on north american pari mutuel assets and lottery assets in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by the accelerated amortization of deferred transponder costs as a result of the galaxy satellite failure and accelerated amortization of goodwill in the french operations resulting from the loss of a major service contract 
due to the large number of service contract renewals in fiscal and the realized durability of the equipment  the company is lengthening the depreciable lives of its pari mutuel terminals from seven to ten years in future reporting periods 
additionally  in fiscal  the company completed the installation of new lottery terminals for the connecticut state lottery under a contract with an initial five year term plus five one year options to extend the contract through may based on industry practice of lottery contracts and the company s historical relationship with the connecticut state lottery for the past ten years  the company expects to depreciate the terminals and installation costs on a straight line method over their estimated useful lives of years 
interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the million increase reflects higher borrowing levels to finance the installation of the new connecticut lottery terminals and higher interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense was million in fisca compared to million in fiscal income tax expense principally reflects foreign tax expense  since no us federal tax benefit has been recognized on domestic operating losses 
the decrease in income tax expense principally reflects the sale of the european lottery business 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue analysis revenues decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in the fiscal year ended october  fiscal 
pari mutuel operations service revenues of million for fiscal improved million or from million in the prior year 
this improvement reflects revenue increases of million as a result of growth in handle in the company s north american pari mutuel and connecticut otb operations  and the addition of new customers in the simulcasting business 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of million in revenue provided in fiscal by the casino sports wagering business which was sold in october and a loss of million in sales of excess transponder time due to the unanticipated shutdown of one of the satellites leased by the company 
the growth in handle during fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to the addition of six new north american racetrack and otb sites  full card simulcasting at three north american racetrack customers  the increase in the number of vgm machines  and the expansion of otb operations in connecticut to seven days a week in the first quarter of fiscal sales revenue in fiscal of million increased million from million in the prior year  due to a million export sale of a totalisator system to the jockey club of peru
