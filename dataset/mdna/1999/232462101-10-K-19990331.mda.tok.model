the following discussion and the section entitled risk factors in item of this annual report on form k describe some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
overview our future operating performance will depend in large part on the rate of growth of electronic commerce  our success at delivering products and services that meet market demands  our ability to maintain and expand our distribution channels  in the case of our new instabuy service  on our ability to form additional alliances with banks and other financial institutions  strategic decisions by major participants in the industry  competitive pricing pressures  legal and regulatory developments  and general economic conditions 
moreover  the market for electronic payment services is still new and changing rapidly 
we are not certain that our product and service offerings will find the widespread market acceptance required to support our level of investment in these offerings 
our revenue expectations have been based partly on expectations of future demand rather than on actual experience 
most of our efforts before were devoted to business development and marketing in preparation for  and anticipation of  the growth in electronic commerce 
largely  as a result of the expenses associated with these efforts  our operating expenses increased each quarter through the end of  but they remained constant at approximately million for the five quarters ended march  we continued our preparations in  making significant investments to expand our technological infrastructure to support the growth of our payment service and instabuy service offerings 
we also increased our marketing and sales expenditures  as we concentrate on expanding our merchant base and deploying the instabuy service 
on april   we completed our acquisition of icverify  inc  a company that develops and markets payment systems software  for  in cash   shares of our common stock valued at on april   the conversion of outstanding vested and unvested stock options under icverify s employee stock option plan into stock options exercisable under the cybercash employee stock option plan for million and transaction costs of approximately  our operating expenses increased to approximately million for the last three quarters of  largely as a result of consolidating icverify s operating results with ours 
we expect to maintain our operating expenses at approximately this level for the foreseeable future 
although our research and development expenses fell slightly in from  we expect research and development expenses will increase slightly as we continue to develop new products  services and enhancements to our existing technology 
during and  we continued our efforts to establish a strong market position and to lay the foundations for growth in recurring revenues as electronic commerce increases 
in  we reduced our reliance on revenues generated by development work performed for strategic allies or joint venture partners 
we do not expect revenues from this kind of development work will be a significant portion of our overall revenue in the future 
electronic commerce appears to have become established  and promises to continue to grow rapidly 
in this environment  our success will depend largely on our ability to continue to compete successfully in our established payments business  establish our agile wallet and the instabuy service  develop our new products and services and market them successfully in a market that is becoming increasingly competitive 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  during  we generated approximately of these revenues from our payments business  from our instabuy program and from international 
in contrast  the majority of our revenues in derived from licensing our internet payment technology and fees for development work associated with these licensing activities 
we grew our revenue stream from our credit payment services by approximately from this growth resulted in part from increasing our base of merchant customers by approximately and in part from implementing a new fee structure  under which we charge merchants a set up and monthly service fee in addition to transaction fees 
of the total revenues from our payments business  approximately derived from set up fees for our payment services and one time perpetual license fees from the sale of our software products 
our revenues from both software sales and payment service set up fees are subject to some seasonal variation 
during the busy year end holiday season  merchants tend to focus their attention on selling  making them reluctant to modify their payment systems 
as a result  sales of payment software and services are slower during that period 
during the last half of  revenues from sales of our software products constituted approximately of our total revenues 
we anticipate that revenues from sales of our payment software will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future even though the market for internet payment services is likely to grow faster than the market for software payment products 
as internet commerce continues to grow  we expect revenues from our payment services to grow also  but the rate of this growth is likely to be slower due to substantial increases in competition in our market 
competitive pressures have both affected our market share and exerted downward pressure on prices for our payment services 
we also expect our sales of payment software to continue to grow  but at a rate more consistent with growth of commerce in the physical brick and mortar world than that of commerce on the internet 
for the foreseeable future  a significant factor in the growth of our revenues will be the success of our agile wallet technology and instabuy service 
we entered into an agreement in october to operate the service for first usa bank  the first financial institution to brand our agile wallet user interface to its specifications and pay us to customize and operate the service for it 
revenues from first usa and other financial institutions for issuing branded agile wallets could be significant in and subsequent years 
however  because the program is new and untested in the marketplace  we cannot predict with any confidence the amount of these revenues  the rate of revenue growth  or whether  in fact  we will succeed in generating revenues from any financial institution other than first usa bank 
the long term success of the instabuy service not only depends on our ability to get other large financial institutions to sponsor and promote the instabuy service but on consumers  internet merchants  portals  online communities and shopping aggregators 
because of the time it will take to enroll significant numbers of merchants  and because of concessionary introductory pricing arrangements  we do not anticipate generating significant revenues from merchants in operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consist primarily of the cost of operations to provide transaction processing  customer service and the software and hardware components for our software products 
cost of revenues increased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of costs incurred to produce and distribute our software products  increasing the size of our customer service and network operations staffs and expanding our technological infrastructure with investments in computers  networking systems and telecommunications equipment to support growing transactions volumes for our service offerings 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expense and consulting fees to support the development of our service and product offerings and technologies 
research and development expenses decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to our ability to shift portions of our us based research and development efforts to our bangalore  india development subsidiary  where the cost of labor is less expensive 
we plan to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
to date  all of our software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we will continue to expense similar costs until we can demonstrate that we may realize future benefits from costs incurred to develop our software 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expense and advertising and marketing costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  a large portion of and sales and marketing expense was related to raising brand awareness of cybercash through television and magazine advertisements 
in addition  during  we almost tripled the size of our direct sales force primarily through the acquisition of icverify 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we promote our instabuy and payment offerings 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for management and support personnel and fees for professional services and other expenses not associated with our general management and administration and not attributable to a particular source of revenue  or type of expense 
general and administrative expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase primarily reflects an increase in employees during as a result of acquiring of icverify and internal growth 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to be significant as we continue to develop and expand our operations 
amortization of intangibles 
we accounted for the acquisition of icverify as a purchase 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition 
of the purchase price  we allocated  to icverify s net assets  and the remainder to intangible assets 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
during  the company had  in amortization expense 
restructuring charges 
we routinely evaluate and realign our organizational structure in order to respond appropriately to the ever changing electronic commerce market space and to take advantage of cost reduction opportunities related to acquisitions 
during and  we recorded restructuring charges of  and  respectively  as a result 
acquisition of netbill technology license 
in  we entered into a technology licensing agreement with carnegie mellon university cmu whereby we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to cmu s netbill technology for use in network based electronic commerce 
due to the uncertainty associated with the realizability of the license acquired  we recorded a non cash charge to operations of  during for the cost of this license 
interest income 
interest income decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  we funded the acquisition of icverify and operating activities out of cash generated from the company s private placements in loss from investments in affiliates 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized losses of  and  respectively  related to our share of the net losses of our affiliates 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  compared to  at december  the decrease of  was a result of a net loss of  which was offset primarily by non cash expenses of  for depreciation  amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  and losses from investments in affiliates and disposal of property and equipment 
in addition  we had cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in affiliates of  capital expenditures of  and investments in other long term assets of  these cash outflows were offset by proceeds from private placements during which resulted in net cash proceeds of  cash provided by the sale of short term investments of  operating activities and the effect of exchange rates of  and cash provided from a receivable from the sale of common stock of  and the sale of cybercash common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options for a total price of  we currently anticipate that our current available cash resources  including the million in private placement funds received in january and an additional million in private placement funds  subject to a firm commitment  combined with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated cash needs  including our working capital requirements for at least twelve to fifteen months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may need to raise additional funds sooner than anticipated in order to fund more rapid expansion  develop new or enhanced services  respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if we do raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or equity securities issued may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of common stockholders 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available now or in the future 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance its services  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results

the common stock we are committed to sell and may sell in the future will increase the amount of our common stock on the public market  which could cause our stock price to decline
