item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nanometrics is a leading manufacturer of thin film measurement systems for the electronics industry 
the company s primary customers are manufacturers of semiconductors  magnetic recording heads and flat panel displays 
nanometrics film measurement systems use wide wavelength range  high sensitivity optics  proprietary computer software and patented technology to measure thickness  uniformity and chemical properties of film deposited on silicon and other substrates 
the primary applications of these systems is to precisely monitor production processes employed in the fabrication of integrated circuits  magnetic recording heads used in disk drives and flat panel displays commonly used in laptop computers 
the company has made several strategic changes in the business over the past several years  which have positioned the company to further participate in these markets 
such changes include i a shift to direct sales from third party representatives in asia  the united kingdom and the united states  ii an increased emphasis on product development  manufacturing and direct sales in japan  iii a decision to outsource certain system components such as robotics  enabling the company to leverage its technical resources  iv the development of new products for the semiconductor  magnetic recording head and flat panel display markets including products that can be used for mm wafers and chemical mechanical polishing  and v the acquisition of the overlay registration product line see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these changes have contributed to revenue growth from million in to million in as a result of the current semiconductor industry downturn  revenues in the second half of decreased approximately from the first half of the year resulting in an overall decline for the year of compared to the company s business is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of i semiconductors  ii magnetic recording heads for the read write function on disk drives  and iii flat panel displays 
the demand by such manufacturers is  in turn  dependent on the current and future market demand for i semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors  ii disk drives and computers that utilize disk drives  and iii flat panel displays for use in laptop computers  pagers  cell phones  and a variety of other applications where portability and low power consumption are important 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors  magnetic recording heads  and flat panel displays is also an important factor in the demand for the company s thin film measurement products 
the company believes that its diversification through multiple industry applications of its technology increases the total available market for its products and reduces  to an extent  its exposure to the cyclicality of any individual industry segment 
for example  in fiscal  a decline in sales to manufacturers of semiconductors was offset by increased sales to manufacturers of magnetic recording heads and flat panel displays 
however  the prolonged economic downturn in asia has affected the company s markets and has contributed to the current semiconductor slowdown which has had an adverse impact on the company s operations 
a high degree of uncertainty exists regarding the length and severity of the current industry downturn 
for this and other reasons  the company s results of operations for are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
the company derives its revenues from product sales and service  which includes sales of accessories and service to the installed base of products 
in  the company derived of its total net revenues from product sales and of its total net revenues from services 
revenues from product sales and replacement and spare parts are recognized at the time of shipment 
ii revenues from service work are recognized when performed 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
as a result  a small change in the number of systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in revenues in any particular quarter 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve the company s revenue objective for that quarter 
moreover  all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with minimal penalties 
consequently  the company depends on shipping products in the same quarter that the purchase order is received 
the failure of the company to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments may cause quarterly net revenues to fall significantly short of the company s objectives  which would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will grow in future periods or that it will sustain its level of net revenues or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company may  in some future quarter  have operating results that will be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would be materially adversely affected 
see factors that may affect future operating results significant fluctuations in operating results 
results of operations total net revenues 
total net revenues decreased from million in to million in product sales decreased by from million in to million in the decrease in product sales resulted from slower worldwide demand for and decreased shipments of the company s products  especially in the us and in the far east 
service revenue decreased from million in to million in the decrease in service revenue is primarily attributable to lower sales of parts  services and accessories in asia and the us in due in part to increased functionality and reliability of the company s newer products 
total net revenues increased from million in to million in product sales increased by from million in to million in the increase in product sales resulted from stronger worldwide demand for and increased shipments of the company s products  especially its automated products 
service revenue decreased from million in to million in the decrease in service revenue is primarily attributable to lower sales of parts  services and accessories in asia and the us in due in part to increased functionality and reliability of the company s new products

in the first quarter of  the company paid approximately million for the assets and technology related to the metra product line from optical specialties inc of this purchase price   related to the value of in process research and development that had no alternative future use and was charged to expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  the company s increase in research and development expenses discussed above is primarily attributable to efforts to bring the acquired in process technology to completion 
selling 
selling expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily because of lower commission expenses and other expenses associated with lower sales levels in selling expenses increased from million in to million in primarily because of higher commission expenses resulting from higher sales levels  the addition of sales and marketing staff and the opening of an office in scotland in during selling expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to and in and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in remained essentially unchanged from at million 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in as a result of higher spending associated with the increase in total net revenues 
during general and administrative expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to and in and  respectively 
total other income  net 
total other income  net increased from  in to  in primarily due to lower exchange rate losses in total other income  net decreased from  in to  in primarily due to higher royalty income and exchange rate gains in the prior year 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in to in primarily as a result of income tax benefits realized from net operating losses in foreign tax jurisdictions 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in to in primarily due to an increased benefit from the company s foreign sales corporation 
the effective income tax rates in  and exceed the us statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes partially offset by realization of foreign sales corporation benefit

the company has evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to the company s business 
these activities may result in product and business investments 
for example  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in march  the company purchased from optical specialties  inc a metrology system product line and related assets 
under the agreement  the company paid approximately million in cash for the assets and technology 
the company funded this acquisition from its cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations

the accompanying information contained in this report including without limitation  the information set forth below under factors that may affect future operating results  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business  identify important factors that could cause such differences 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking statements made in this report to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
factors that may affect future operating results the following risk factors should be considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company in evaluating the company  its business  financial condition and business prospects 
significant fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
the company anticipates that the factors that may affect its future operating results include the following customer demand for the company s products  which is affected by factors including the cyclicality of the semiconductor  magnetic recording head and flat panel display industries served by the company  patterns of capital spending by customers  technological changes in the markets served by the company and its customers  market acceptance of products of both the company and its customers  the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  competition  including competitive pressures on product prices and changes in pricing by the company s customers or suppliers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the japanese yen  the proportion of direct sales versus sales through distributors and representatives  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  the timing of new product announcements and releases of products by the company or its competitors  including the company s ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a timely and cost effective basis  the size and timing of acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies and fluctuations in the availability and cost of components and subassemblies 
gross margins may vary materially from quarter to quarter or year to year  based on a number of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of products sold and the absorption of fixed operating costs 
the impact of the factors listed above and other factors on the company s revenues  financial condition and operating results in any future period cannot be forecasted with any degree of certainty 
based upon these factors  the company believes that its quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will grow in future periods or that it will sustain its level of revenues or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results could be below the expectations of stock market analysts and ii investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on limited number of systems sales  backlog 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
as a result  a small change in the number of systems actually shipped may cause significant changes in revenues in any particular quarter 
customer purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customers with minimal penalties 
moreover  the company s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve the company s revenue objective for that quarter 
consequently  the company depends to an extent on shipping products in the same quarter that the purchase order is received 
the failure of the company to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments may cause quarterly net revenues to fall significantly short of the company s objectives  which would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
cyclicality of customer industries 
the company s business depends in large part upon the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
in addition  the company s business depends upon the construction of new semiconductor fabrication facilities and improvements to existing fabrication facilities to reduce unit costs or to respond to technological innovation 
the semiconductor industry has been cyclical in nature and historically has experienced periodic downturns 
such downturns are characterized by diminished product demand  erosion of average selling prices and production over capacity 
during downturns  manufacturers typically defer or cancel orders for equipment to conserve cash and reduce expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected by future downturns in the semiconductor industry 
in the past  the company has offset declines in orders of its products from the semiconductor industry with increased sales to manufacturers of magnetic recording heads and flat panel displays  however  the company has not been able to do so in the current semiconductor downturn 
in addition  the magnetic recording head and flat panel display industries are subject to similar cyclical conditions that could materially affect the market for the company s products and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may also experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to such industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy 
even during periods of reduced revenues  in order to remain competitive the company will be required to continue to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capability  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business financial condition and results of operations during industry downturns or other periods of reduced revenues 
lengthy sales cycle  difficulties in displacing entrenched competitors 
sales of the company s systems depend  in significant part  upon the decision of prospective customers to increase their existing production capacity by building and equipping new fabrication facilities or expanding existing facilities  either of which typically involves a significant capital commitment 
in view of the significant investment involved in a system purchase  the company may experience delays in obtaining purchase orders while the customer plans for such expansion  evaluates various thin film measurement systems of the company and its competitors and receive purchase approvals 
due to these and other factors  the company s systems typically have lengthy sales cycles during which the company may expend substantial funds and management effort 
in addition  lengthy sales cycles subject the company to a number of significant risks  including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results over which the company has little or no control 
customers often evaluate several suppliers systems before deciding on the type of thin film measurement system to use 
the company believes that the customer generally relies upon that system for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other thin film measurement system requirements with the same supplier 
accordingly  the company expects to experience ii difficulty in selling to a particular customer for a significant period of time if that customer already uses a competitor s thin film measurement system 
highly competitive industry 
the market for thin film measurement systems is subject to intense competitive pressure and characterized by rapidly evolving technology 
the company competes on a global basis with both larger and smaller companies in the united states  japan and europe 
the company competes primarily with thin film measurement products from kla tencor corporation  therma wave inc  rudolph technologies  dai nippon screen  toray industries  nova measuring instruments  and on line technologies  as well as overlay metrology products from kla tencor  biorad laboratories  and schlumberger 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
for example  the company expects to face increased competition in the emerging market for mm thin film measurement systems 
new product introductions and enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s systems 
there can be no assurance that company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
increased competitive pressure could lead to reduced demand and lower prices for the company s products  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations  recent economic trends in asia 
international revenues accounted for approximately of the company s total net revenues for the company anticipates that international revenues will continue to account for a substantial portion of its total net revenues in the foreseeable future 
the company s international operations are subject to risks inherent in the conduct of international business  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  import or export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in collecting payments due from sales agents or customers  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
furthermore  downturns in foreign capital markets could affect the company s international customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent economic trends  particularly in the asia pacific marketplace  have caused a heightened awareness of the impact of this portion of the world s economy can have on the overall economy 
as the asia pacific market currently represents a significant portion of the world s buying power  and approximately of the company s sales are to this region  changes in this area s economic growth rate may impact suppliers of product in that market  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the future performance of the company will be dependent  in part  upon its ability to continue to compete successfully in asia  one of the largest markets for the company s products 
the company s ability to compete in this area in the future is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between the region especially japan  korea and taiwan and the united states and the continuing ability of the company to maintain satisfactory relationships with customers and potential customers in the region 
in addition  the japanese market  which is important to the company s sales  has historically been difficult for non japanese companies to penetrate 
although the company has had a direct presence in japan since  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or improve its competitive position in japan 
approximately of the company s total net revenues for were generated by the company s japanese subsidiary and are denominated in japanese yen 
a significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between the yen and the us dollar could result in a significant gain or loss being recorded in the company s consolidated statement of income 
a decline in the exchange rate of the ii yen against the us dollar would result in a decrease in consolidated total net revenues and consolidated net income  whereas an increase in the exchange rate of the yen against the u 
s 
dollar would result in an increase in consolidated total net revenues and consolidated net income 
generally  a change in the exchange rate would have a similar impact on the consolidated net income associated with accounts due between the us parent and the japanese subsidiary 
the company s international revenues in countries except japan are denominated in us dollars and sales to customers may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates which could increase the sales price in local currencies of the company s products 
since the company does not currently engage in currency exchange rate hedging transactions  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the future will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the film measurement industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
the company believes that a key factor in its growth in the past four years has been the success of new product introductions  including the model and model introduced in a key factor in the company s ability to achieve continued growth will be the market success of recent new product introductions  including products for mm wafers  overlay registration and integrated thin film measurements 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to respond to technological change and develop new and enhanced systems and to introduce these systems at competitive prices and in a timely and cost effective manner 
new product introductions may contribute to fluctuations in quarterly operating results  since customers may defer ordering product from the company s existing product line in anticipation of the introduction of the new product or product enhancement 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements of existing products by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
the success of the company in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including product selections  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing and product performance 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs and additional service and warranty expenses may result 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
if the company does not successfully introduce new products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
uncertainty of intellectual property rights 
the company s future success and competitive position depends in large part on the company s ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary technology used in its systems 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the extent as do the laws of the united states 
the validity of the company s patents has not been adjudicated by any court 
competitors may bring legal challenges to the validity of one or more of these patents  or attempt to circumvent the patents 
there can be no assurance that company s patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology  or that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide meaningful competitive advantages to the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not ii independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products  or if patents are issued to the company  design around such patents 
the company does not believe that its products infringe any patents or proprietary rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that such infringements do not exist or will not occur in the future 
as is typical in the high technology industry  the company has from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications alleging possible infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
the company investigates all such notices and responds as appropriate 
some customers of the company have received notices of infringement from the lemelson medical  education  research foundation  a limited partnership  alleging that equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductor products infringes their patents 
a number of these customers have notified the company that they may seek indemnification from the company for any damages and expenses resulting from this matter 
certain of the company s customers have engaged in litigation with the late mr 
lemelson involving a number of his patents and some of these cases have been settled 
although the ultimate outcome of these matters is not presently determinable  there can be no assurance that the resolution of all such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
based on industry practice  the company believes that in most cases it could obtain any necessary licenses or other rights on commercially reasonable terms  but no assurance can be given that licenses would be available or would be on acceptable terms  that litigation would not ensue or that damages for any past infringement would not be assessed 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets of know how owned by the company  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the right of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of effort by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  adverse determination in such litigation could result in the company s loss of proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of infringement claims could have adverse material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sole or limited sources of supply  reliance on subcontractors  complexity in manufacturing processes 
the company is relying increasingly on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of the company s systems are obtained from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers 
for example  the company relies on kensington laboratories for the robotics incorporated in the company s automated systems 
the company does not maintain any long term supply agreements with kensington laboratories or any of its suppliers 
the company has entered into an agreement with ja woollam company for the spectroscopic ellipsometer component incorporated in the company s advanced measurement systems 
the company s reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  reduced control of pricing and timely delivery of components and subassemblies and suppliers potential inability to develop technologically advanced products to support the company s growth and development of new systems 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves extremely complex process and requires long lead times  there can be no assurance that delays or shortages caused by suppliers will not occur in the future 
the company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified  if necessary  for most sole and limited source parts 
however  if the company were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  it may be required to redesign its systems  which could prevent the company from shipping its systems to its customers on a timely basis 
certain of the company s suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
any inability to obtain adequate ii deliveries or any other circumstance that would restrict the company s ability to ship its products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
information systems and the year many computer systems are expected to experience problems handling dates around the year yk 
the yk issue is the result of many currently installed computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  these computer programs are unable to distinguish between st century dates and th century dates and could cause computer system failures or miscalculations that result in significant business disruptions 
described below are the actions the company has taken  and plans to take  to address the potential problems resulting as systems attempt to handle dates around the millennium 
state of readiness the company s upper management has discussed and agreed upon a comprehensive plan to address its yk issues 
the yk plan includes the following activities gathering data and taking inventory  testing systems and products to evaluate yk compliance  execution of remediation activities to fix non compliant products and systems  and monitoring and testing products and systems on an ongoing basis 
the major business areas impacted are products many of the company s products incorporate computer software to control certain add on features and functionality 
the company s products are measurement tools and yk issues arise in the company s products where database functions are used eg storage of measurement data 
the company has completed testing and evaluation of its products for yk compliance 
as a result of such evaluation  the company believes that i most of its current product lines are yk compliant  ii upgrades are currently available or will be available by mid for non yk compliant automated products  and iii as database functionality is not used in certain older obsolete products and in non automated systems  yk compliance is not believed to be an issue 
procurement critical suppliers have been contacted and status of products and internal systems has been verified 
the company is in the process of evaluating the balance of its supplier base 
this evaluation is expected to be completed by may  manufacturing the company s assembly and test equipment is scheduled for ongoing upgrades to yk compliant configurations through mid the company s primary manufacturing application software system is scheduled to be upgraded to be yk compliant by mid the cost of such upgrade is included in the estimate of the costs to upgrade the information technology as discussed below 
information technology systems it the company has conducted a survey of its it hardware and software and has identified substantially all non yk compliant hardware and software 
the company has purchased a yk upgrade license from its it vendor and expects to implement the upgrade by mid the company currently estimates the cost of the upgrade license and the related internal and external costs to implement will approximate facilities and infrastructure an assessment of the yk readiness of owned and leased assets has been performed and systems which will require upgrade or replacement include the security and card key system and the voicemail system 
costs while the company has not yet completed the entire evaluation of the required activities to address the yk issues  the company currently believes that the estimated costs of yk compliance efforts are not expected to be material to the company 
ii risks the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case yk scenarios include the following customers could change their buying patterns in a number of ways  including accelerating or delaying purchases of  or replacement of  the company s products and services 
the company could experience a disruption in service to its customers as a result of the failure of third party products  including the following third party products which are non compliant and are incorporated into the company s products could cause the products to fail  a breakdown in telephone  e mail  voicemail  could impact the responsiveness of the company s customer service department  yk problems at a number of the company s suppliers including banks  telephone companies and the united states postal service could have a pervasive impact on the company s business as a whole  and product features that rely on date parameters generally date dependent routings and operating reports could malfunction 
although the company s products are undergoing both yk specific  and its normal testing procedures  its products may not contain all of the necessary date code or other changes to operate in the year any failure of such products to perform could result in claims and lawsuits against the company  significantly impaired customer satisfaction resulting in customers withholding cash owed to the company and delaying or canceling orders  and managerial and technical resources being diverted away from product development and other business activities 
any of the above stated consequences  in addition to others which the company cannot yet foresee  could have a significant adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
contingency plan the company currently believes that its plan is adequate to address its yk issues  and accordingly  does not believe that it is practical to develop a comprehensive contingency plan 
based on the current plan s timeline  the company believes that it would be able to determine the effectiveness of the current plan by mid as such  in the event that its current plan is not adequate to address the yk issues  the company believes that there will be adequate time to establish and implement a contingency plan 
once a contingency plan is implemented  however  the company cannot be certain that such a plan would prevent significant yk problems from having a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence upon key employees 
because of the specialized nature of the company s business  the company s future performance depends upon the continued service of members of the company s senior management and other key research and development and sales and marketing personnel 
the loss of any of such persons could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not have employment contracts with any of its employees in the united states 
the company believes that its future success will depend upon it continuing ability to identify  attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  technical  sales and marketing personnel in key areas worldwide 
hiring for such personnel is highly competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract  assimilate and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the failure to recruit additional key personnel in a timely manner  or the failure to retain new or current personnel  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ii impact of industry consolidation 
the company believes that the thin film measurement system market is undergoing a period of consolidation  which could impact the company s future success 
a number of suppliers have been acquired by larger equipment manufacturers 
for example  in kla corporation acquired a competitor of the company  tencor corporation  to form kla tencor corporation
