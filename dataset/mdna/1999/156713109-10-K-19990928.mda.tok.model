item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook the company reported net loss of  per share on sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  in the previous fiscal year  the company reported net earnings of  per share on sales of million 
in fiscal year  the company reported a consolidated loss from continuing operations of  
per share on sales of million  but extraordinarily positive overall net earnings of  per share 
the results in fiscal year included earnings from the operations of  and a gain from the redemption of its interest in  capitol office solutions  the company s discontinued copy machine products and services segment 
the company attributed its unfavorable results for the fiscal year ended june  to the unfavorable results of insituform east  the company s majority controlled subsidiary and only remaining operating segment 
insituform east recognized a consolidated net loss of  on sales of million  contributing a loss of  to cerbco in fiscal year insituform east attributed its unfavorable results in fiscal year to the acceptance by midsouth partners  its majority controlled subsidiary partnership  of additional job completion costs on several incomplete projects  costs incurred in connection with litigation initiated by insituform technologies  inc against insituform east and midsouth partners  and an increase in discounted sales performed by insituform east and its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  east 
the company attributed its positive net earnings for the fiscal year ended june  primarily to the parent company s short term investment earnings 
insituform east recognized a consolidated net loss of  on sales of million  contributing a loss of  to cerbco  in fiscal year the operations of east produced positive operating results in fiscal year due to the favorable impact of the perry nuclear project in the first quarter of the fiscal year  which more than offset the impact of reduced sales volume during the rest of the year 
however  midsouth partners experienced significantly reduced margins throughout the year  producing contributory losses that more than offset east s modestly favorable results 
insituform east recognized a consolidated net loss of  on sales of million  contributing a loss of  to cerbco  in fiscal year with respect to forward looking information  while there can be no assurances regarding the company s future operating performance  based on the volume and mix of insituform east s present and expected workable backlog of customer orders and the curtailment of further legal costs as a result of the midsouth settlement agreement effective july   the company presently anticipates modest but positive operating results for insituform east for the first quarter of fiscal year a combination of additional sales at normal margins and increased production levels will be required to sustain positive operating results for insituform east for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year 
income from the company s non operating activities presently is anticipated to approximate the normal levels of its holding company expenses into the future  accordingly  absent unusual items  the company s future results are anticipated substantially to parallel the company s approximate participation in the future results of insituform east 
the principal factor affecting the company s future performance remains the volatility of insituform east s earnings as a function of sales volume at normal margins 
accordingly  because a substantial portion of insituform east s costs are semi fixed in nature  earnings can  at times  be severely reduced or eliminated during periods of depressed sales at normal margins or material increases in discounted sales  even where total revenues may experience an apparent buoyancy or growth from the addition of discounted sales undertaken from time to time for strategic reasons 
conversely  at normal margins  increases in period sales typically leverage positive earnings significantly 
the company believes the trenchless pipeline reconstruction marketplace is continuing to expand  thereby enticing  however  the entry of ever more contractors with limited cured in place pipe cipp installation experience or inferior imitation products hoping that cheap price alone might permit them to succeed against insituform east s quality and time tested cipp rehabilitation capability 
in that segment of the market where technical risk and the lowest priced product may be deemed good enough  the company is at a disadvantage and market share participation strategically undertaken by the company in such segment  at levels materially below normal margins  necessarily dilutes the company s overall margin performance 
conversely  in the best value and quality based market segment  the company s quality cipp rehabilitation capability continues to provide a distinct advantage 
while both the federal government and industry routinely use best value and quality weighted contract award criteria in technical procurements  municipalities and local governments are often politically reluctant to modernize from simply low bid buying to best value buying 
in the face of mounting technical failures from awards based upon lowest price  municipalities are also expected over time to reevaluate traditional low bid award criteria in favor of best value award criteria when procuring trenchless technology for the rehabilitation of older pipelines

east s sales decreased in fiscal year  midsouth partners sales decreased 
consolidated operating results decreased million from an operating loss of million in to an operating loss of million in insituform east s gross profit margin decreased from to due primarily to reduced margins on work performed by midsouth partners more than offsetting improved margins recognized by east 
improved east margins in were due in part to completion of the perry nuclear project and a mix of work that included a reduced volume of discounted work and work subcontracted to others 
reduced margins for midsouth partners were due primarily to both discounted sales and performance inefficiencies 
insituform east s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of reduced legal expenses and lower costs to support reduced production activities 
additional legal costs were incurred during fiscal year in connection with the inliner usa cat contracting antitrust lawsuit 
the parent company s unallocated general corporate expenses were down slightly from the previous year  as decreased legal expenses were largely offset by increased salary expense 
investment income increased million as a result of interest earned on short term investment of cash realized from the sale of the company s interest in capitol office solutions on june  other income increased million primarily as a result of the payment of damages to cerbco in connection with the delaware action 
earnings from discontinued operations in fiscal year resulted from the then operations of capitol office solutions

the company s operating activities used approximately million and million in cash in fiscal years and  respectively  and provided approximately million in cash during fiscal year net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the primary use of such funds was for capital expenditures by insituform east in each of the fiscal years to upgrade  expand and improve production capabilities  and purchases of vehicles and production equipment to replace aging units

cerbco believes that insituform east s cash flow from future operations  existing working capital and borrowing potential against unencumbered assets will be sufficient to finance the cash requirements of future capital expenditures 
the parent holding company  cerbco  has cash and temporary investments in excess of million which  pending longer term investment  it believes are more than adequate to meet its own cash flow requirements and the temporary requirements of insituform east in the foreseeable future 
as previously disclosed  the company may purchase additional shares of common stock of insituform east 
the company expects that any such purchases would be made in open market transactions  at the then prevailing market price  and executed through brokers 
any such purchases will require use of the company s working capital 
year issues the inability of present computerized systems to process dates correctly beyond december  and the potential impact on businesses and governments in the future are generally referred to as year issues 
the company has implemented plans to address year issues 
primary areas of focus include the company s information technology systems  the company s non information technology systems  the year readiness of the company s vendors and suppliers and the year readiness of the company s major customers 
because the company s primary products and services neither include nor rely upon computerized components  the company believes that there are no additional contingencies associated with actual or implied warranties related to its products and services resulting from year issues 
with respect to the company s information technology systems  the company s primary accounting and information process system is year ready and will recognize years through in the proper century 
the company s preliminary assessment of supporting information systems is that these systems either are year ready  can be modified to become year ready  or would not have a significant impact on either the primary accounting and information system or the company s operating activities should non compliant systems not be properly modified 
vendor supplied modifications for supporting information systems were implemented and tested prior to june   and are believed to be year ready 
with respect to the company s non information technology systems  the company is dependent on information from vendors and suppliers in assessing and evaluating these systems 
as potential year issues were identified during the preliminary assessment stage  implementation plans were developed and executed 
the company initiated and completed corrective action for its office telephone system and headquarters facility security system  two systems that were identified as not being year ready 
with respect to the company s suppliers and customers  the company has initiated preliminary correspondence with selected critical suppliers and customers 
responses received to date indicate that responding suppliers and customers either are currently year ready or expect to be year ready by december  the company will continue to seek to obtain responses from suppliers and customers who have not as yet responded to inquiries and is monitoring year readiness from respondents not as yet year ready 
the company currently estimates that the cost of implementing its year plan will not exceed  this estimate is based on presently available information and may require future reassessment 
specifically  this estimate would change if  after receipt of information from key suppliers or customers  a modified contingency plan required development and implementation 
the company has incurred  in implementation costs through june  there can be no assurances that the company s year plan will be successful 
the company is dependent on vendors to identify and correct year issues related to the company s utilities and equipment using computerized components 
in addition  if key vendors fail to provide materials critical to the company s operations  or with sufficient electrical power or other utilities  or if transportation of the company s personnel and equipment is seriously impeded  then any such failure or impedance could have a material adverse effect on the operational performance and financial condition of the company 
in addition  if major municipal  industrial or federal government customers are seriously affected  directly or indirectly  by year issues such that pipeline rehabilitation programs are delayed or abandoned  this too could have a material adverse effect on the operational performance and financial condition of the company 
the company established a contingency plan  effective june   based primarily on potential actions that would be required if key vendors or customers are unable to address and resolve year issues that would directly or indirectly impact the company s ability to conduct normal business operations in the year and beyond 
specifically  the company has identified potential alternate vendors for critical installation materials  tube and resin  in case primary tube and resin suppliers fail to provide materials critical to the company s operations 
in addition  the company intends to rely on the geographic separation of its operations facilities and reallocate resources as necessary should vendors fail to supply sufficient electrical power or other utilities to an operations facility  or if transportation of the company s personnel and equipment is seriously impeded in a particular geographic area
