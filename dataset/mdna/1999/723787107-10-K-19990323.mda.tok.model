item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations formation of pioneer pioneer natural resources company pioneer  or the company  a delaware corporation  was formed by the merger of parker parsley petroleum company parker parsley and mesa inc mesa on august  on december   the company was significantly expanded by the acquisition of the canadian and argentine oil and gas business of chauvco resources ltd 
chauvco  a publicly traded  independent oil and gas company based in calgary  canada 
pioneer is an oil and gas exploration and production company with ownership interests in oil and gas properties located in the united states  argentina  canada and south africa 
the combined physical assets and management resources of parker parsley  mesa and chauvco have created a company with a solid foundation of complementary assets and industry expertise 
this foundation is anchored by the hugoton gas field located in southwest kansas  the west panhandle gas field located in the texas panhandle  and the spraberry oil and gas field in west texas 
each of these fields provides consistent and dependable production  cash flow and ongoing development opportunities 
these three areas are complemented by the exploration and development opportunities and oil and gas production contributed by pioneer s assets in the united states gulf coast area  argentina and canada 
these assets create a portfolio of resources and opportunities that are well balanced between oil  natural gas liquids and gas  and  that are balanced between long lived  dependable production and exploration and development opportunities 
along with these assets  the company has a team of dedicated employees that represent the professional disciplines and sciences that will allow pioneer to maximize the long term profitability and net asset values inherent in its physical assets 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations  both the merger with mesa and the acquisition of chauvco have been accounted for as purchases by the company formerly parker parsley 
as a result  the historical financial statements of the company are those of parker parsley prior to august  and present the addition of mesa s and chauvco s assets and liabilities as acquisitions by the company in august and december  respectively 
financial performance the company reported a net loss of million per share for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million per share and net income of million per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the results were significantly impacted by declining commodity prices  a full year of production volumes from the assets acquired from mesa and chauvco  provisions for the impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties  increased interest and general and administrative expenses  reorganization initiatives and a valuation allowance recognized to reduce the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets 
crude oil and natural gas prices have declined substantially since the average prices realized by the company in  including the effects of oil and gas hedges  were per bbl of oil  per bbl of ngl and per mcf of gas  as compared to average realized prices for oil  ngls and gas of per bbl  per bbl and per mcf  respectively  in  and  average realized prices for oil and gas of per bbl and per mcf  respectively  in the effects of the declining prices on the company s results of operations and net cash generated by operating activities have been mitigated by strategic oil and gas price hedges and increased production volumes 
primarily as a result of the additions of the mesa and chauvco oil and gas properties  oil  ngl and gas production increased to  mboe as compared to total production of  mboe and  mboe in and  respectively 
oil and gas production costs and depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increased to million and million  respectively  in  primarily as a result of increased production volumes 
oil and gas production costs and depletion  depreciation and amortization expense were million and million  respectively  in and and million  respectively  in the declining commodity price outlooks and performance issues prompted the company to review its oil and gas properties for impairment in and  resulting in non cash  pre tax impairment provisions of million and billion in and  respectively 
exploration and abandonments expense for was million as compared to million and million in and  respectively  reflecting continued expansion of the company s exploration program into interest and general and administrative expenses were million and million in  respectively  as compared to respective expenses of million and million in and million and million in the increase in interest expense is primarily reflective of a full year of interest expense incurred on the debt that was assumed in the mesa and chauvco acquisitions and increases in debt during to fund a portion of the company s capital expenditures 
the increase in general and administrative expenses similarly reflects a full year of corporate overhead and other costs incurred to manage a larger corporate entity 
during  the company implemented cost containment initiatives intended to increase future operational and administrative efficiencies 
those initiatives included the closings of the company s regional offices in oklahoma city  oklahoma  corpus christi  texas  and houston  texas  the elimination of approximately employee positions and other initiatives 
the million reorganization charge recognized during is a result of these initiatives 
other expenses increased to million in  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
other expense for included  and increased primarily as a result of  million of mark to market adjustments of non hedge foreign currency and btu swap agreements previously owned by chauvco and mesa  a million write off of deferred compensation arising from change of control features in the company s incentive plans  million of other expenses associated with the company s operations in argentina and canada  and  million of bad debt expense 
the net loss for was also impacted by a million valuation allowance recognized to reduce the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets 
this charge  which significantly impacted the company s net loss  is a non cash component of operating results and did not impact the company s net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  and to million for the year ended december  the additional cash flow generated by the increased production realized from the acquired mesa and chauvco properties was partially offset by the aforementioned declining commodity prices and increased costs and expenses 
total debt has increased to billion at december  from billion at december   due principally to capital expenditures in exceeding cash flow provided by operating activities 
the company strives to maintain its outstanding indebtedness at a moderate level in order to provide sufficient financial flexibility for future opportunities 
the company s total book capitalization at december  was billion  consisting of total debt of billion and stockholders equity of 
billion 
as a result of increases in debt and reductions in shareholders equity primarily resulting from and non cash impairment provisions see note m and note o of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  the company s debt to total capitalization increased to percent at december  from percent at december  see results of operations  below  for more in depth discussions of the company s oil and gas producing activities  including discussions pertaining to oil and gas production volumes  prices  hedging activities  costs and expenses  capital commitments  capital resources and liquidity 
outlook the company s results of operations and financial condition in are expected to be significantly affected by industry wide conditions and company specific attributes and plans 
the declining trend in commodity prices has resulted from a combination of factors which have contributed to increased oil and gas supplies and decreased demand for those commodities 
the most significant of those factors include increased crude oil exports by iraq and other members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  mild weather patterns in heavy energy consuming areas during and  and declining demand for energy in the asian and other formerly high growth areas of the world due to regional recessions 
during  the company anticipates a continuation of the unfavorable commodity price environment presently impacting the oil and gas industry 
in response thereto  pioneer plans to take deliberate actions to reduce its outstanding indebtedness and to protect its operating cash flows 
the specific initiatives being taken include reductions in capital expenditures  the divestment of non strategic assets  the continuation of cost containment measures and the maintenance of hedge positions designed to reduce the volatility of realized natural gas prices 
capital expenditures 
during  the company plans to reduce capital expended for oil and gas property additions to approximately million  of which million has been budgeted for exploration expenditures and million has been budgeted for exploitation projects 
geographically  during the company expects capital expenditures of million in the united states  million in argentina and million in canada 
pioneer s long lived reserves and dependable production in the hugoton and west panhandle gas fields and spraberry oil field allow it the flexibility necessary to make significant changes in its capital allocation plans without significantly impacting near term production volumes 
during  pioneer s exploration and exploitation programs will focus on natural gas projects 
the company s exploitation program will focus on gas development in the gulf coast area and west panhandle field in the united states  the chinchaga field in canada  and in the neuquen basin in argentina 
exploration drilling will be concentrated in the gulf of mexico and the onshore gulf coast area 
the company will participate in one or two wells in the gulf of mexico deep water mississippi canyon block the first well was spudded in january and is scheduled for preliminary evaluations in march 
two additional wells are planned for onshore in the gulf coast area or in east texas where several shallower exploration prospects have been defined from pioneer s d database 
the company s exploration programs in south africa  gabon  and the gulf coast transition zone are targeted for comprehensive studies that will focus on analysis  ranking and timing of prospects during seismic studies are currently planned to commence in gabon during late or early no new wells are planned during in south africa  where the company is evaluating farmout and other risk sharing opportunities 
in comparison  during  the company intends to use the excess of cash provided by operating activities over capital expenditures for oil and gas producing activities to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
asset divestitures 
the company has announced its intentions to sell non strategic oil and gas assets for gross proceeds of million to million in and as is discussed more fully below in trends and uncertainties asset dispositions  the company has entered into a purchase and sale agreement the agreement to sell certain non strategic oil and gas properties 
the proceeds to be realized from the disposition  if the agreement is consummated  are million  of which million represents an irrevocable option fee that has been paid to the company as of december  if consummated  the agreement requires a final payment to pioneer of million of proceeds on or before march  if the agreement is not consummated  the million of irrevocable option fees would be recognized as earnings 
the company is continuing to review its portfolio of oil and gas properties to identify other non strategic properties for divestiture 
the realization of the company s plans to divest of the other non strategic oil and gas properties in or in is contingent upon  among other things  the company s ability to find one or more purchasers willing to purchase the non strategic assets at prices acceptable to the company and the purchasers ability to complete the transaction 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in completing the divestitures in or in the company intends to use divestiture proceeds  if such proceeds are realized  to reduce outstanding indebtedness during and cost containment 
in  the company initiated a number of cost containment measures 
such measures included centralizing its domestic operations which resulted in the closing of its regional offices in oklahoma city  oklahoma  corpus christi  texas and houston  texas  the termination of employees  including several officer positions  and the reduction of salaries among senior officers 
these initiatives were designed to increase operational and administrative efficiencies  thereby reducing future production costs and general and administrative costs per boe 
associated with these initiatives  the company anticipates that additional reorganization charges of approximately million will be recognized during the first quarter of see note n of notes to consolidated financial statement included in item financial statements and supplementary data for specific discussion and disclosures regarding the company s reorganization provisions 
hedging activities 
the declines in commodity prices have had  and continue to have  a significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
to mitigate the impact of changing prices on the company s financial condition and results of operations  pioneer  from time to time  enters into commodity derivative contracts as hedges against oil and gas price risk 
as of december   the company had entered into hedge contracts for a combined notional volume of mmcf of natural gas per day at a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu the company has sold put options for a notional volume of mmcf per day at an average index price of per mmbtu  thereby releasing the average hedge floor on mmcf per day of gas to the lesser of per mmbtu or the index price plus 
per mmbtu 
see notes b  c and j of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
income taxes 
the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
the company believes that there is a risk  in light of the current economic conditions in the oil and gas industry  that certain of its net operating loss carryforwards and other credit carryforwards may expire unused 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company must reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax assets if it cannot be determined that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the deferred tax assets in future operating periods 
accordingly  the company has established a valuation allowance of million in to reduce the carrying value of the assets 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  the company believes it is more likely than not that they will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax planning strategies 
however  the net deferred tax assets could be reduced further if the company s estimate of taxable income in future periods is significantly reduced or alternative tax planning strategies are no longer viable 
as a result of this situation  it is likely that the company s effective tax rate in will be minimal or nil if the company recognizes a loss before income taxes 
if the company recognizes income before income taxes in  its effective tax rate will be reduced to the extent that taxable earnings are recognized in those tax jurisdictions relative to which the company established its valuation allowances 
credit facilities 
as of december   the company was a borrower under three separate credit facilities the credit facilities that provided for combined loan commitments of billion  comprised of a billion primary credit facility the primary facility that matures on august   a million canadian credit facility  the canadian facility  which converted in the fourth quarter of to a million term loan that matures on december   and an million credit facility the day facility that matures on august  on december   the company had million of outstanding borrowings under the primary facility  million of outstanding borrowings under the canadian facility and no borrowings under the day facility 
as of december   advances on the credit facilities bear interest at the option of the company  based on a the prime rate of nationsbank of texas  na prime rate percent at december   b a eurodollar rate substantially equal to the london interbank offered rate libor adjusted for the reserve requirement as determined by the board of governors of the federal reserve system with respect to transactions in eurocurrency liabilities libor rate  or c a competitive bid rate as quoted by the lending banks electing to participate pursuant to a request by the borrower 
the interest rates on the libor rate advances vary  with the interest rate margin ranging from basis points to basis points  including commitment utilization fees 
on march   the company and the syndicate of banks participating in the credit facilities executed amendments to the credit facilities that provide for a million reduction in the combined loan commitments under the credit facilities by december   an increase in the maximum interest rate margin on libor rate advances to basis points  including facility and leverage fees  provisions  under certain circumstances  for enhancing the participating banks collateral rights  and  amendment of certain associated debt covenants  the most restrictive covenant requires the maintenance of a ratio of outstanding company senior debt to earnings before interest  depletion  depreciation  amortization  income taxes  exploration and abandonment and other non cash expenses ebitdax not to exceed to one through september   to one through march   and to one thereafter 
additionally  the amendment provisions provide for the consolidation of the primary facility and the canadian facility 
the amendments to the credit facilities will decrease the company s liquidity and are expected to increase the company s weighted average rate of interest on outstanding indebtedness 
to satisfy the commitment reduction provisions of the amended credit facilities  the company intends to reduce its outstanding borrowings through the use of funds generated by the individual or combined sources of operating activities  oil and gas property divestitures  borrowings under subordinated debt agreements or additional issuances of equity 
the ultimate impact of the amendments on the company s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the year ending december  is uncertain and will depend on the amount of debt reduction that the company is able to achieve in see results of operations capital commitments  capital resources and liquidity  below  and note e to notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussions relative to the company s credit facilities and outstanding borrowings 
trends and uncertainties commodity prices the realized oil and gas prices that pioneer reports are based on the market price received for the commodity adjusted by the results of the company s hedging activities 
historically  worldwide oil and gas prices have been volatile and subject to significant changes in response to real and perceived conditions in world politics  weather patterns and other fundamental supply and demand variables 
since  there has been a declining trend in world oil prices and  more recently but to a lesser extent  natural gas prices 
the benchmark daily average nymex west texas intermediate crude oil closing price for the year ended december  has declined percent and percent  respectively  as compared with the same averages for and  and  the benchmark daily average nymex henry hub closing natural gas price for the year ended december  has declined percent and percent  respectively  as compared with the same averages for and asset dispositions as is discussed in outlook  above  the company has announced its intentions to sell non strategic oil and gas assets for gross proceeds of million to million in and in february  the company announced its intentions to sell domestic non strategic properties and subsequently signed a purchase and sale agreement the agreement to sell certain oil and gas properties representing approximately percent of the company s proved reserves 
in december  pioneer announced the re negotiation of the agreement and the sale of an exclusive and irrevocable option to the buyer to purchase the same properties on or before march  the proceeds associated with the re negotiated terms total million  of which million represents an irrevocable option fee that has been paid to the company as of december  the company s realization of the remaining million of proceeds  which would be used to reduce outstanding indebtedness  is primarily dependent upon the buyer s ability to finance the purchase and certain other contingencies defined in the agreement 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the divestiture of any or all of the properties will be completed or that the remaining proceeds will be realized 
the company is continuing to review its portfolio of oil and gas properties to identify other non strategic properties for divestiture 
the realization of the company s plans to divest of the other non strategic oil and gas properties in or in is contingent upon  among other things  the company s ability to find one or more purchasers willing to purchase the non strategic assets at prices acceptable to the company and the purchasers ability to complete the transaction 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in completing the divestitures in or in asset impairments and valuation allowances neither the longevity nor the extent of the current trend of declining commodity prices can be assessed with any degree of certainty 
a continuation of the trend  or other relevant factors  could result in further impairment provisions to the carrying value of the company s proved and unproved properties or additional valuation allowances to the company s deferred tax assets in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see notes b  m and o of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional information and disclosures regarding the company s accounting policies and attributes pertaining to asset impairments and income tax valuation allowances 
foreign currencies the company has oil and gas business dealings in canada  argentina  south africa and gabon 
historically  crude oil sales contracts have been united states dollar denominated  which significantly reduces foreign currency risks associated with crude oil operations 
additionally  the canadian dollar to united states dollar exchange rate remains relatively stable 
the functional currency of the company s argentine operations is the argentine peso 
presently  the argentine peso is valued on a one to one relationship with the united states dollar 
the functional currencies of the company s south african and gabon operations are the united states dollar 
the company s operations in south africa and gabon are not presently of a magnitude that would generate significant foreign currency risk 
although the above described currency relationships are not expected to change significantly in the near future  economic and other factors can cause significant and sudden changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially impact the company s financial position and future results of operations 
year project readiness historically  many computer programs have been developed that use only the last two digits in a date to refer to a year 
as the year nears  the inability of such computer programs and embedded technologies to distinguish between and has given rise to the year problem 
theoretically  such computer programs and related technology could fail outright or communicate inaccurate data  if not remediated or replaced 
with the proliferation of electronic data interchange  the year problem represents a significant exposure to the entire global community  the full extent of which cannot be accurately assessed 
in proactive response to the year problem  the company established a year project to assess  to the extent possible  the company s internal year problem  to take remedial actions necessary to minimize the year risk exposure to the company and significant third parties with whom it has data interchange  and  to test its systems and processes once remedial actions have been taken 
the company has contracted with ibm global services to perform the assessment and remedial phases of its year project 
the assessment phase of the company s year project is at varying stages of completion as it pertains to information technology and non information technology applications and systems in the united states  canada and argentina 
as of december   the company estimates that the assessment phase is approximately percent complete on a worldwide basis and has included  but is not limited to  the following procedures the identification of necessary remediation  upgrade and or replacement of existing information technology applications and systems  the assessment of non information technology exposures  such as telecommunications systems  security systems  elevators and process control equipment  the initiation of inquiry and dialogue with significant third party business partners  customers and suppliers in an effort to understand and assess their year problems  readiness and potential impact on the company and its year problem  the implementation of processes designed to reduce the risk of reintroduction of year problems into the company s systems and business processes  and  the formulation of contingency plans for mission critical information technology systems 
the company expects to complete the assessment phase of its year project by the end of the first quarter of but is being delayed by limited responses received on inquiries made of third party businesses 
to date  the company has distributed year problem inquiries to over entities and has received responses to approximately percent of those inquiries 
the remedial phase of the company s year project is also at varying stages of completion as it pertains to the remediation of information technology and non information technology applications and systems in the united states  canada and argentina 
as of december   the company estimates that the remedial phase is approximately percent complete  on a worldwide basis  subject to the continuing results of the third party inquiry assessments and the testing phase 
the remedial phase has included the upgrade and or replacement of certain application and hardware systems 
the company has upgraded its artesia general ledger accounting systems through remedial coding and is currently testing this system for year compliance 
the remediation of non information technology is expected to be completed during july the company s year remedial actions have not significantly delayed other information technology projects or upgrades 
the testing phase of the company s year project is on schedule 
the company expects to complete the testing of the artesia system upgrades by march and all other information technology systems and non information technology remediation by the end of the third quarter of the company expects that its total costs related to the year problem will approximate million  of which approximately thousand will have been incurred to replace non compliant information technology systems 
the company intends to use its working capital to pay for the costs of the year projects 
as of december   the company s total costs incurred on the year problem were million  of which thousand were incurred to replace non compliant systems 
the risks associated with the year problem are significant 
a failure to remedy a critical year problem could have a materially adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the most likely worst case scenario which may be encountered as a result of a year problem could include information and non information system failures  the receipt or transmission of erroneous data  lost data or a combination of similar problems of a magnitude that cannot be accurately assessed at this time 
in the assessment phase of the company s year project  contingency plans are being designed to mitigate the exposures to mission critical information technology systems  such as oil and gas sales receipts  vendor and royalty cash distributions  debt compliance  accounting  and  employee compensation 
such contingency plans anticipate the extensive utilization of third party data processing services  personal computer applications and the substitution of courier and mail services in place of electronic data interchange 
given the uncertainties regarding the scope of the year problem and the compliance of significant third parties  there can be no assurance that contingency plans will have anticipated all year scenarios 
accounting for derivatives in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not determined what effect  if any  sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements

revenues from oil and gas operations totaled million in  million in and million in  representing a percent increase from to and a percent increase from to the revenue increase from to is reflective of a percent increase in boe production  offset by a percent  percent and percent decline in prices for oil  ngls and gas  respectively  from to the increase in production during was primarily attributable to a full year of production realized from the mesa and chauvco properties acquired in the increase in revenue from to is primarily attributable to increases in oil and gas production  offset by declines in commodity prices 
the majority of the increased production during was a direct result of the oil and gas properties acquired from mesa 
parker parsley historically accounted for processed natural gas production as wellhead production on a wet gas basis  while mesa accounted for processed natural gas production in two components natural gas liquids and dry residue gas 
the combined entities own three major gas processing facilities  and the majority of the gas processed by these facilities is owned by the company and produced by company operated properties 
consequently  the company now produces a higher proportion of processed gas relative to total natural gas production and accounts for any processed natural gas production as natural gas liquids and dry residue gas 
production volumes for increased by percent from  mboe to  mboe 
this increase is primarily reflective of a full year of production realized from the properties acquired from mesa and chauvco  but also was impacted favorably by the company s exploration and development projects 
the properties acquired from mesa and chauvco contributed percent of the production growth from to excluding the production associated with the mesa and chauvco properties and other properties sold during and  production increased nine percent during  as compared to  on a boe basis 
on a boe basis  production increased by percent for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in the additional production volumes from the mesa properties contributed percent of production growth from to the remainder of the increase is a direct result of the successes of the company s exploration and exploitation efforts 
such production growth was particularly evident in light of the fact that a portion of the average daily oil and gas production for related to properties included in the sale of the company s australasian subsidiaries and the sale of certain non strategic domestic assets 
excluding production associated with assets sold during and the mesa properties acquired in  on a boe basis  production increased percent for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended the average oil price received for the year ended december  decreased percent from per bbl in to per bbl in  the average ngl price received in decreased percent from per bbl in to per bbl in  and the average gas price received in decreased percent from per mcf in to per mcf in 
the average oil price received for the year ended december  decreased seven percent from per bbl in to per bbl in  and the average gas price received decreased three percent from per mcf in to per mcf in 
during  the company received an average of per bbl for ngls 
hedging activities the oil and gas prices that the company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the company s hedging activities 
the company utilizes commodity derivative contracts swaps  futures and options in order to i reduce the effect of the volatility of price changes on the commodities the company produces and sells  ii support the company s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii lock in prices to protect the economics related to certain capital projects

see note j of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for information concerning the company s open hedge positions at december  and the related prices to be realized 
production costs 
total production costs per boe decreased in and by approximately percent and percent  respectively from in to in to in 
the primary component of production costs  lease operating expense  remained constant in and decreased by percent in workover costs declined by percent in and seven percent in these costs represent the majority of the oil and gas property operating expenses over which the company has control and the costs on which the company has focused its reduction efforts 
production taxes  which are correlated with volumes and prices  declined percent in and percent in reflecting the decline in commodity prices over the past two years 
as discussed more fully in natural gas processing below  the company adopted a new method of reporting the financial results of its natural gas processing facilities in  and is now presenting these results as oil and gas production activities 
in and  the operating margin from the company s gas plants ie  third party processing revenues less processing costs and expenses are included in oil and gas production costs  specifically lease operating expense 
the additional reductions in lease operating expense during the three years ended december  are primarily due to the company s concentrated efforts to evaluate and reduce all operating costs and the sale of certain high operating cost properties during depletion expense 
depletion expense per boe decreased percent in to in from in and increased percent in from in 
the decrease in was primarily due to the provision for impairment that reduced the per boe carrying values of the company s oil and gas properties in accordance with sfas see impairment of oil and gas properties below 
the increase in depletion expense per boe in was primarily associated with the fair value allocated to mesa s long lived  low production cost natural gas reserves 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  the company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of the company s assets may have occurred 
declining commodity prices in and  the company s outlook for future commodity prices and performance issues relative to certain oil and gas properties  prompted impairment reviews 
as a result of these reviews  the company recognized non cash pre tax charges of million and billion in and  respectively  related to its proved oil and gas properties 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies sfas  the company periodically assesses its unproved properties to determine whether they have been impaired 
an unproved property may be impaired if the company does not intend to drill the prospect as a result of downward revisions to potential proved reserves  if the results of exploration or the company s outlook for future commodity prices indicate that the potential proved reserves are not sufficient to generate net cash flows to recover the investment required by the project  or if the company intends to sell the property for less than its carrying value 
the company has assessed its unproved oil and gas properties for impairment and in recognized a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of its unproved oil and gas properties 
exploration and abandonments geological and geophysical costs 
exploration and abandonments geological and geophysical costs totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth the components of the company s  and exploration and abandonments geological and geophysical costs year ended december  in thousands exploratory dry holes united states    argentina   canada  other foreign   geological and geophysical costs united states    argentina   canada  other foreign   leasehold abandonments and other    approximately percent of the company s exploration exploitation capital budget was spent on exploratory projects as compared to percent in and percent in the increase in exploratory costs is primarily due to the initial expenditures made to explore the argentine and canadian properties acquired from chauvco and the company s exploration program in south africa 
the increase in was primarily the result of increased domestic exploratory drilling and geological and geophysical activity due to the expansion of the company s exploration program
