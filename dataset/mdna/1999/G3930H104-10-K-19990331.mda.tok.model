china telecom of million and million received from the exercise of certain warrants and stock options 
current liabilities increased by million as compared to the prior year  to million at december   primarily as a result of the classification of a portion of vendor financing due within one year and the timing of payments to globalstar contractors and accrued interest on the senior notes 
globalstar plans to begin a regional roll out of commercial service in september with a minimum of eight gateways in operation 
by the end of  globalstar expects to have a total of at least gateways in operation 
all of the gateways on order have been manufactured and are ready for installation 
on march   globalstar successfully launched four satellites aboard a soyuz launch vehicle from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan  bringing the total satellites in orbit to this launch followed globalstar s successful launch on february  of four satellites from the baikonur cosmodrome following the execution of a technology safeguard agreement among the governments of russia  kazakhstan and the united states 
globalstar had previously launched its first group of four satellites on february  and its second group of four satellites on april  the first globalstar satellites have reached their final orbital positions and are currently being used to test basic system functionality  including the system s inter satellite hand off capabilities  and the latest four satellites are expected to reach their final orbital positions and begin operations testing in april as of march   in addition to the satellites in orbit  globalstar had eight completed satellites on hand and more in final integration and test 
in september  a malfunction of a zenit rocket resulted in the loss of globalstar satellites shortly after lift off from the baikonur cosmodrome and resulted in a delay in the program schedule 
the cost of the launch vehicle and the lost satellites was substantially insured 
for the remainder of  globalstar s current launch plan includes nine additional launches of four satellites each  using a mix of delta and soyuz rockets 
according to the plan  globalstar will deploy an operational constellation of a minimum of satellites by september and a total of satellites including four in orbit spares by the end of through december   globalstar incurred costs of approximately billion for the design and construction of the space and ground segments 
costs incurred during were approximately million 
qualcomm is in the process of completing its revision to cost estimates for its portion of the ground segment 
due to additional scope and cost growth and based on preliminary information  globalstar expects the increase from qualcomm to be less than of the total project cost 
the qualcomm estimate is still subject to further review by globalstar 
as of december   and including the effect of the preliminary qualcomm estimate  globalstar s budgeted expenditures were billion for the design  construction and deployment of the globalstar system to commence commercial service and million for budgeted financing costs 
in addition to expenditures for operating costs and debt service  globalstar anticipates further expenditures on system software for the improvement of system functionality and the addition of new features beyond those planned for the commencement of commercial service 
globalstar expects to achieve positive cash flow in the third quarter of substantial additional financing will be required if there are delays in the commencement of commercial service and  in any event  after the commencement of commercial service and before positive cash flow is achieved 
although globalstar believes it will be able to obtain these additional funds  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
globalstar has agreed  subject to its partners approval  to purchase from ss l additional spare satellites for which the cost and payment terms have not as yet been negotiated 
it is anticipated that approximately million will be expended for these spare satellites by commencement of commercial service 
in addition  in order to accelerate the deployment of gateways around the world  globalstar has agreed to help finance approximately million of the cost of up to of the initial gateways 
the contracts for the gateways aggregate approximately million 
ericsson  qualcomm and telital are in the process of manufacturing approximately  handheld and fixed user terminals under contracts totaling million from globalstar and its service providers 
globalstar has agreed to finance approximately million of the cost of handheld and fixed user terminals 
globalstar expects to recoup such costs upon acceptance by the service providers of the gateways and user terminals 
ss l provides globalstar with approximately million of billings deferred as follows million of vendor financing and million of orbital incentives 
ss l subcontractors have assumed a portion of the vendor financing commitments totaling approximately million 
the million of vendor financing consists of three tranches million  million and million 
only the million is interest bearing and bears interest at the day libor rate plus per annum 
globalstar will repay the million and the million tranches as follows will be paid over five years in equal monthly installments following the launch and acceptance of or more satellites the preliminary constellation and the remaining will be paid over five years in equal monthly installments following the launch and acceptance of or more satellites the full constellation 
payment of the million interest bearing vendor financing will be due beginning march  interest and principal will be repaid in equal quarterly installments over the next five years 
approximately million of the orbital incentives will be paid at both the preliminary constellation date and full constellation date with the remainder being paid with the delivery of the remaining satellites 
on march   qualcomm entered into a deferred payment agreement with globalstar providing for million of vendor financing 
the deferred payments accrue interest at a rate of per annum  which is added to the outstanding principal balance quarterly 
beginning january   globalstar will make eight equal quarterly principal payments 
the final payment including all unpaid interest is due october  in april  china telecom  through a subsidiary  exercised a warrant to purchase  globalstar ordinary partnership interests for  in addition  china telecom has a warrant to acquire an additional  globalstar ordinary partnership interests for  after commencement of service

results of operations comparison of results for the years ended december  and globalstar is a development stage partnership and has not commenced commercial operations 
for the period march  commencement of operations to december   globalstar has recorded cumulative net losses applicable to ordinary partnership interests of million 
the net loss applicable to ordinary partnership interests for increased to million as compared to million for the net loss for increased primarily as a result of the launch failure  increased activity in the development of globalstar user terminals and increased in house engineering and marketing expenses 
globalstar is expending significant funds for the construction  launch  testing and deployment of the globalstar system and expects such losses to continue until commencement of commercial operations 
globalstar earned interest income of million on cash and cash equivalent balances since commencement of operations 
interest income for was million as compared to million for  as a result of lower average cash balances available for investment during the current period 
operating expenses 
development costs represent the development of globalstar user terminals and globalstar s continuing in house engineering 
for  these costs were million as compared to million for development costs increased as a result of increased activity in the development of globalstar user terminals and in house engineering 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million and million for and  respectively 
the increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses are primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees and an increase in marketing costs as globalstar gears up for operations 
on september   a malfunction of a zenit rocket resulted in the loss of globalstar satellites 
a million loss on the launch failure was recorded in the third quarter of  which reflects the cost of the launch vehicle  satellites and related capitalized costs  net of insurance proceeds of million 
depreciation 
globalstar intends to capitalize all costs  including interest as applicable  associated with the design  construction and deployment of the globalstar system  except costs associated with the development of the globalstar user terminals and certain technologies under a cost sharing arrangement with qualcomm 
globalstar will not record depreciation expense on the globalstar system under construction until the commencement of commercial operations  as assets are placed into service 
income taxes 
globalstar is organized as a limited partnership 
as such  no income tax provision or benefit is included in the consolidated financial statements of globalstar which are incorporated herein by reference since us income taxes are the responsibility of its partners 
generally  taxable income or loss  deductions and credits of globalstar will be passed through to its partners 
comparison of results for the years ended december  and the net loss applicable to ordinary partnership interests for increased to million as compared to million for due to an increase in total operating costs and preferred distributions  partially offset by an increase in interest income 
interest income during was million as compared to million for  as a result of higher average cash balances available for investment during operating expenses 
development costs of million for represent the development of globalstar user terminals and globalstar s continuing in house engineering 
this compares with million of development costs incurred during the increase during is primarily the result of the increased activity in the development of the globalstar user terminals 
marketing  general and administrative expenses were million for as compared to million incurred during the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees  as globalstar gears up for operations and increased advertising costs 
taxation the company will be subject to us federal  state and local corporate tax on its share of globalstar s income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states us income and will be required to file federal  state and local income tax returns with respect to such us income 
the company expects  based on globalstar s description of its proposed activities  that most of the company s income will be from sources outside the united states and that such income will not be effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states foreign income 
thus  the company believes that there generally will be no us taxes on its share of globalstar s foreign income 
the irs may disagree  however  and or may promulgate regulations that would recharacterize a substantial portion of the company s income as derived from us sources and as effectively connected with a us trade or business so as to subject that income to regular us federal income tax and a branch profits tax 
in addition  any portion of the company s income from sources outside the united states  realized through globalstar or otherwise  may be subject to taxation by certain foreign countries 
however  the extent to which these countries may require the company or globalstar to pay tax or to make payments in lieu of tax cannot be determined in advance 
to the extent that globalstar bears a higher foreign tax because any holder of its ordinary partnership interests including the company is not subject to united states tax on its share of globalstar s foreign income  the additional foreign tax will be specially allocated to such partner and will reduce amounts distributed by globalstar to such partner with respect to the ordinary partnership interests held by such partner 
year issue globalstar s year program is proceeding on schedule 
the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to signify a year ie  the year is denoted as and not 
computer programs written using only two digits may recognize the year as the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations 
globalstar has implemented a year program the year program for its internal products  system and equipment  as well as for key vendor supplied products  system and equipment 
as part of the year program  globalstar is assessing the year capabilities of  among other things  its satellites  ground equipment  research and development activities  and facility management systems 
the year program consists of the following phases inventory of year items  assessment including prioritization  remediation including modification  upgrading and replacement  testing and auditing 
this five step program is divided into five major sections covering both information and non information technology systems business systems  technical systems  imbedded hardware firmware  products and services and vendor supplied services 
as of february   globalstar has completed approximately of the inventory phase and approximately of its assessment phase 
globalstar expects to complete the first three phases  through the remediation phase  of the year program during the second quarter of the testing phase will be completed during the third quarter of  prior to the anticipated in service date of globalstar 
the fifth phase  the audit phase  commenced in january  and is expected to continue through the third quarter of to accommodate re audits if deemed necessary 
both internal and external resources are being utilized to execute globalstar s plan 
the program to address year has been underway since july the incremental costs incurred through december  for this effort by globalstar were approximately  based on its efforts to date globalstar anticipates additional incremental expenses of approximately  will be incurred to substantially complete the effort 
based upon the accomplishments to date  no contingency plans are expected to be needed 
as risks are identified  contingency plans will be developed and implemented as necessary 
however  because of the progress achieved to date and globalstar s expectations that its year program will be substantially complete in the third quarter of calendar  globalstar believes adequate time will be available to insure alternatives can be developed  assessed and implemented prior to a year issue having a material negative impact on its operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications and conversions  if required  will be completed on a timely basis 
the cost of the program and the dates on which globalstar believes it will substantially complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
such estimates were derived using software surveys and programs to evaluate calendar date exposures and numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party year readiness and other factors 
because none of these estimates can be guaranteed  actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause an adjustment of costs are number of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the ability to validate supplier certification and similar uncertainties 
globalstar s failure to remediate a material year problem could result in an interruption or failure of certain basic business operations 
these failures could materially and adversely effect globalstar s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
globalstar is also assessing the year readiness of its key third party suppliers 
information requests have been distributed to such suppliers and replies are being evaluated 
if the risk is deemed material  on site visits to suppliers will be conducted to verify the adequacy of the information received 
in addition  globalstar has commenced discussions with its service providers to determine the status of their year capabilities 
however  due to the general uncertainty of the year problem  including uncertainty with regard to third party suppliers and service providers  especially those in developing countries  globalstar is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have an adverse material impact on globalstar s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company s year program will be successful in avoiding any interruption or failure of certain basic business operations  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
globalstar has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its earnings or financial position 
globalstar is required to adopt sfas on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the fair value of globalstar s long term debt and interest bearing vendor financing collectively  long term obligations is estimated to be billion using quoted market prices or  in the case of vendor financing  recorded value 
the long term obligations carrying value exceeded fair value by million 
market risk on long term obligations is estimated as the potential increase in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical one percent increase in interest rates and amounts to million
