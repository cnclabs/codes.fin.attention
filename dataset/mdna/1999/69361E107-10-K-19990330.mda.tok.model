market risk at december   the company had outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts to sell million of various currencies 
the difference between the fair value of these outstanding contracts and the contract amounts was immaterial 
a hypothetical fluctuation in exchange rates for these currencies would change the fair value by approximately million 
however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transactions being hedged 
the net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries at december  totaled million 
the potential loss in net assets resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements aggregating a notional principal amount of million 
these swaps effectively change the company s payment of interest on million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt

a hypothetical decrease in the day commercial paper rates would decrease the fair value by approximately million 
the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt was million  including current maturities  at december  a hypothetical increase from prevailing interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in fair value of long term debt by approximately million 
year the year problem is the result of many existing computer programs written in two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
accordingly  date sensitive software or hardware may not be able to distinguish between the year and year  and programs that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or sorting of date fields may begin yielding incorrect results 
this potentially could cause a system failure or miscalculations that could disrupt operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
these year issues affect virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has developed a three phase plan to address its year issues identification of software and hardware 
this includes the following a applications and information technology it equipment  which includes all mainframe  network and desktop software and hardware  custom and packaged applications  and it embedded systems  b non information technology non it embedded systems 
this includes non it equipment and machinery 
non it embedded systems  such as security  fire prevention and climate control systems typically include embedded technology  and c vendor relationships 
this includes significant third party vendors and supplier interfaces 
both domestically and internationally  the company has substantially completed the identification stage 
assessment of the software and hardware identified 
this phase includes the evaluation of the software and hardware identified for year compliance  the determination of the remediation method and resources required  and the development of an implementation plan 
a significant portion of the assessment stage has been completed 
the company expects this phase to be fully completed by the end of march implementation of a remediation plan 
this phase includes testing some modifications upgrades in a year simulated environment and vendor interface testing  if necessary 
the company has commenced implementation  both domestically and internationally  and expects this phase to be completed by the end of august the company s remediation plan for its year issue is an ongoing process and the estimated completion dates above are subject to change 
overall  at this time  the company believes that its systems will be year compliant in a timely manner for several reasons 
several significant operating systems are already compliant 
internationally  the company is currently implementing new computer systems that were developed in the united states and are currently year compliant 
to the extent that current systems that will not be replaced have been determined to be non compliant  the company is working with the suppliers of such systems to obtain upgrades and or enhancements to ensure year compliance 
also  comprehensive testing of all critical systems is planned to be conducted in a simulated year environment 
the company believes that it will not be required to modify or replace significant portions of the products it presently develops and provides to customers as such products are not date dependent and  accordingly  will function properly with respect to dates in the year all new products will be year ready when released 
at this stage in the process  the company has not identified any significant risks 
however  the company believes that the area of the greatest potential risk relates to significant suppliers failing to remediate their year issues in a timely manner 
the company is conducting formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which it may be affected by those parties plans to remediate their own year issue in a timely manner 
if a number of significant suppliers are not year compliant  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
at this point  the company has not been advised by any significant supplier that it will not be year compliant 
the company is developing its contingency plans and expects to have them completed by june to mitigate the effects of the company s or significant suppliers potential failure to remediate the year issue in a timely manner  the company will take appropriate actions 
such actions may include having arrangements for alternate suppliers  using manual intervention to ensure the continuation of operations where necessary and scheduling activity in december that would normally occur at the beginning of january if it becomes necessary for the company to take these corrective actions  it is uncertain  until the contingency plans are finalized  whether this would result in significant delays in business operations or have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
based upon the company s current estimates  incremental out of pocket costs of its year program are expected not to be material 
these costs are expected to be incurred primarily in fiscal and will be associated primarily with the remediation of existing computer software and hardware 
such costs are estimated to be approximately million 
such costs do not include internal management time  which the company does not separately track  nor the deferral of other projects  the effects of which are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s total year project costs include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that other companies upon which the company relies will be able to address in a timely manner their year compliance issues  the effects of which may be an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing legacy currencies and the euro 
the legacy currencies will remain in effect until july   at which time  the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions 
the company has not yet determined the impact of the euro conversion 
however  the company believes  but can give no assurance  that the conversion will not have a material adverse impact to results of operations  financial position or cash flows
