item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides additional information regarding our operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  and financial condition for the fiscal years ended june  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included or incorporated by reference elsewhere in this document 
overview quad city was formed in february for the purpose of organizing the bank 
the bank opened in january with million in assets and grew to approximately million as of june  management expects continued opportunities for growth  even though the rate of growth will probably be slower than that experienced to date 
quad city reported earnings of million or basic earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million and per share for fiscal and million and per share for fiscal the slight improvement in fiscal from fiscal was attributable to increased net interest income and increased volumes of business for the bank  reduced by a decrease in noninterest income 
the decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the one time gain in fiscal resulting from the restructuring of bancard s merchant broker agreement 
the improvement in fiscal from fiscal was also attributable to increase net interest income and increased volumes of business for the bank  as well as the one time gain resulting from the restructuring of bancard s merchant broker agreement 
quad city s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
quad city s operating results are also affected by sources of non interest income  including merchant credit card fees  trust fees  deposit service charge fees  fees from the sales of residential real estate loans and other income 
operating expenses of quad city include employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expense and other administrative expenses 
quad city s operating results are also affected by economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
the majority of the bank s loan portfolio is invested in commercial loans 
deposits from commercial customers represent a significant funding source as well 
the bank has added facilities and employees to accommodate both its historical growth and anticipated future growth 
as such  overhead expenses have had a significant impact on earnings 
the primary challenge for the bank currently  from a profitability standpoint  is to increase its net interest margin 
large commercial depositors create a relatively high cost of funds and this fact  along with a very competitive loan rate environment  have resulted in the bank s interest margin being below its peer group 
management is addressing this issue with alternative funding sources and pricing strategies 
during  the bank began to develop internally a merchant credit card processing operation and in transferred this activity to bancard  a separate subsidiary of quad city 
bancard initially had an arrangement to provide processing services exclusively to clients of a single iso 
this iso was sold in and the purchaser requested a reduction in the term of the contract 
bancard agreed to amend the contract to reduce the term and accept a fixed monthly processing fee of  for merchants existing at the time the agreement was signed and a lower transaction fee for new merchants in exchange for a payment of million  the ability to transact business with other isos and the assumption of the credit risk by the iso 
approximately two thirds of the income from this settlement  or million  was reported in fiscal  with the remainder of  being recognized as an adjustment to the fixed processing fee during fiscal bancard s net income was  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal bancard expects its merchant credit card fee income to remain below previous levels until such time as bancard can develop relationships with additional isos or allied merchant services  inc  bancard s newly formed independent sales organization  can generate processing business revenues comparable to those bancard experienced prior to amendment of its iso contract 
this reduction in processing fees and cessation of the settlement income at bancard is expected to adversely affect comparisons of consolidated net income in fiscal with fiscal during fiscal  the bank expanded its presence in the mortgage banking market by hiring several experienced loan originators and an experienced underwriter 
the bank originates mortgage loans on personal residences and sells the majority of these loans into the secondary market to avoid the interest rate risk associated with long term fixed rate financing 
the bank realizes revenue from this mortgage banking activity from a combination of loan origination fees and gain on sale of the loans in the secondary market 
during fiscal  the bank originated million of real estate loans and sold million of loans  which resulted in gains of million 
in fiscal and  the bank originated million and million of real estate loans and sold million and million of loans  which resulted in gains of  and  respectively 
mortgage banking operations have benefited from significant refinancing activity as a result of the relatively low interest rate environment in which it has been operating 
trust department income has become a significant contributor to noninterest income  growing from approximately  in fiscal to  in fiscal income is generated primarily from fees charged based on assets under management for corporate and personal trusts and for custodial services 
assets under administration have grown from at june  to million at june  growth in the current fiscal year resulted primarily from the establishment of a custodial relationship with a large pension fund 
quad city s initial public offering during the fourth calendar quarter of raised approximately million 
in order to provide additional capital to support the growth of the bank  quad city formed a statutory business trust to issue million of capital securities to the public for cash 
on june   the company received all the proceeds from the sale of the public offering 
approximately of the proceeds were used to pay expenses related to the offering  approximately million were used to repay the outstanding balance on a revolving credit note and approximately million was used to redeem all outstanding preferred stock  including the redemption premium 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal overview 
net income for the year ended june  was million as compared to net income of million for the same period in for a slight increase of  or

the decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to the one time gain in fiscal resulting from the restructuring of bancard s merchant broker agreement 
interest income 
interest income increased by million  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the rise in interest income was basically attributable to greater average outstanding balances in interest earning assets  principally loans receivable 
interest expense

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is established based on factors such as the local and national economy and the risk associated with the loans in the portfolio 
quad city had an allowance for estimated losses on loans of approximately of total loans at june  as compared to approximately at june  the provision for loan losses decreased slightly by  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the primary loan growth for the year ended june  was in the commercial loan portfolio  as opposed to our consumer loan portfolio  which has historically carried a greater degree of risk  allowing a decrease in the provision necessary for the period 
for fiscal  commercial and real estate loans combined for total charge offs of  and total recoveries of  consumer loan charge offs and recoveries totaled  and  respectively  for fiscal indirect auto loans accounted for a majority of the consumer loan charge offs 
because asset quality is a priority for quad city and its subsidiaries  management has made the decision to downscale indirect auto loan activity based on charge off history 
the ability to grow profitably is  in part  dependent upon the ability to maintain asset quality

the amended agreement exchanges a substantial reduction in merchant servicing income for a like reduction in the related merchant credit risk 
with the amended agreement  quad city receives a fixed  monthly fee of  for servicing the current merchants and is relieved of responsibility for any merchant credit risk 
in an effort to offset the reduced merchant servicing income  quad city has been actively pursuing other iso relationships and has recently begun processing for additional isos

cash and cash equivalent assets 
cash and due from banks decreased by million or to million at june  from million at june  cash and due from banks represented both cash maintained at the bank  as well as funds that the bank and quad city had deposited in other banks in the form of demand deposits 
federal funds sold are inter bank funds with daily liquidity 
federal funds sold increased by million or to million at june  from million at june  the increase was attributable to quad city s increased liquidity needs at the end of the fiscal year

as of june   the bank s legal lending limit was million 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for estimated losses on loans was million at june  compared to million at june  for an increase of  or 
the adequacy of the allowance for estimated losses on loans was determined by management based on factors that included the overall composition of the loan portfolio  types of loans  past loss experience  loan delinquencies  potential substandard and doubtful credits  and other factors that  in management s judgment  deserved evaluation in estimating loan losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for estimated losses on loans was monitored by the loan review staff  and reported to management and the board of directors 
net charge offs for the years ended june  and  were  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to the losses resulting from auto loans purchased from dealers 
quad city has since scaled back on this type of lending 
one measure of the adequacy of the allowance for estimated losses on loans is the ratio of the allowance to the total loan portfolio 
provisions were made monthly to ensure that an adequate level was maintained 
the allowance for estimated losses on loans as a percentage of total loans was at june  and at june  although management believes that the allowance for estimated losses on loans at june  was at a level adequate to absorb losses on existing loans  there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that quad city will not be required to make additional provisions for loan losses in the future 
asset quality is a priority for quad city and its subsidiaries 
the ability to grow profitably is in part dependent upon the ability to maintain that quality 
nonperforming assets 
the policy of quad city is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if a payment in full of interest or principal is not expected or b principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the obligation is both in the process of collection and well secured 
well secured is defined as collateral with sufficient market value to repay principal and all accrued interest 
a debt is in the process of collection if collection of the debt is proceeding in due course either through legal action  including judgment enforcement procedures  or in appropriate circumstances  through collection efforts not involving legal action which are reasonably expected to result in repayment of the debt or in its restoration to current status 
nonaccrual loans were million at june  compared to million at june  for an increase of  or 
the increase in nonaccrual loans was comprised of increases in commercial loans of  and consumer loans of  offset by a decrease in real estate loans of  nonaccrual loans at june  consisted primarily of loans that were well collateralized and were not expected to result in material losses 
as of june  and  past due loans of days or more amounted to million and million  respectively 
quad city anticipated an increase in the dollar amount of this category in fiscal from the prior years 
in prior years  much of the loan portfolio had been on the books for a relatively short time  thus an increase in past due loans was likely as the portfolio matured 
past due loans as a percentage of gross loans receivable was and at june   and  respectively 
other assets 
premises and equipment decreased by  or to million at june  from million at june  the decrease resulted from depreciation expense offset by the purchase of additional furniture  fixtures and equipment 
additional information regarding the composition of this account and related accumulated depreciation is described in footnote to the consolidated financial statements

other borrowings consisted of the amount outstanding on a revolving credit note with a third party lender  which is secured by all the outstanding stock of the bank 
on july   quad city increased the amount available under the credit note to million and extended the expiration date to july  the borrowed funds were utilized to provide additional capital to the bank to maintain a aggregate capital ratio 
on june   using the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities  quad city paid off the balance of its outstanding line of credit  which was million 
after the outstanding balance was paid off  the note was rewritten and decreased the amount available under the credit note to million while maintaining the july  expiration date

common stock increased by  or to million as of june  from million as of june  the increase was caused by i exercises of stock warrants and options resulting in the issuance of  additional shares of common stock  and ii a for stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  effective november   which resulted in the issuance of an additional  shares of common stock 
additional paid in capital decreased by million or to million as of june  from million as of june  the decrease resulted from the excess of the per share par value for the shares of series a preferred stock redeemed  and the transfer of  from additional paid in capital to common stock representing the issuance of additional common shares from the for stock split

accumulated other comprehensive income loss  consisting of unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale  net of related income taxes  was a  loss as of june  as compared to a  gain as of june  the decrease was attributable to the decrease during the period in fair value of the securities identified as available for sale mainly as a result of an increase in interest rates 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability of quad city to meet maturing obligations and its existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund its operations  and to provide for customers credit needs 
one source of liquidity is cash and short term assets  such as interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold  which totaled million at june   compared with million at june  another source of liquidity is borrowing capability 
the bank has a variety of sources of short term liquidity available to it  including federal funds purchased from correspondent banks  sales of securities available for sale  fhlb advances and loan participations or sales 
quad city also generates liquidity from the regular principal payments and prepayments made on its portfolio of loans and mortgage backed securities 
the liquidity of quad city is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  was million for the year ended june  compared to million of cash used  primarily for loans originated for sale  for the year ended june  net cash used in investing activities  consisting principally of loan funding and the purchase of securities  was million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  net cash provided by financing activities  consisting primarily of deposit growth  proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities of the subsidiary trust  and proceeds from short term borrowings  for the year ended june  was million and for the year ended june  was million  consisting principally of deposit growth and proceeds from federal home loan bank advances

net cash inflows from financing activities totaled million for the year ended june   compared to cash inflows of million for the year ended june  the components of the net cash inflows were primarily from the growth of deposit accounts as well as the increase in fhlb advances and other borrowings 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of quad city s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of quad city are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on quad city s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement addresses the accounting for derivative instruments and certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  and is not expected to have a material effect on quad city s consolidated financial position or results of operation 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
when used herein  the terms anticipates  plans  expects  believes  and similar expressions as they relate to quad city or its management are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
quad city s actual results  performance or achievements may materially differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such material differences include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the financial services industry  changes in law  unforeseen business risks related to year computer systems issues  government policies and regulations  and rapidly changing technology affecting financial services 
year the year has posed a unique set of challenges to those industries reliant on information technology 
as a result of methods employed by early programmers  many software applications and operational programs may be unable to distinguish the year from the year if not effectively addressed  this problem could result in the production of inaccurate data  or  in the worst cases  the inability of the systems to continue to function altogether 
financial institutions are particularly vulnerable due to the industry s dependence on electronic data processing systems 
in  quad city started the process of identifying the hardware and software issues required to be addressed to assure year compliance 
quad city began by assessing the issues related to the year and the potential for those issues to adversely affect quad city s operations and those of its subsidiaries 
since that time  quad city has established a year committee to deal with this issue 
the committee meets with and utilizes various representatives from key areas throughout the organization to aid in analysis and testing 
it is the mission of this committee to identify areas subject to complications related to the year and to initiate remedial measures designed to eliminate any adverse effects on quad city s operations 
the committee has identified all mission critical software and hardware that may be adversely affected by the year and has requested vendors to represent that the systems and products provided are or will be year compliant 
quad city licenses all software used in conducting its business from third party vendors 
none of quad city s software has been internally developed 
quad city has developed a comprehensive list of all software  all hardware and all service providers used by quad city 
every vendor has been contacted regarding the year issue  and quad city continues to closely track the progress each vendor is making in resolving the problems associated with the issue 
the vendor of the primary software in use at quad city released its year compliant software in may testing standards were formulated and comprehensive testing is now finalized 
quad city actively took part in a peer users group to aid the testing process 
users of the primary software continue to meet regularly to discuss year testing issues and results 
in addition  quad city continues to monitor all other major vendors of services to quad city for year issues in order to avoid shortages of supplies and services in the coming months 
quad city has not had any material delay regarding its information systems projects as a result of the year project 
there are four third party utilities with which quad city has an important relationship  ameritech  mcleod and us west phone service  and midamerican energy corporation electricity and natural gas 
quad city has not identified any practical  long term alternatives to relying on these companies for basic utility services 
in the event that the utilities significantly curtail or interrupt their services to quad city  it would have a significant adverse effect on quad city s ability to conduct business 
information received from these utilities indicates that they have significantly completed remediation and validation of their mission critical applications 
quad city also has tested such things as vault doors  fax machines  security systems  elevators  stand alone personal computers  networks  etc 
for year functionality and is not aware of any significant problems with such systems 
although quad city does not believe that the failure of these systems would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  it is addressing deficiencies in these systems and expects compliance to be achieved by september  quad city s cumulative costs of the year project through fiscal were  the estimated total cost of the year project is  this includes costs to upgrade equipment specifically for the purpose of year compliance and certain administrative expenditures 
at the present time  no situations that will require material cost expenditures to become fully compliant have been identified 
however  the year problem is pervasive and complex and can potentially affect any computer process 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without additional unanticipated expenditures and uncertainties that might affect future financial results 
it is not possible at this time to quantify the estimated future costs due to possible business disruption caused by vendors  suppliers  customers  or even the possible loss of electric power or phone service  however  such costs could be substantial 
quad city is committed to a plan for achieving compliance  focusing not only on its own data processing systems  but also on its loan and depository customers 
the year committee has taken steps to educate and assist its customers with identifying their year compliance problems  if any 
in addition  the management committee has proposed policy and procedure changes to help identify potential risks to quad city and to gain an understanding of how customers are managing the risks associated with the year quad city is assessing the impact  if any  of the year risk in its credit analysis 
quad city also utilizes loan agreements and other legal documentation to ensure large corporate borrowers acknowledge year compliance requirements 
in connection with potential credit risk related to the year issue  quad city has contacted its large commercial loan and depository customers regarding their level of preparedness for the year through these questionnaires and resulting assessments  quad city believes that overall credit and liquidity risk to its large corporate borrowers and depositors is not excessive 
quad city has developed contingency plans for various year problems in the event that unforeseen events beyond its control adversely impact our ability to provide financial services to our customers 
in the event of such a failure  these plans outline the steps that will be taken to minimize the effect on customers and losses to quad city 
the plan will be continually updated as more information becomes available based on testing results and vendor notifications 
the federal banking regulators issued guidelines establishing minimum safety and soundness standards for achieving year compliance 
the guidelines  which took effect october  and apply to all fdic insured depository institutions  establish standards for developing and managing year project plans  testing remediation efforts and planning for contingencies 
the guidelines are based upon guidance previously issued by the agencies under the auspices of the federal financial institutions examination council but are not intended to replace or supplant the federal financial institutions examination council guidance which will continue to apply to all federally insured depository institutions 
the guidelines were issued under section of the federal deposit insurance act  which requires the federal banking regulators to establish standards for the safe and sound operation of federally insured depository institutions 
under section of the federal deposit insurance act  if an institution fails to meet any of the standards established in the guidelines  the institution s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving compliance 
if an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan  or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator  the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency 
such an order is enforceable in court in the same manner as a cease and desist order 
until the deficiency cited in the regulator s order is cured  the regulator may restrict the institution s rate of growth  require the institution to increase its capital  restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances 
in addition to the enforcement procedures established in section of the federal deposit insurance act  noncompliance with the standards established by the guidelines may also be grounds for other enforcement action by the federal banking regulators  including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments 
quad city s management believes its year planning has been consistent with regulatory guidelines 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quad city  like other financial institutions  is subject to direct and indirect market risk 
direct market risk exists from changes in interest rates 
additionally  quad city s net income is dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net income 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management monitors quad city s interest rate risk 
the asset liability committee meets quarterly to review quad city s interest rate risk position and profitability  and to make or recommend adjustments for consideration by the board of directors 
management also reviews the bank s securities portfolio  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the board s objectives in the most effective manner 
notwithstanding quad city s interest rate risk management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income 
in adjusting quad city s asset liability position  the board and management attempt to manage quad city s interest rate risk while maintaining or enhancing net interest margins 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the board and management may determine to increase quad city s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to increase its net interest margin 
quad city s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to increases in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
one approach used to quantify interest rate risk is the net portfolio value npv analysis 
in essence  this analysis calculates the difference between the present value of liabilities and the present value of expected cash flows from assets and off balance sheet contracts 
the following table sets forth  at june  and june   an analysis of quad city s interest rate risk as measured by the estimated changes in npv resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve or basis points 
change in estimated increase decrease in npv interest rates estimated npv amount amount percent basis points june  june  june  june  june  june  dollars in thousands quad city does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  quad city does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting quad city 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of quad city s business activities
