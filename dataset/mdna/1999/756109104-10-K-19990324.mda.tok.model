we are a fully integrated self administered real estate company with in house acquisition  leasing  legal  retail research  real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
as of december   we owned a diversified portfolio of retail properties located in states with over million square feet of leasable space 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly dividends from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations ffo per share 
additionally  we generally will seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
page liquidity and capital resources cash reserves realty income is organized for the purpose of operating as an equity reit which acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of its net cash flow generated from leases on its retail properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital reserves 
at december   realty income had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  however  we intend to utilize additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay our acquisition credit facility 
capital funding realty income has a million  three year revolving  unsecured acquisition credit facility of which million expires in december and million expires in december the credit facility currently bears interest at over the london interbank offered rate libor and offers us other interest rate options 
as of march   million of borrowing capacity was available to us under the acquisition credit facility 
at that time  the outstanding balance was million with an effective interest rate of 
this credit facility has been and is expected to be used to acquire additional retail properties leased to national and regional retail chains under long term lease agreements 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we expect to meet our long term capital needs for the acquisition of properties through the issuance of public or private debt or equity 
in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission covering up to million in value of common stock  preferred stock and or debt securities 
through march   million in value of common stock and debt securities has been issued under the universal shelf registration statement 
in march  we issued  shares of common stock to a unit investment trust at a net price to the company of per share  based on the then market price of per share 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay borrowings of million under our credit facility and to acquire additional properties 
in february  we issued  shares of common stock to a unit investment trust at a net price to the company of per share  based on a discount to the then market price of per share 
the net proceeds of million were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
page in january  we issued million of senior notes due january the notes 
the notes are unsecured and were sold at of par to yield 
the proceeds from the offering were used to pay down credit facility borrowings and for other corporate purposes 
currently  there is no formal trading market for the notes and we have not listed and do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange 
in october  we issued million of unsecured senior notes due november the notes 
the notes were sold at par 
after taking into effect the results of a treasury interest rate lock agreement  the effective interest rate to us was 
the proceeds from the offering were used to pay down million of our credit facility borrowings and will allow us to continue our strategic property acquisition activities 
interest on the notes is payable monthly on the th of each month  commencing in december the notes commenced trading on the new york stock exchange on november  under the ticker symbol oui 
the cusip number of the notes is aa in may  we entered into a treasury interest rate lock agreement to protect against the possibility of rising interest rates applicable to the notes 
under the interest rate lock agreement  we were to receive or make a payment based on the differential between a specified interest rate   and the actual year treasury interest rate on a notional principal amount of million  at the end of six months 
based on the year treasury interest rate at october  the interest rate pricing date  the company made a payment of million in settlement of the agreement in october the payment on the agreement is being amortized over years the life of the notes as a yield adjustment to interest expense 
we received investment grade corporate credit ratings from duff phelps rating company  moody s investor service  inc  and standard poor s rating group in december currently  duff phelps has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa  and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior debt 
these ratings could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
property acquisitions during  we continued to increase the size of the portfolio through a strategic program of real estate acquisitions 
we acquired additional properties the new properties  and selectively sold properties  increasing the number of properties in the portfolio by to properties at december  from properties at december  during  we invested million in new properties and properties under development excluding estimated unfunded development costs on properties under construction at december  of million 
the weighted average annual unleveraged return on the million invested page in is estimated to be  computed as estimated contractual net operating income which in the case of a net leased property is equal to the base rent or  in the case of properties under construction  the estimated base rent under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total costs 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  no assurance can be given that the actual return on the funds invested will not differ from the foregoing percentage 
the new properties are located in states  will contain approximately million leasable square feet and are leased under net leases  with an average initial lease term of years 
during  we also paid  for lease commissions and  for building improvements on existing properties in our portfolio 
of the new properties  were occupied as of march  and the remaining properties were pre leased and under construction pursuant to contracts under which the tenants or developers have agreed to develop the properties with development costs funded by the company and with the tenant to begin paying rent when the premises open for business 
during  we invested million in properties purchased in and properties under development excluding estimated unfunded development costs on properties under construction at december  
the weighted average annual unleveraged return on the million invested in is estimated to be  computed in the same manner as s estimated weighted average annual unleveraged return 
these properties purchased in are located in states  contain approximately million leasable square feet and are leased with an average initial lease term of years 
distributions cash distributions paid during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the cash distributions include a special distribution of million paid in january realty income pays distributions monthly 
the following is a summary of the monthly cash distributions for the years ended december   and  which totaled  and  respectively 
the january distributions include a special distribution of per share 
in december  january and february  we declared distributions of per share  which were paid on january   february  and payable on march   respectively 
the monthly distribution of per share represents a current annualized distribution of per share  and an annualized distribution yield of approximately based on the last reported sale price of the company s common stock on the nyse of on march  although the company expects to continue its policy of paying monthly distributions  there can be no assurance that the current level of distributions will be maintained by the company or as to the actual distribution yield for any future period 
page funds from operations ffo ffo for increased by million or to million versus million during ffo during was million 
we define ffo as net income before gain on sales of properties  plus provision for impairment losses  plus depreciation and amortization 
in accordance with the recommendations of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  amortization of deferred financing costs are not added back to net income to calculate ffo 
amortization of financing costs are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo and information regarding distributions paid and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for  and dollars in thousands net income    plus depreciation and amortization    plus provision for impairment losses less depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment and amortization of organization costs less gain on sales of properties   plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle total funds from operations    regular cash distributions paid    ffo in excess of regular distributions    special cash distributions paid  diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding    we consider ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo is used by financial analysts in evaluating reits and can be one measure of a reit s ability to make cash distribution payments 
presentation of this information provides the reader with an additional measure to compare the performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way so comparisons with such reits may not be meaningful 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of realty income s performance or to cash flows from operating  page investing  and financing activities as a measure of liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or to pay debt service

this method of identification could cause these programs to fail or create erroneous results in the year this situation has been referred to generally as the year issue 
we believe that the cost of remediation associated with our corporate level computer systems will be minimal less than 
we anticipate that we will complete remediation in the second quarter of the second essential component of the year issue is to ensure that our significant tenants are assessed for year compliance 
we have initiated discussions with our significant tenants in order to assess readiness for the year issue 
through march   tenants page representing approximately of our revenue have confirmed that they are year compliant or anticipate being compliant by the end of the second quarter of due to the nature of the tenant s businesses  we do not believe the year issue will materially impact the tenant s ability to pay rent 
however  the failure of one or more tenants as a result of the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
the third component of our year compliance plan is to ensure that our significant vendors are assessed for year compliance 
we have initiated discussions with these significant vendors in order to assess their ability to successfully resolve the year issue 
through march   of our significant vendors have confirmed that they are year compliant or anticipate being compliant by the end of the second quarter of our transfer agent has advised us it is year compliant 
upon completion of our assessment program  we will consider the necessity of implementing a contingency plan to mitigate any adverse effects associated with the year issue 
though we do not expect the year issue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position  there can be no assurances of that position 
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenant s sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in increases in rent over time 
however  during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
approximately of the properties in the portfolio are leased to tenants under net leases in which the tenant is responsible for property costs and expenses 
these features in the leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on the tenants if increases in the tenant s operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 

statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
statement no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after june  page we anticipate that the adoption of statement no 
will not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate lock agreements  interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in table in millions 
expected maturity data there fair after total value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate table million matures in and million matures in the fair value of the fixed rate debt is based upon the closing market price per note i at december  for the notes and ii december  date of the last trade made in for the notes 
the fair value of the variable rate debt approximates its carrying value because its terms are similar to those available in the market place 
as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
