financial condition and results of operations acquisition 
effective october   the company completed the acquisition of repap usa  inc  the holding company for repap wisconsin  inc 
and repap sales corporation  in kimberly  wisconsin 
the company renamed these operations inter lake papers  inc  inter lake wisconsin  inc 
and inter lake sales corp  respectively 
the operating results of the acquired companies subsequent to the acquisition date are included in the consolidated statements of income 
details of the acquisition are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales and cost of sales 
net sales increased to a record billion in  compared with net sales of billion and net sales of billion 
record shipments of  tons were an increase of over the previous record year of  which was a increase over gross margin as a percent of sales was  compared with in and in the lower margin was due primarily to periodic downtime related to the increase in lower priced imports and less than optimal product mix 
in  much of the increased domestic demand was absorbed by imports from foreign producers taking advantage of low labor rates  low raw material costs  lower currency exchange rates and trade protectionism 
lower priced imports were up in compared with the previous year 
for  margins were lower than in due to lower selling prices and less than optimal product mix 
plant operations 
shipments of coated and supercalendered printing papers increased in by 
groundwood free coated shipments primarily wisconsin rapids and converting divisions and inter lake papers increased in due to the october   acquisition of inter lake papers and continued productivity improvements on all paper machines 
this compares with a increase in due to near capacity operations and productivity improvements 
during  the wisconsin rapids division operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in the industry average capacity utilization for groundwood free grades was in  in and in on average  selling prices decreased in  following a decrease of in and a decrease in the converting division  which converts heavier weight groundwood free coated rolls into sheets  operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in groundwood coated shipments biron  wisconsin river and niagara divisions and inter lake papers increased in  following a increase in the facilities operated at of available capacity  compared with in and in the us industry average utilization for groundwood grades was in  in and in during  selling prices improved  following declines of in and in inter lake papers  inc manufactures a combination of groundwood free and groundwood coated papers 
this facility operated at of available capacity during  compared with of available capacity during the fourth quarter of lake superior paper industries  which makes supercalendered groundwood papers  operated at of available capacity in  compared with in and in shipments in decreased primarily due to the downtime associated with the machine rebuild in february this compares with a increase in selling prices improved in  compared with declines of in and in the stevens point division s coated specialty paper shipments increased in  compared with an increase of in and a decline of in the mill s newest paper machine  no 
 which increased the division s annual capacity from  tons to  tons  began operation during the first quarter of and exceeded management s expectations for quality and productivity 
due to the added capacity and weakened markets  the division operated at of available capacity for  compared with in and in selling prices decreased in  following declines of in and in superior recycled fiber industries operated at of available capacity in  compared with in and in reduced demand for recycled pulps resulted in continued selling price reductions of in  compared with a decline of in paperboard products shipments decreased  and corrugated products shipments decreased in the paperboard products and corrugated products businesses both operated in highly competitive markets and continued their marketing emphasis on producing high value added specialty products 
in october  consolidated announced that castle rock container company  manufacturer of corrugated products  is being offered for sale in keeping with the company s strategic commitment to focus on its core business 
a potential buyer has not been named 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million  compared with increases of million in and million in the increase resulted from general inflation increases and a full year of selling  general and administrative expenses for the october   acquisition of inter lake papers 
other income and income taxes 
other income expense was million in  million in and million in the increases in net other expense in and are due primarily to increases in interest expense related to higher debt associated with the october acquisition of inter lake papers and additional borrowings used for the early buyout of an operating lease at lake superior paper industries 
effective tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the higher rate in is due primarily to nondeductible goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources 
current account changes 
the october acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the assets and liabilities  which have been stated at their fair value  affect the comparison to prior periods 
accounts receivable in decreased by million  compared with an increase of million in  of which million represents inter lake papers  inc  and a decrease of million in the decrease was principally due to lower sales volume during the fourth quarter 
the days sales outstanding has not materially changed  and the company believes its collection period is well within the industry s standards 
inventories decreased million compared with  primarily due to lower raw material prices 
finished goods decreased million  raw materials decreased million and stores supplies decreased million  compared with increases of million for finished goods  million for raw materials and million for stores supplies in  all primarily due to the inter lake papers acquisition 
prepaid expenses increased million  primarily due to an increase in prepaid income taxes of million  compared with a decrease of million in  primarily due to the lake superior paper industries lease buyout  which resulted in the reclassification of a million prepaid lease expense to plant and equipment 
accounts payable decreased million in due to timings of payments  compared with an increase of million in due to inter lake papers 
payroll and employee benefits increased million  due primarily to a million increase in accrued employee retirement benefits in compared with an increase of million in due to inter lake papers 
the year end ratio of current assets to current liabilities was in  compared with in and in capital commitments and spending 
at the end of  authorized but uncompleted capital projects totaled million 
a capital approval budget of million is in place 
this million  plus the million carry over from  less anticipated carry over of million at the end of  is expected to result in planned capital spending of million in  compared with expenditures of million in  million in and million in the major expenditures included million for a lease buyout of a paper machine at lake superior paper industries  million for a paper machine rebuild project at the biron division  million for a hot soft supercalender addition at the stevens point division  million for a paper machine rebuild project at lake superior paper industries  million for new supercalenders at the niagara division  and million for a groundwood project at the niagara division 
the capital approval budget for million consists of million for necessary replacement and quality projects  million for high return projects  and million for environmental control projects 
included in the approval budget is million for new projects for the inter lake papers operation 
long term debt 
the company s borrowings at december   were billion  an increase of million  following increases of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase during resulted primarily from the completion of the exercise of the early purchase option to buy out the operating lease on machinery and equipment at lake superior paper industries 
in  the company paid million in cash and assumed million in debt to buy out the remaining four owner participants 
the first of five owner participants was bought out in december by paying million in cash and assuming million in debt 
the debt assumed in this transaction  a million face value term loan  was redeemed in and the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million  after taxes 
this consisted primarily of a prepayment penalty and costs associated with the early redemption  net of the remaining debt premium see note 
the redemption of this debt was financed with proceeds from million private placement notes  which were issued in with interest rates between and 
the company s borrowings increased million in the increase primarily resulted from the inter lake papers acquisition for million in cash and the assumption of million of debt  of which million of the face value was refinanced in december the financing for the acquisition including the december refinancing was provided from proceeds of a private placement of million of senior notes and proceeds under a new million revolving credit facility 
also in  the company completed the sale and leaseback of its no 
paper machine at the stevens point division 
the proceeds of million were used to pay down the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company has million available for further use under its million revolving credit facility 
the company also has unused lines of credit of approximately million 
such amounts  together with cash flow from future operations  are expected to be more than sufficient to fund projected capital commitments 
interest expense incurred totaled almost million in  with million charged against income and million capitalized as part of the cost of related capital projects 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company entered into sale and leaseback transactions for two paper machines during these leases are capital in nature  resulting in lease obligations of million at december  because deposits of million at december   are believed to be adequate for future lease payments  the company will not need to generate or borrow significant additional funds to make the required lease payments 
market risk 
in the ordinary course of business  consolidated papers  inc is exposed to market risk  primarily interest rate and currency exchange rate risks 
these exposures relate to changes in interest rates on outstanding debt and to the sale of products to foreign customers 
the company currently uses interest rate swap agreements to limit its exposure on a small portion of its long term debt 
the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are constant 
at december   the company s floating rate debt approximates fair market value 
a hypothetical change in the company s weighted average borrowing rate would cause a million change in earnings 
the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt was estimated to be million at december   and exceeded the carrying value by million 
market risk of million is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rate at december  foreign exchange rate risk 
the company s earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared with foreign currencies  predominately the canadian dollar  as a result of the sales of its products in foreign markets 
the company does not currently enter into any contracts in an attempt to hedge foreign currency risk 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a change in earnings of million 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are reflected in a changed us dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in this potential change in sales levels 
environmental matters 
the paper industry is subject to extensive environmental regulations  many of which require significant capital and operational expenditures 
the clean air act amendments of and the clean water act effluent guidelines limitations will have a significant financial impact on the paper industry 
the us environmental protection agency epa adopted rules in to reduce the industry s discharge of air and water pollutants and has proposed additional rules to further reduce industry emissions of hazardous air pollutants 
the additional proposed regulations addressing air pollutants are subject to further change prior to final promulgation  now expected in april these final and proposed regulations are commonly referred to as the cluster rule 
the company s review of the cluster rule indicates that capital expenditures of approximately million for process and equipment changes will be required in the next three years to achieve compliance 
in september  the epa finalized regulations addressing the formation and transport of ozone across state boundaries in the eastern half of the united states 
the regulations require states including wisconsin to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides  a precursor to ozone formation 
depending upon wisconsin s implementation plan  due in  the company may incur significant capital costs to install additional controls on its power and recovery boilers 
both the cluster rule and the ozone transport regulations are being challenged in various lawsuits brought by industry  environmental groups and other interested parties 
the outcome of this litigation may significantly affect the company s analysis of potential regulatory costs 
other statutory and regulatory environmental initiatives now under consideration could have a material impact on the pulp and paper industry 
these initiatives include mandated reductions in greenhouse gases by energy intensive industries and efforts to further reduce access to fiber sources 
the company continues to closely follow sediment remediation activities under way on various watershed systems  including the fox river and wisconsin river 
on the fox river  state and federal agencies have focused on study and remediation of sediments containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  which are believed to have been discharged by companies that manufactured or recycled carbonless papers in the s and early s 
neither the company s former appleton division  closed in  nor the inter lake papers facility  acquired in  was involved in carbonless paper manufacture or recycling 
however  it is likely that the existing potentially responsible parties on the fox river will seek contributions from the company and others if litigation is initiated 
on the wisconsin river  the wisconsin department of natural resources has prepared a comprehensive management plan cmp that addresses a variety of environmental issues relating to the petenwell and castle rock flowages  including sediment contamination and water quality 
these flowages are artificial impoundments created by dams downstream of the company s operations 
the cmp calls for further environmental studies of the flowages  but contains no mandatory timetables or overall funding mechanism for any remediation activities that may ultimately be required 
management believes that the resolution of existing environmental matters will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
year general 
the company s year efforts are continuing  with completion of the final stages of its internal compliance project scheduled for august the company has defined two major areas for its internal efforts business applications and process applications all other hardware and software systems 
the company has defined a nine step process toward year compliance planning and awareness  inventory  triage assess risks and prioritize efforts  detailed assessment identify where failures may occur  determine solutions and plans to repair or replace  resolution repair  retire or replace noncompliant systems  create bridges to other systems and perform unit testing  test planning  test execution  deployment of compliant systems  and fallout remove bridges and patches  recertify standards 
in both business and process applications  planning and awareness  inventory  triage  and detailed assessment are substantially complete 
work continues in the remaining areas 
the company s overall year project was complete at the end of in addition to its internal efforts  the company s year team is also focusing on external factors that may affect the company  including the compliancy status of suppliers and customers 
the external effort includes the development of contingency plans to address identified risks 
business applications 
this area includes in house developed applications  purchased software systems and all hardware required for business application 
assessment in this area is substantially complete  and the year team is now developing and executing remediation plans for noncompliant purchased software and hardware devices 
business applications are on schedule for completion of system testing and deployment by august process applications 
this area includes the company s manufacturing operations  where many items such as machine drives  scanners and process control devices include date dependent features 
assessment of these devices has generally been completed  although some vendors have been slow to respond to the company s inquiries 
remediation and testing of process applications  which must be coordinated with scheduled mill downtime  are planned for completion in august costs 
the total cost associated with the hardware and software modifications required by the year problem is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the company presently estimates that it will spend approximately million on its overall year project 
this includes million for remediation and replacement of noncompliant systems  million for outside consultant costs  and million for internal labor costs 
the amount expected to be spent on remediation and replacement includes previously budgeted items totaling million  where these expenditures have been accelerated to meet year requirements 
of the overall million cost  approximately million had been spent at the end of external factors customers and suppliers 
the company has surveyed its customers and suppliers in an effort to determine and assess those parties year compliance status 
these groups have been prioritized based on their relative importance to the company s operations 
the company is focusing its efforts with suppliers on those parties whose failure to be year compliant could significantly affect the company s ability to do business 
prioritization also includes an analysis of alternative sources of raw materials or production equipment 
the company is also engaged in an ongoing dialogue with major customers 
most key customers and suppliers appear to be making good progress toward year compliance 
the company s efforts to determine its suppliers and customers year status will continue throughout as it monitors the progress of those parties ongoing year efforts 
contingency plans 
the company believes that its internal compliance efforts will prevent any material disruption of the company s business and process applications caused by the year problem 
current external efforts are identifying certain potential risks  such as shutdown of key customers or suppliers  breakdowns in transportation systems  or failures of the electrical grid or the company s wide area network 
contingency plans are being developed to address these problems where possible 
the company is in the early stages of developing contingency plans with respect to suppliers 
these plans will involve identification of alternative supply sources and may consider increased inventories of raw materials and finished product 
identification of alternative supply sources may prove difficult in some areas  particularly with respect to existing assets that require repair  upgrade or replacement parts from the original vendor 
the company expects to increase its focus on contingency planning in the first quarter of should problems arise that disrupt key suppliers operations or prevent customers from purchasing or using the company s products  the company would likely take manufacturing downtime and other steps designed to minimize costs 
at this time  the company cannot predict the likelihood of a significant disruption of its customers or suppliers businesses or of the economy as a whole  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company 
however  these potential problems are similar to those generally faced by other manufacturers 
forward looking statements 
certain statements in management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in the company s annual report to shareholders may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of because these forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  actual future results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ include  among other things increased competition from either domestic or foreign paper producers  including increases in competitive capacity through construction of new mills or conversion of older facilities to produce competitive products  variations in demand for the company s products  changes in the cost or availability of the raw materials used by the company  particularly market pulp and wood  costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations  decisions by the company to make a significant acquisition or a significant increase in production capacity  and unanticipated costs or problems associated with year compliance
