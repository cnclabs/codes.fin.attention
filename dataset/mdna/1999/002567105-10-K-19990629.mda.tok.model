item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview abaxis  inc the company develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
the company s products consist of a compact kilogram analyzer and a series of single use plastic disks called reagent discs that contain all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests 
the system can be operated with minimal training and performs multiple routine tests on whole blood  serum or plasma using either venous or fingerstick samples 
the system provides test results in less than minutes with the precision and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory 
the company currently markets this system for veterinary use under the name vetscan and in the human medical market under the name piccolo 
in fiscal  the company s us revenues accounted for of its total revenues versus in fiscal  international revenues accounted for versus in fiscal the decline in the share of the international revenue is due to a decline in the asian market  in particular japan 
the asian market declined to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal the company does not expect the asian market to recover to previous levels in the near future or at all 
during the year ended march   the company placed point of care blood chemistry analyzers worldwide a decrease from fiscal shipments of  point of care blood chemistry analyzers 
the decline in instrument sales reflects lower unit shipments to japan and the us military 
the company does not expect instrument unit sales to japan to recover in the near future  if at all 
shipments to the military declined due to the completion of a contract with the us navy 
the company does not expect sales to the us military to increase unless an additional contract is completed  if at all 
reagent discs shipped during fiscal were approximately  an increase of compared to fiscal shipments of approximately  reagent discs 
most of these reagent disc shipments were for veterinary applications 
the increase in reagent disc shipments during fiscal is consistent with the company s belief that there will be recurring reagent disc revenue as the company s product lines mature 
this growth is mostly attributable to the expanded installed base of vetscan systems and higher consumption rates of institutional users 
there can be no assurance growth in revenues or unit sales will continue or that the company will be able to increase production to meet increased product demand 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
the company generally operates with limited order backlog because its products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
the company s expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues 
accordingly the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would have an immediate materially adverse impact on operating results and financial condition 
until sales volume of the company s products  particularly its reagent discs  increases significantly so as to offset associated fixed costs and to realize certain manufacturing economies of scale  sales of the company s products will result in further losses and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that it needs to complete the development and obtain approval for the four electrolyte disc in order to make a significant impact in the human medical market 
the company is currently preparing a submission to the fda for potassium and co sodium is currently in clinical trials and chloride is in research and development 
there is no assurance that the products will be successfully developed or that the fda will approve the marketing application 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
there has been little or no impact on the company s business due to changing prices 
the company s periodic operating results have in the past varied and in the future may vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including the level of competition  the size and timing of sales orders  market acceptance of current and new products  new product announcements by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  component costs and supply constraints  manufacturing capacities and ability to scale up production  the mix of product sales between the analyzers and the reagent discs  mix in sales channels  levels of expenditure on research and development  changes in company strategy  personnel changes  regulatory changes  and general economic trends 
the company continues to explore the application of its proprietary technology used to produce the dry reagents used in the reagent discs  called the orbos discrete lyophilization process  to other companies products 
this process allows the production of an accurate  precise amount of active chemical ingredients in the form of a soluble bead 
the company believes that the orbos process has broad applications in products where delivery of active ingredients in a stable  pre metered format is desired 
the company has contracts with becton dickinson immunocytometry systems and pharmacia biotech  inc to either supply products or license orbos technology 
the company is currently working with other companies to determine potential suitability of the orbos technology to these companies products 
as resources permit  the company will pursue other development  licensing or manufacturing agreement opportunities for its orbos technology with other companies 
there can be no assurances  however  that other applications will be identified or that additional agreements with the company will result 
results of operations revenue during fiscal  the company reported total revenues of approximately  a  or increase from fiscal total revenues of approximately  during fiscal  the company reported total revenues of approximately  a  or increase from fiscal total revenues of approximately  revenue increases in fiscal compared to fiscal were due to increased unit sales of vetscan systems and reagent discs in the us and europe 
total revenue in the us for fiscal was approximately  a  or increase from fiscal of approximately  total revenue in europe for fiscal was approximately  a  or increase from fiscal of approximately  total revenue in asia and latin america was approximately  a  or decline from fiscal of approximately  the decline in asia and latin america was due to unfavorable currency and economic conditions 
the company does not expect revenues from asia and latin america to recover in fiscal year  if ever 
the company expects to shift sales and marketing resources from the asian and latin american markets to the us and european markets 
total revenue in the us for fiscal was approximately  a  or increase from fiscal of approximately  total revenue in europe for fiscal was approximately  a  or increase from fiscal of approximately  total revenue in asia and latin america in fiscal was approximately  a  or increase from fiscal of approximately in fiscal year  one customer accounted for of total revenue 
three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  cost of product sales cost of product sales during the year ended march  was approximately  or of total revenues  as compared to approximately  or of total revenues in fiscal year in fiscal year cost of product sales was approximately  or of total revenues 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percent of revenue for the year ending march  as compared to the same periods ending march  and was primarily a function of the increase in sales volume of reagent discs and lower unit costs resulting from improved manufacturing processes 
the decrease in cost of product sales as a percentage of total revenues comparing fiscal to is due to lower unit costs resulting from better standardized manufacturing processes and economies of scale related to increased manufacturing volume 
research and development expense the company incurred research and development expenses of approximately  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal the  or increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of increased spending in the development of new test methods  in particular the new critical care profile disk the company launched in march the  or increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of increased spending in the development of new test methods offset by reallocation of a portion of the company s development resources to support product manufacturing activities such as manufacturing process development 
research and development activities accounted for of product revenue during fiscal as compared to of product revenue during fiscal and during fiscal the company expects the dollar amount of research and development expenses to increase in fiscal from fiscal but decline as a percentage of product revenue  as the company completes development and clinical trials of new test methods to expand its test menus as well as other development projects 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will undertake such research and development activities in future periods or  if it does  that such activities will be successful 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately  or of total revenue in fiscal compared to  or of total revenues in fiscal  and approximately  or of total revenues in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal is primarily the result of launching new products and an increase in headcount 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal of  or is primarily the result of certain non recurring costs associated with the launch of the piccolo product line in fiscal and the company s cost containment efforts in fiscal the company expects the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense to increase in fiscal from fiscal but decline as a percent of product revenue  to meet staffing and support demands associated with increased sales 
net interest and other income expense net interest and other income expense totaled approximately  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal  and  in fiscal the company incurred interest expense of approximately  on an equipment loan and a working capital loan during fiscal  net of capitalized interest of approximately  on the purchase and installation of the new automated disk production line 
the company incurred interest expense of approximately  on an equipment loan during fiscal the company incurred no interest expense during fiscal the company expects interest expense to increase in fiscal to meet working capital requirements associated with an increase in sales 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs to support its future operations  including further commercialization of its products and development of new test methods that will allow the company to further penetrate the human diagnostic market  acquisition of capital equipment for the company s manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing costs related to continuing development of its current and future products  development and implementation of an automated manufacturing line to provide capacity for commercial volumes  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for its current and future products 
net cash used in operating activities during fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and  net cash used in operating activities during fiscal the increase in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in trade receivables and inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued payroll and related expenses 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a lower net loss  a decrease in inventories and increases in trade and other receivables  accounts payable  and accrued payroll and other accrued liabilities 
net inventories at march   compared to march   were higher due to preparation for shipment against orders from the navy and vetsmart contracts beginning in april increases in trade and other receivables and accounts payable is due to increases in receivable and payable levels associated with revenue growth 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was  as compared to net cash used of  for fiscal compared to  net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal the change from net cash used in fiscal to net cash provided in was due primarily to maturities of available for sale securities in fiscal the change from net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal to net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in purchases of short term investments offset by a decrease in the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal cash provided by financing activities for fiscal is primarily the result of net proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of  net proceeds of borrowings under a line of credit and net proceeds from equipment financing of  cash provided by financing activities for fiscal is primarily the result of net proceeds from issuance of common and preferred stock of  and net proceeds from equipment financing of  cash provided by financing activities for fiscal is primarily the result of net proceeds from issuance of common and preferred stock of  cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was decreased by a  payment of a preferred stock dividend 
the company currently has  available under the line of credit 
this line of credit expires in august and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend the line of credit for another year 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  debt financing and anticipated revenue from the sales of its products will be adequate to satisfy its currently planned operating and financial requirements through the next twelve months 
the company s future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of its point of care blood chemistry analyzer products 
however  the company s sales are not predictable due to its limited market experience with its products 
in the event the sales are significantly below the anticipated level  the company may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all  and any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  while debt financing may involve restrictive covenants 
year preparedness the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written with two digits rather than four to signify a year ie  the year is denoted as and not 
computer programs written using only two digits may recognize the year as the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations 
readiness the company has identified the following areas where efforts are underway to resolve year issues i internal information technology it systems  ii the piccolo and vetscan instruments the company markets  iii test equipment used in research and development  and iv third party vendors and distributors who do business with the company 
the company has upgraded the internal it systems to the vendor s specifications for year compliance 
the it systems will be tested during the second and third quarters of fiscal to determine that the it systems are working within the specifications 
the company s piccolo and vetscan systems were designed for year compliance 
tests have been completed on the systems that confirm year compliance 
the company intends to address year issues regarding its test equipment used in research and development and third party vendors who do business with the company in the second and third quarters of fiscal costs aggregate costs for year efforts in fiscal and currently are anticipated to be less than  including approximately  expensed in the year ended march  and for the year preparedness since inception for software and consulting services 
the remaining estimated costs for year issues are expected to be consulting services  which will be expensed in the period they occur 
risks the company is presently unable to assess the likelihood that the company will experience significant operational problems due to unresolved year problems of third parties that do business with the company 
there can be no assurance that other entities will achieve timely year compliance  if they do not  year problems could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
contingency plans the company presently believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario that the company might confront with respect to year issues has to do with failure at one or more of the company s distributors over which the company has no control 
for example  if one or more of the company s distributors were unable to ship product to the end user  the company would have to take orders and ship direct to the end user customers 
there are policies and procedures in place for direct shipments to the end user as the company currently ships product directly to some national accounts 
should this worst case scenario occur  the company would have to increase headcount in a number of operating areas  such as customer service  shipping and accounting 
there can be no assurance that the company can increase the operating capacity in a timely manner and there can be no assurance that these additional operating expenses would not have a material adverse financial impact on the company 
risk factors the future events that we describe in these risk factors involve risks and uncertainties 
among them are risks and uncertainties related to the market acceptance of our products  our continuing development of our products  obtaining required food and drug administration clearance and other federal  state and local government approvals  the manufacture and distribution of our products on a commercial scale  general market conditions  and competition 
when used in these risk factors  the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  plans  future  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those that we project in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that we have set forth throughout this document as well as factors of which we are currently not aware 
we are not profitable  we must increase sales of our piccolo and vetscan products to be profitable as of march   we have not been profitable in any period since our formation in  and we had incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we expect our losses to continue through at least fiscal year our ability to become profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase our sales volumes of our vetscan and piccolo products 
increasing our sales volume of our products will depend upon our ability to continue to develop our products  increase our sales and marketing activities  increase our manufacturing activities  and effectively compete against current and future competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully increase our sales volumes of our products to achieve profitability 
we are not able to predict sales in future quarters and a number of factors affect our periodic results we are not able to accurately predict our sales in future quarters 
in any quarter  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to a limited number of distributors who resell our products to the ultimate user 
while we are better able to predict sales of our reagent discs  as we sell these discs primarily for use with analyzers that we sold in prior periods  we generally are unable to predict with much certainty sales of our analyzers  as we typically sell our analyzers to new users 
accordingly  our sales in any one quarter are not indicative of our sales in any future period 
in addition  we generally operate with limited order backlog  because we ship our products shortly after we receive the orders from our customers 
as a result  our product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders that we receive and ship in that quarter 
we base our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  in part on our expectations as to future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would immediately materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we have historically experienced a decrease in our sales  especially in europe  in our second and third quarters 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
our periodic operating results have varied in the past 
in the future  we expect our periodic operating results to vary significantly depending on  but not limited to  a number of factors  including the level of competition in the markets in which we compete  the size and timing of sales orders that we receive from our customers  market acceptance of our current and future products  new product announcements made by us or our competitors  changes in our pricing structures or the pricing structures of our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  the costs  and possible supply constraints  of the components that we use to build our products  our manufacturing capacities and our ability to increase the scale of these capacities  the mix of product sales between our analyzer and our reagent disc products  the different sales channels available to us  the limited size of our sales force  the amount we spend on research and development  changes in our strategy  changes in our key personnel  changes in regulatory matters  and general economic trends in the economy 
we may need additional funding in the future and these funds may not be available to us we believe that our existing capital resources  bank and equipment financing loans and anticipated revenue from the sales of our products will be adequate to satisfy our currently planned operating and financial requirements through fiscal year  although no assurances can be given 
we will need additional funds  however  if we do not achieve anticipated revenues  from the sale of our piccolo and vetscan products 
in addition  we expect to incur substantial additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods to allow us to further penetrate the human diagnostic market and the veterinary diagnostic market  our need to acquire capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing development and implementation of automated manufacturing lines to provide capacity for the production of commercial volumes of our products  research and design costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
to the extent that our existing resources and anticipated revenue from the sale of the piccolo and vetscan systems are insufficient to fund our activities  we will have to raise additional funds from the issuance of public or private securities 
we may not be able to raise additional funding  or if we are able to  we may not be able to raise funding on acceptable terms 
we may dilute then existing shareholders if we raise additional funds by issuing new equity securities 
alternatively  we may have to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products and or sales territories if we are required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to raise needed funds  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we have limited marketing and distribution experience and few resources to devote to marketing and distribution  our international sales efforts are characterized by a high degree of distributor turnover we have been marketing our vetscan system products for less than four years in the veterinary diagnostic market  and we have only recently begun marketing our piccolo system products in the human diagnostic market 
accordingly  we have very limited marketing and distribution experience  especially in the human diagnostic market 
further  we have limited resources to devote to marketing and distribution 
in particular  we have only eleven full time sales personnel involved in our sales and marketing activities 
while these individuals work with our distribution partners both domestically and internationally to extend our market reach  the primary selling activities are often done by these individuals 
if we are to increase our sales  we will need to increase the size of our sales force 
however  we may be constrained from growing our sales force by our financial resources and the availability of qualified sales personnel 
this means that we may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization  or we may not be able to establish an extensive and effective distribution network 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build a successful sales and marketing organization  we will be able to establish effective distribution arrangements  any distribution arrangements that we are able to establish will be successful in marketing our products  or the costs associated with marketing and distributing our products will not be excessive 
although we have established some international distributors  we have limited experience and resources in marketing and distributing our products in international markets 
moreover  we have experienced a high degree of turnover among our international distributors 
this high degree of turnover makes it difficult for us to establish a steady distribution network overseas 
consequently  we may not be successful in marketing our piccolo system and vetscan system products internationally 
we need to develop additional reagent discs for the human diagnostic market if we are to compete in that market we have developed a blood analysis system that consists of a portable blood analyzer and single use reagent discs 
each reagent disc performs a series of standard blood tests 
we believe that it is necessary to develop additional series of reagent discs with various tests for use with the piccolo and vetscan systems 
currently  we have primarily developed reagent discs suitable for the veterinary diagnostic market 
in order to be competitive in the more lucrative human diagnostic market  we need to develop additional reagent discs that include certain standard tests for which the medical community receives reimbursements from third party payors such as hmos and medicare 
the tests that we need to develop to compete in the human diagnostic market include the standard electrolyte tests potassium  sodium  chloride and carbon dioxide and lipid tests 
currently  we are in clinical testing for the potassium  sodium and carbon dioxide tests  but we are still developing the chloride and lipid tests 
we may not be able to develop these new reagent discs on a timely and cost effective basis 
also  we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance for these new reagent discs 
further  even if we gain regulatory approval  we may not be able to successfully manufacture or market the reagent discs 
our failure to meet one or more of these challenges will materially adversely effect our operating results and financial condition 
we rely on distributors to sell our products  we rely on sole distributor arrangements in a number of countries we distribute our products primarily through distributors 
as a result  we are dependent upon these distributors to sell our products and to assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products 
we have a number of distributors in the united states who distribute our vetscan products  although one of these distributors has accounted for a majority of our sales in the united states to date 
we believe that our future growth depends on the efforts of these distributors 
if one of our distributors were to stop selling our products  we may not be able to replace it 
further  many of our distributors may carry our competitors products  and may promote our competitors products over our own products 
finally  we do not have at this time distribution partners in the united states who distribute our products for the human diagnostic market 
we currently have exclusive distribution agreements in the following countries argentina  australia  austria  france  germany  greece  hong kong  italy  japan  korea  mexico  new zealand  norway  portugal  spain  switzerland  turkey  and the united kingdom 
our distributor in each of these countries is responsible for obtaining the necessary approvals to sell our products 
these distributors may not be successful in obtaining proper approvals for our products in their respective countries  and they may not be successful in marketing our products 
we plan to enter into additional distribution agreements to expand our international distribution base and solidify our international presence 
however  we may not be successful in entering into additional distributor agreements 
our distributors may  and have in the past  terminate their relationship with us at any time 
if that happens  we may not be able to negotiate acceptable alternative distribution relationships 
our manufacturing capacity is limited and we may not be able to expand it we have limited manufacturing capacity 
because our products are highly complex  it is difficult for us to manufacture them through an assembly line process 
while we believe that the autoline assembly system that we are installing will be adequate for our current needs  we may not be able to increase the scale of the autoline system to handle either larger volume production or the production of new or varied products 
further  all aspects of such a scale up must comply with applicable governmental regulations 
we may encounter significant delays or incur unforeseen costs in expanding our manufacturing capacity because of the complexities described above 
in addition  we will need to continue to develop the infrastructure that we require to effectively manage our manufacturing operations 
the process of manufacturing sufficient quantities of our products can be expensive  time consuming and complex 
we may not be able to successfully add technical and non technical personnel that we need to meet the additional staffing requirements that any increase in production would require 
if we are unable to develop such increased manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure with appropriate quality  at acceptable costs and on a timely basis  our business or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on sole suppliers for several key components to our products we use several components that are currently available from limited or sole sources 
a single injection molding manufacturer currently makes the molded plastic discs which  when loaded with reagents and welded together  form our reagent disc products 
we believe that only a few manufacturers are capable of producing these discs to the narrow tolerances that we require  to date  we have only qualified one manufacturer to manufacture the molded plastic discs 
moreover  we currently depend on a single vendor for some of the chemicals that we use to produce the dry reagent chemistry beads 
further  our analyzer products use several technologically advanced components that are each available only from single vendors 
because we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for critical components to our products  we are particularly susceptible to any interruption in the supply of these products or the viability of our assembly arrangements 
the loss of one of these suppliers or a disruption in our manufacturing arrangements would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
competition from larger  better established entities such as hospitals and commercial laboratories blood analysis is a well established field in which there are a number of competitors that have substantially greater financial resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and service organizations than we do 
we compete with the following organizations commercial clinical laboratories  hospitals clinical laboratories  and manufacturers of bench top multi test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on site 
we may not be able to compete with these organizations or their products or with future organizations or future products 
historically  hospitals and commercial laboratories perform the most human medical testing  and commercial laboratories perform the most veterinary medical testing 
our products compete with the commercial and hospital laboratories with respect to range of tests offered  the immediacy of results  cost effectiveness  ease of use  and reliability of results 
we believe that we compete effectively on each of these factors except for the range of tests offered 
clinical laboratories are effective at processing large panels of tests using skilled technicians and complex equipment 
while our current offering of reagent discs cannot provide the same range of tests  we believe that our products provide a sufficient breadth of test menus to compete successfully with clinical laboratories  in certain limited markets  on the basis of the other four factors 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete effectively on cost effectiveness  ease of use  immediacy of results or reliability of results 
we also cannot assure you that we will ever be able to compete effectively on the basis of range of tests offered 
competition in the human and veterinary diagnostic markets is intense 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in particular  many of our competitors have large sales forces and well established distribution channels 
consequently  we must develop our distribution channels and improve our direct sales force in order to compete in these markets 
changes in third party payor reimbursement regulations can negatively affect our business by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for blood testing services  third party payors  such as hmos  pay per service insurance plans  medicare and medicaid  can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our human testing products 
for example  the health care financing administration sets the level of reimbursement of fees for blood testing services for medicare beneficiaries 
if third party payors decrease the reimbursement amounts for blood testing services  it may decrease the amount that physicians and hospitals are able to charge patients for such services 
consequently  we will need to charge less for our products 
if the government and third party payors do not provide for adequate coverage and reimbursement levels to allow health care providers to use our products  the demand for our products will decrease 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations need for fda certification for our medical device products 
our piccolo products are regulated under the medical device amendments to the food  drug and cosmetic act  which is administered by the food and drug administration 
the fda classified our initial piccolo products as class ii devices 
class ii devices require us to submit to the fda a pre market notification form or k 
the fda uses the k to substantiate product claims that are made by medical device manufacturers prior to marketing 
in our k notification  we must  among other things  establish that the product we plan to market is substantially equivalent to a product that was on the market prior to the adoption of the medical device amendment or to a product that the fda has previously cleared under the k process 
the fda review process of a k notification can last anywhere from three months to over a year  and the fda must issue a written order finding substantial equivalence before a company can market a medical device 
to date  we have received market clearance from the fda for our piccolo system and reagent tests that we have on four reagent discs 
we are currently developing additional tests that the fda will have to clear through the k notification procedures 
these new test products are crucial for our success in the human diagnostic market 
if we do not receive k clearance for a particular product  we will not be able to sell that product in the united states 
need to comply with manufacturing regulations the medical device amendment also requires us to manufacture our piccolo products in accordance with good manufacturing practices guidelines 
current good manufacturing practice requirements are set forth in the quality system regulation 
these requirements regulate the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  storage  installation and servicing of our medical devices intended for human use 
our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic audits 
in addition  various state regulatory agencies may regulate the manufacture of our products 
for example  we have obtained a license from the state of california to manufacture our products 
in september  the fda granted our manufacturing facility in compliance status  based on the regulations for good manufacturing practices for medical devices 
we are scheduled for inspection by the fda and the state of california on a routine basis  typically once every months 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully pass a re inspection by the fda or the state of california 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we can comply with all current or future government manufacturing requirements and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the regulations  or if we do not pass routine inspections  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
effects of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments on our products 
our piccolo products are affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments are intended to insure the quality and reliability of all medical testing in the united states regardless of where tests are performed 
the current clinical laboratory improvement amendments divide laboratory tests into three categories simple  moderately complex and highly complex 
tests performed using the piccolo system are in the moderately complex category 
this category requires that any location in which testing is performed be certified as a laboratory 
hence  we can only sell our piccolo products to customers who meet the standards of a laboratory 
to receive laboratory certification  a testing facility must be certified by the health care financing administration 
after the testing facility receives a laboratory certification  it must then meet the clinical laboratory improvement amendments regulations 
because we can only sell our piccolo products to testing facilities that are certified laboratories  the market for our products is correspondingly constrained 
in an effort to expand the market for our piccolo products  we have filed an application to have our piccolo products exempted from the clinical laboratory improvement amendments 
if our exemption request is denied  we will continue to be subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments 
consequently  the market for our piccolo products will be confined to those testing facilities that are certified as laboratories and our growth will be limited accordingly 
we are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
federal and state regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of health care products and diagnostic devices may change 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes would have on our business 
in addition  as we continue to sell in foreign markets  we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances for our products in the united states or in foreign markets  and the failure to obtain these regulatory clearances will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with all applicable regulations of the food and drug administration and of the state of california  including quality system regulations  current regulations depend on administrative interpretations 
future interpretations made by the food and drug administration  the health care finance administration or other regulatory bodies may adversely affect our business 
we rely on patents and other proprietary information  the loss of any of which would negatively affect our business as of march   we have filed patent applications in the united states and have been issued patents 
additionally  we have filed several international patent applications covering the same subject matter as our domestic applications 
the patent position of any medical device manufacturer  including abaxis  is uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual issues 
consequently  we may not be issued any additional patents  either domestically or internationally 
furthermore  our patents may not provide significant proprietary protection because there is a chance that they will be circumvented or invalidated 
we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications  or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  because the united states patent and trademark office maintains all patent applications in secrecy until it issues the patents and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tend to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
in addition  we may need to license or circumvent certain patents to produce our products 
moreover  we may have to participate in interference proceedings  which are proceeding in front of the us patent and trademark office  to determine who will be issued a patent 
these proceedings could be costly and could be decided against us 
although we have not had infringement claims filed against us to date  we may in the future be sued by third parties who claim that our products violate their intellectual property rights 
we may not be successful in defending ourselves against such claims 
even if we are successful  the defense of such claims would be expensive and would divert management s focus away from running our business 
consequently  any infringement claim  even if without merit  could adversely affect our business

furthermore  in order to be successful  we must recruit and retain additional qualified marketing  sales and manufacturing personnel

we believe that this insurance is adequate for our needs  taking into account the risks involved and cost of coverage 
however  our product liability insurance may be insufficient to cover potential liabilities

in particular  we are subject to laws  rules and regulations governing the handling and disposal of biohazardous materials used in the development and testing of our products 
although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations if our manufacturing to commercial levels continues to increase 
in addition  if a government agency determines that we have not complied with these laws  rules and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines and or take remedial action that would be expensive
