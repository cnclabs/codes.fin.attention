land and construction costs were higher as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased material costs and increased costs in the company s newer markets resulting from construction costs generally being higher as a percentage of selling price  and the relatively less efficient construction and construction related activities  in these markets 
although the company became more efficient in its newer markets during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  the increase in revenues from these markets as a percentage of total revenues resulted in an increase in the overall percentage of land and construction costs as a percentage of revenues 
these increases were partially offset by decreased land and land development costs and decreased overhead costs

the cost increases were partially offset by the lower amount of inventory writedowns recognized in million as compared to million 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to revenues increasing in at a faster pace than sg a spending 
the increase in spending was primarily attributable to the company s geographic expansion and the increase in the number of communities that it was operating in as compared to interest expense interest expense is determined on a specific lot by lot basis and will vary depending on many factors including the period of time that the land under the home was owned  the length of time that the house was under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by the company in proportion to the amount of its inventory during those periods 
income taxes income taxes for fiscal   and were provided at effective rates of   and  respectively 
extraordinary loss from extinguishment of debt in february  the company entered into a new five year  million bank credit facility 
in connection therewith  the company repaid million of fixed rate long term bank loans 
the company recognized an extraordinary charge in the second quarter of of  net of  of income tax benefit  related to the retirement of its previous revolving credit agreement and prepayment of the term loans 
in january  the company called for redemption in march of all its outstanding senior subordinated notes due at of principal amount plus accrued interest 
the redemption resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of  of income tax benefit 
capital resources and liquidity funding for the company s residential development activities is principally provided by cash flows from operations  unsecured bank borrowings and  from time to time  the public debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  has improved as operating results improved 
the company anticipates that the cash flow from operations will continue to improve as a result of an increase in revenues from the delivery of homes from the existing backlog as well as from new sales contracts 
the company has used the cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and public debt to acquire additional land for new communities  to fund additional expenditures for land development and construction costs needed to meet the requirements of the increased backlog and continuing expansion of the number of communities in which the company is offering homes for sale and to reduce debt 
the company expects that inventories will continue to increase and is currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility with fourteen banks which extends through february in december  the revolving credit facility was increased to million 
as of october   the company had million of loans and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
the company believes that it will be able to fund its activities through a combination of existing cash reserves  operating cash flow and existing sources of credit 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land  land development  construction and overhead costs  as well as in increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home 
year readiness disclosure the company has assessed and is continuing to assess its operating systems  computer software applications  computer equipment and other equipment with embedded electronic circuits programs that it currently uses to identify whether they are year compliant and  if not  what steps are needed to bring them into compliance 
the company expects that almost all programs will be year compliant by the end of the first quarter of calendar for those programs that will not be compliant by then  the company is reviewing the potential impact on the company and the alternatives that are available to it if the programs cannot be brought into compliance by december  the company believes that the required changes to its programs will be made on a timely basis without causing material operational issues or having a material impact on its results of operations or its financial position 
the company believes that its core business of homebuilding is not heavily dependent on the year compliance of its programs and that  should a reasonably likely worst case year situation occur  the company  because of the basic nature of its systems  many of which can be executed manually  would not likely suffer material loss or disruption in remedying the situation 
the costs incurred and expected to be incurred in the future regarding year compliance have been and are expected to be immaterial to the results of operation and financial position of the company 
costs related to year compliance are expensed 
the company has been reviewing whether its significant subcontractors  suppliers  financial institutions and other service providers providers are year compliant 
the company is not aware of any providers that do not expect to be compliant  however  the company has no means of ensuring that its providers will be year ready 
the inability of providers to be year ready in a timely fashion could have an adverse impact on the company 
the company plans to respond to any such contingency involving any of its providers by seeking to utilize alternative sources for such goods and services  where practicable 
in addition  widespread disruptions in the national or international economy  including  for example  disruptions affecting financial markets  commercial and investment banks  governmental agencies and utility services  such as heat  lights  power and telephones  could also have an adverse impact on the company 
the likelihood and effects of such disruptions are not determinable at this time
