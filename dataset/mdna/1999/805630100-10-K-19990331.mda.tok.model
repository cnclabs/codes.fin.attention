the net proceeds of approximately million were used as follows i million to repay indebtedness  of which million represented indebtedness to the company s principal stockholders and million represented indebtedness to other related parties  ii million to acquire land for future development  iii million to acquire the interests of various third party partners in certain properties and iv approximately  for development activities and general corporate purposes 
concurrently with the closing of the offering  the contributing stockholders contributed their partnership interests in certain properties to the company 
in addition  certain obligations to the contributing stockholders represented by the notes were satisfied as follows i approximately  of outstanding amounts due to the company by the principal stockholders were offset against the notes  ii million was repaid through the issuance by the company of  shares of common stock and iii million was repaid through the issuance by the company of warrants for  shares of common stock 
the warrants were exercisable at per share if the company achieved specified levels of after tax net income in and the actual level of after tax net income in was below the specified level and therefore the warrants lapsed 
the company has historically relied upon land and project financing  as applicable  partner and joint venture contributions in the form of land or cash  developer s equity value in excess of cost  other forms of debt  including loans from affiliates  and cash flow from operations to provide capital for land acquisitions and portfolio construction 
the company intends to continue to provide for its capital requirements from some or all of these sources 
management believes that cash generated from operations  funds available from external sources of debt and equity financing  together with cash on hand at december  will be sufficient to provide for its capital requirements for at least the next months 
the company is exploring the refinancing of these and other indebtedness through the issuance of up to million of longer term notes during there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
during the fourth quarter of  the company s president and principal stockholder  james c 
saxton  pledged  shares of common stock  or approximately of its outstanding shares  as collateral for two personal loans to mr 
saxton 
mr 
saxton reloaned the proceeds from such loans to the company for use in connection with the acquisition of diamond key 
the two notes payable to mr 
saxton aggregating  bear interest at per annum and mature on august  the company intends to refinance the loans from mr 
saxton prior to their maturities 
the company understands that mr 
saxton intends to repay  in full  the loans from the two lenders upon repayment of the loans he has made to the company 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to increases in properties in development  tax credit partnership receivables and construction contracts receivable 
properties under development increased from million in to million in the number of properties under development increased from in to in receivables from tax credit partnerships increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased land acquisition costs and increased construction cost receivables on the company s rancho mesa  spanish hills and south valley apartments projects 
construction contracts receivable also increased from million in to million in primarily due to increased design build construction costs related to two projects 
net cash provided by used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was   and million  respectively 
the decrease from to in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to an increase in notes receivable and capital contributions to joint ventures  which were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sales of commercial properties 
the increase in cash used in investing activities from to is primarily due to the  of cash utilized in connection with the acquisition of maxim in march and million of cash utilized in connection with the acquisition of diamond key in november expenditures for property acquisitions and improvements increased from million in to million in due to an increase in the development of portfolio properties 
the company added three new portfolio properties under development during compared to two during net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to the net effect of the proceeds from the offering and certain amounts paid in conjunction with the offering 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities from to is primarily due to net proceeds from notes payable of million during compared to million in interest costs incurred  expensed and capitalized were as follows in thousands year ended december interest incurred residential   commercial   total incurred   interest expensed residential  commercial   total expensed   interest capitalized at end of year residential  commercial total interest capitalized   the company has utilized  and may continue to utilize  options and contingent sales contracts as a method of controlling and subsequently acquiring land 
by controlling land through these methods on the future discretionary purchase of land  the company attempts to minimize its cash outlays and reduce its risk from changing market conditions 
while the company attempts to prudently manage its acquisition and development of property  the development of such property can have a negative impact on liquidity due to the timing of acquisition and development activities 
if strategic acquisitions or joint venture opportunities arise  the capital resources of the company may be utilized to undertake such opportunities 
the timing and nature of these opportunities cannot be predicted and the financing of any future strategic acquisition or joint venture may take a variety of forms 
the company anticipates that development of portfolio projects during will cost approximately million in the aggregate  substantially all of which is expected to be financed with construction loans 
the real estate development business is capital intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire and entitle land and commence development 
the company typically finances  and will continue to finance  its land acquisition and portfolio development activities utilizing the proceeds of institutional loans secured by real property 
in some cases  the company plans to utilize private financing  typically on a short term or interim basis 
in cases where the company holds a property after completion of construction  the company generally seeks to obtain permanent financing secured by the property 
the company also expects to purchase approximately million of construction and computer equipment during at december   the tax credit partnerships were indebted to the company in the aggregate amount of approximately million  representing developer fees and land and construction costs 
of such amount  approximately million is payable to the company by the tax credit partnerships from loan proceeds and additional capital contributions of the investor limited partners 
the company anticipates that approximately million will be paid in and million will be paid to the company during approximately million is payable to the company from the net operating cash flows of the tax credit partnerships 
while management believes that these projects will generate sufficient cash flow to pay the amounts due  there can be no assurance that the receivable will be paid in full or at all 
the company has made its capital contributions to the six tax credit partnerships 
the company is obligated  however  to make operating expense loans  not to exceed an aggregate of million  to meet operating deficits  if any  of such tax credit partnerships 
on february   the company signed an agreement for a million revolving line of credit with a financial institution 
the line of credit provides for borrowings up to million for general working capital requirements  million for acquisition and development  including strategic acquisitions and million for land acquisitions 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by the pledge of certain company receivables and any land acquired with borrowings under the line of credit 
these borrowings bear interest at one percent over the lender s prime rate in effect from time to time 
the agreement also subjects the company to certain financial covenants 
as of december   the company had outstanding indebtedness of  and available borrowings of  under this agreement 
with regard to the company s lines of credit and related party transactions  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
backlog the company s homes are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction 
the majority of the company s homes are sold pursuant to standard sales contracts entered into prior to commencement of construction 
such sales contracts are typically subject to certain contingencies  such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
homes covered by such sales contracts are considered by the company as backlog 
the company does not recognize revenue on homes covered by such contracts until the sales are closed and the risk of ownership has been legally transferred to the buyer 
at december  and  the company had homes and homes  respectively  in backlog  representing aggregate sales values of approximately and million  respectively 
as part of its sales and marketing efforts  the company builds and maintains model homes in each of its active communities 
the company also builds homes which are under construction or completed for which the company does not yet have sales contracts speculative homes on a project by project basis 
see item business development activities homebuilding marketing and sales 
it is possible that  in the event of adverse economic or other business conditions affecting home buying activity in the company s markets  the company may be required to reduce prices or provide sales incentives to liquidate its inventory of model or speculative homes 
it is also possible that the company could be required to reduce prices or provide sales incentives sell its model homes at the conclusion of a particular community 
either of these actions  if taken  could have the effect of depressing the company s gross margin for the relevant periods 
the company is also involved in the design build development of commercial projects 
backlog for such commercial projects is defined as the uncompleted work remaining under a signed fixed price contract 
the company uses the percentage of completion method to account for revenue from its design build contracts 
at december  and  the company had backlog under its design build contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
effects of changing prices  inflation and interest rates management believes that inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operations 
substantial increases in labor costs  workers compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect the operations of the company for future periods to the extent that the company is unable to pass such increases on to its construction clients or the purchasers of its properties 
the company had outstanding approximately million of floating rate debt exclusive of the indebtedness of unconsolidated partnerships of which the company is a general partner  currently bearing a weighted average interest rate of per annum at december  if the interest rates on the floating rate debt increase in accordance with changes to the indices upon which the rates are based  debt service obligations of the company will increase 
the potential adverse impact of inflation on the company s rental operations is mitigated by the inclusion of rent adjustment clauses in its longer term nonresidential leases and by generally requiring tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real property taxes  insurance and utilities 
the company s shorter term nonresidential leases and its residential leases  which are typically for terms of or months  permit the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of the leased space 
management believes that the company s future homebuilding activities may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates and changing prices 
higher interest rates may decrease the demand for new homes by making it more difficult for homebuyers to qualify for mortgages or to obtain mortgages at interest rates that are acceptable to the potential buyers 
in addition  the company  as well as the homebuilding industry in general  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily as a result of higher land acquisition and land development costs  as well as higher costs of labor and materials 
the company attempts to pass on to its customers any increase in costs through higher sales prices 
there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material impact on the company s future results of operations 
variability of results and seasonality the company historically has experienced  and in the future expects to continue to experience  variability in revenue on a quarterly basis 
factors expected to contribute to this variability include  among others  i the timing of home and other property sale closings  ii the company s ability to continue to acquire land and options thereon on acceptable terms  iii the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for the construction of homes and other development projects  iv the condition of the real estate market and the general economic conditions in the greater las vegas  salt lake city  phoenix  tuscon and reno metropolitan areas  v the prevailing interest rates and the availability of financing  both for the company and for the purchasers of the company s homes and other properties  vi the timing of the completion of construction of the company s homes and other portfolio properties and vii the cost and availability of materials and labor 
the company s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results and  in particular  the company expects its financial results to vary from project to project and from quarter to quarter 
in addition  although the company has not previously experienced significant seasonality in its business  management expects that the company s increased focus on homebuilding activities may cause it to experience seasonal variations in its home sales as a result of the preference of home buyers to close new home purchases either prior to the start of a new school year or prior to the end of year holiday season

year the company s process for becoming year yk compliant has been to perform an ongoing comprehensive study and review of computer hardware  software and systems  both internal and external  and non computer related systems which may be affected by certain computerized functions 
the company does not believe the non computer related systems  whether yk compliant or not  will have a material impact on the company s operations 
the company has contacted or will contact its significant service providers  vendors  suppliers  subcontractors  financial institutions  consultants and various government agencies  to obtain information regarding the assurance of yk compliance 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of others upon which the co any s systems rely will be yk compliant in a timely manner 
failure to convert by an external source or provider or the failure to convert properly would have a material adverse effect on the company  as would the company s failure to convert  or convert properly  an internal system 
the company has also increased the awareness of the yk issue across the company  assessed the company s yk issues  determined proposed resolutions  validated those proposed resolutions and implemented most system solutions 
the company has substantially completed its assessment of applications within the company that are not yk compliant and is in varying stages of determining appropriate resolutions to the issues identified 
the company currently expects to complete all business critical internal hardware and software modification and testing by the end of the second quarter of given the information known at this time about the company s systems and such issues  coupled with the company s ongoing  normal course of business efforts to upgrade or replace business critical systems and software applications as necessary  it is currently expected that yk costs  the majority of which are expected to be incurred in fiscal  will approximate  current yk expenditures have been negligible thus far due to much of the work performed by existing internal staff 
any further costs will be incorporated into the company s operating plan for fiscal these costs include incremental personnel costs  consulting costs and costs for the modification of or replacement of existing hardware and software 
these costs will be funded through cash flows from operations and are expensed as incurred 
purchased hardware and software will be capitalized in accordance with the company s normal accounting policy 
the costs of the project and the timing in which the company believes it will complete the necessary yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the success of the company in identifying systems and programs having yk issues  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace the affected programs  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the extent to which the company might be adversely impacted by third party vendors  subcontractors  lenders  bond trustees  etc 
failure to remediate their own yk issues 
failure by the company and or its vendors and subcontractors and in particular  the local governments  on which the company is materially dependent to complete yk compliance work in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that its business operations are not heavily dependent on yk compliance of its systems and that  should a reasonably likely worst case yk situation occur  the company  because of the basic nature of its systems  many of which can be executed manually  would not likely suffer material loss or disruption in remedying the situation 
the company currently has not established a formal contingency plan in the event the company is not successful with its attempts to be fully yk compliant  however  the company believes that it will develop a more formal contingency plan that may include the stockpiling of construction raw materials  automated reports and the development of back up systems as an alternative to computers in the months prior to december  special cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business sections contain certain forward looking statements and information relating to the company that are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
such forward looking statements include  without limitation  the company s expectation and estimates as to the company s business operations  including the introduction of new products and future financial performance  including growth in revenues and net income and cash flows 
in addition  included herein the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  plans  proposes  intends and similar expressions  as they late to the company or its management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company s management  with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
in addition  the company specifically wishes to advise readers that the factors listed under the captions liquidity and capital resources  effects of changing prices  inflation and interest rates and other risk factors including but not limited to the primary dependence on the greater las vegas and phoenix areas  insufficient history in geographic areas other than las vegas  risks of homebuilding and other real estate development and investments  indebtedness  potential inability to obtain future financing  variability  erratic weather conditions and seasonality of results  dependence on key personnel  control by current stockholders  regulatory and environmental risks  and expansion into new markets could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those discussed herein as anticipated  believed  established or expected

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which includes borrowings under lines of credit 
these lines  along with cash flow from operations  are used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
the company typically replaces borrowings under its lines of credit  as necessary  with long term fixed rate and shorter termed variable rate financing generally secured by real estate 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of interest rates and business financing requirements  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
the company does not currently use derivative instruments to adjust the company s interest rate risk profile
