management anticipates moderate revenue and earnings growth in from existing inovoject r operations in the united states and canada  new inovoject r system leases in other countries  and sales of bursaplex r product to poultry producers in the united states and other countries 
however  the rate at which the marketplace will accept the inovoject r technology outside the united states and canada  the timing of regulatory approvals of third party vaccines for in ovo use outside the united states and canada  start up costs in new markets  possible variability in us hatchery bird production as a result of grain price fluctuations  and possible variability in the demand for us poultry and poultry products outside the us  will impact the pace of revenue growth  if any  and the sustaining of profitability from the installation and operational throughputs of inovoject r systems 
sales of bursaplex r  the company s proprietary vaccine for the treatment of avian infectious bursal disease  was the principal source of  of product revenues in and million of product revenues in the company s ability to generate revenue from product sales has been constrained by the previously announced delay associated with ft 
dodge s obtaining british regulatory approval for the sale of bursamune tm in the united kingdom  lower levels of breeder and broiler flock vaccination rates  and fewer reported incidences of bursal disease in the united states

the company anticipates completing its test plans no later than may the company expects to complete all remediation  testing and implementation no later than october to date  the company has determined that its general ledger and primary financial accounting software  a dos based application  uses only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
the company is currently on schedule to replace this application with a year compliant windows based system by october  however  the company had planned to make this upgrade irrespective of the year problem in order to meet the demands of its business 
the company is in the process of upgrading its computer software and hardware systems as necessary to address both its increased internal needs and the impact of the year on its systems 
the inability of the company or its software or hardware vendors to upgrade the company s systems in a manner that fully addresses the company s needs and the year issue could adversely impact the company s ability to produce the information necessary to manage its business  communicate with its customers and prepare its financial statements 
the company has surveyed nearly all of its customers and vendors through a year questionnaire regarding the strategies  activities and contingency plans undertaken by those parties to achieve year compliance 
the information being received in response to the questionnaire will assist the company in assessing its readiness for the year issue and identify any potential negative impact to the company from possible disruptions in other parties ability to do business with the company after december  there is no assurance that the systems of other parties on which the company relies will be compliant on a timely basis 
the inability of the company s vendors and customers to fully address the year issue could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to operate and manage the inovoject r system at its customers hatcheries  to manage its business and to communicate with its customers and suppliers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results

the company s estimates regarding the cost and timing of addressing the year issue are based upon presently available information and assumptions about future events 
embrex cannot guarantee that its assumptions will be correct or that its estimates will be achieved 
actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations as a result of numerous factors  including the continued availability of certain resources  the cooperation of third parties  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  unforeseen circumstances that would cause the company to allocate its resources elsewhere  and similar uncertainties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s operations are in jurisdictions outside north america

at december   the company s operations outside north america were not material to the company s consolidated results as a whole  and a significant change in currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the jurisdiction outside north america in which the company operates would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial results
