item a 
market risk s the company is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments  pursuant to company policies 
the value of the us dollar effects the company s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect the company s revenues as expressed in us dollars  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings 
where the company deems it to be prudent  it engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
using primarily forward exchange contracts  the company hedges those transactions that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  impact the income statement 
from time to time  the company purchases short term forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the anticipated revenue of the company s international subsidiaries 
as of december   the company has outstanding foreign currency forward contracts aggregating million related to debt and the purchase and sale of merchandise 
the contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of spanish pesetas million  deutsch mark million  british pounds million and australian dollars million 
the contracts expire at various dates through november at december   the company had net deferred gains from foreign currency forward contracts of million 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s programs include volatility of the currency markets  and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that are entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although the company maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which the company sells products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which the company incurs costs  the company s revenues or costs are adversely affected
