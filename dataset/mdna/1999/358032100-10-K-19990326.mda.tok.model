in addition  the company s quarterly results of operations have been  and may continue to be  materially impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and by restaurant closings 
the fourth quarter normally includes weeks of operations as compared with weeks for each of the three prior quarters 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income in the fourth quarter are not comparable to results in each of the first three fiscal quarters  and net sales and income can be expected to decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year in comparison to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year

the company s outstanding series b non voting convertible preferred stock is currently held by one entity and is convertible  at the holders option  into series a voting convertible preferred stock on a one for one basis 
although no series a preferred stock is currently outstanding  holders of series a preferred stock would be entitled to vote with common stockholders on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
when and if issued  the holders of a majority of the outstanding series a preferred stock will have a separate right to approve certain corporate actions 
the company did not achieve an earnings target before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of  in which constituted an event of default under the terms of the preferred stock agreement and triggered the right of the series a preferred stockholders to elect a majority of the company s board of directors 
the holder of the series b preferred stock has not initiated any action to convert such shares into shares of series a preferred stock nor has it exercised its right to elect a majority of the board of directors 
such holder has notified the company that it has no present intention of exercising such right  however  it has not waived any of its rights under the agreement 
upon achievement of certain per share market price tests  the company may force a mandatory conversion of the series a preferred stock to common stock 
no shares of series c preferred stock are currently outstanding but an option to purchase such shares is outstanding 
the series a  series b and series c preferred stock are senior to the company s common stock with respect to dividends and with respect to distributions on liquidation 
the company s continued growth depends to a significant degree on its ability to open new restaurants and to operate such restaurants profitably 
the company intends to resume its restaurant expansion  assuming its financial performance improves 
the company s ability to implement an expansion strategy will depend upon a variety of factors  including the continued success of efforts to restore profitability and the company s ability to obtain funds 
see business business risks expansion 
the company believes its operating cash requirements and fiscal capital requirements can be met through existing cash balances  cash provided by operations  equipment leases and its loan and security agreement 
the company may continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to provide greater flexibility toward improving its operating performance and continuing expansion 
inflation many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage could materially increase the company s labor costs 
the federal minimum wage increased effective september   the state of california minimum wage increased effective march   and the state of washington minimum wage increased effective january  the company raised prices in responses to these increases 
no further minimum wage increases are scheduled 
in addition  the cost of food commodities utilized by the company are subject to market supply and demand pressures 
shifts in these costs may have a significant impact on the company s food costs 
the company anticipates that increases in these costs can be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there is no assurance that the company would be able to pass such costs on to its guests or that even if it were able to do so  it could do so in a short period of time 
year software requirements the company has completed a review of all its restaurant and corporate computer systems for compliance with the year the company has determined that certain of its existing computer systems use only two digits to identify a year in the date field and  as a result  may improperly identify the year in calculating and processing information 
the company recognizes this system design could cause certain systems to potentially fail or create erroneous results by or at the year but believes its current strategic information plan is addressing the problem 
the company is currently in the process of migrating its critical processing and information requirements to outsourced processing companies whose software is represented to be year compliant 
the company expects to complete this system migration  begun in  during with no significant incremental costs 
in accordance with its strategic information plan  the company is already replacing certain restaurant systems  primarily its restaurant point of sale system  used for capturing and transmitting data to the outsourced systems  with year compliant systems 
the company expects to have the critical restaurant systems in place by approximately the middle of at an estimated equipment cost of  which is to be capitalized in accordance with normal policy and which will be funded either through operating cash flow  equipment lease financing  or borrowings under the company s loan and security agreement 
the company has also contacted outside entities with which it interacts electronically and requested information regarding whether or not their systems are or will be year compliant 
the company is monitoring the progress of outside entities that are in the process of developing year compliance  but it does not believe there is a material risk to the company that these entities will not achieve compliance or if these entities do not achieve compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other entities will be converted timely  or that a failure to convert by another entity will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
as part of its continuous monitoring process  the company will implement contingency plans as necessary 
these plans could include  but are not limited to  alternate product suppliers  manual recording and accumulation of restaurant transactions  and restriction of the tender types accepted at the restaurants 
the company believes it has an effective plan in place to anticipate and resolve any potential year issues in a timely manner 
in the event  however  that the company does not properly identify year issues and remediation and testing is not conducted on a timely basis with respect to the year issues that are identified  there can be no assurance that year issues will not materially and adversely affect the company 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues also could materially and adversely affect the company

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the company will adopt this statement for its fiscal year beginning december  the company does not expect that adoption of this statement will impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the cost of start up activities  which requires companies to expense the costs of start up activities and organization costs as incurred 
the company will adopt sop effective for its fiscal year beginning december  and expense  of unamortized pre opening costs at the time of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if market rates were to increase immediately by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings would not be materially affected as borrowings are primarily subject to variable interest rates
