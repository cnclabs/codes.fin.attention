year readiness disclosure the company is preparing for the impact of the arrival of the year on its business 
the year issue is a term used to describe the problems created by systems that are unable to accurately interpret dates after december  these problems are derived predominantly from the fact that many software programs have historically categorized the year in a two digit format 
the year issue creates potential risks for the company  including potential problems in the company s products as well as in the information technology it and non it systems that the company uses in its business operations 
the company may also be exposed to risks from third parties with whom the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own year issues 
the company is pursuing an organized program to assure the company s products  production equipment and information systems and related infrastructure will be year compliant 
the company s year program includes four phases an audit and assessment phase designed to identify year issues  a modification and testing phase designed to correct year issues internally  a purchase phase designed to correct year issues externally  and an implementation and test phase to install and test the system for year compliance for external purchases 
the company has completed the audit and assessment phases for all products 
the modification of all products and related testing was completed by december  selected older and discontinued products are not year compliant and customers have been advised 
the company has established an internet site as contemplated by the year readiness disclosure act to assist customers and provide information related to the year issue 
the cost to update products for year compliance was not significant and was completed in conjunction with ongoing development efforts 
the company has completed the audit and assessment of production equipment and related infrastructure 
such equipment and infrastructure is year compliant 
the company has completed an audit and assessment of the year issue for the computer system 
the company s computer system is not year compliant 
this could cause a system failure or miscalculations  causing operation disruption and a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has leased a new computer system that is year compliant 
this system cost  and was received in august and september  internal costs are expected to increase  per year due to the computer system installation 
the external installation and training costs are estimated to be  and the installation is estimated to be completed by june   which would be prior to any significant impact of the year on its operating systems 
training and installation costs of  related to the new computer system have been incurred as of december  the  will be paid from operating cash flow 
the system installation should not defer any additional systems projects 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which its raw materials are vulnerable to the year issue 
if any suppliers indicate that they are not year compliant  the company plans to develop contingency plans to address the issue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be completely successful in its efforts to address year issues 
if the company s products are not year compliant  the company could suffer lost sales or other negative consequences  including  but not limited to  diversion of resources  damage to the company s reputation  increased service and warranty costs and litigation  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business operations or financial statements 
the company is also dependent on third parties  such as its customers  suppliers  service providers and other business partners 
if these or other third parties fail to adequately address year issues  the company could experience a negative impact on its business operations or financial statements 
for example  the failure of certain of the company s principal suppliers to have year compliant systems could impact the company s ability to manufacture and or ship its products or to maintain adequate inventory levels for production 
at the present time  the company does not have a contingency plan to operate in the event that its business systems  products and raw materials are not year compliant 
if testing scheduled for the first and second quarters of suggests that there is a significant risk that the computer system  products and raw materials might not be year compliant  the company anticipates developing a contingency plan 
notice various statements in this discussion of year are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include statements of the company s expectations  statements with regard to schedules  cost and expected completion dates and statements regarding expected year compliance 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risk factors which may materially affect the company s efforts to achieve year compliance 
these risk factors include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to install the new computer system on a timely basis  the ability to source year compliant raw materials  and the completion of product modifications 
the company is attempting to reduce the risks by utilizing an organized approach  extensive testing  and allowance of ample contingency time to address issues identified by tests 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all borrowings under the company s bank line of credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would not significantly impact the company s net income 
all of the company s business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations should not have a significant impact on the company
