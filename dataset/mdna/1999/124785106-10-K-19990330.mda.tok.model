item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes in trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains statements relating to future results of the company including certain projections and business trends that are considered forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  changes in political and economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  competitive product and pricing pressures within the company s market  equity and bond market fluctuations  personal and corporate customers bankruptcies  inflation  acquisitions and integrations of acquired businesses  and risks relating to year issues 
accordingly  historical performance may not be a reliable indicator of future earnings

net interest income net interest income is the largest single component of the company s earnings and represents the difference between interest income received on loans and other earning assets and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income  on a taxable equivalent basis  was million in  a decrease of million  or  from during  the company s net interest margin declined to  compared to for as summarized on table  the million decrease in net interest income for consisted of a million decrease in interest income coupled with a million increase in interest expense 
the average yield on interest earning assets in declined by six basis points to  which offset the million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets 
the million decrease in interest income was primarily due to the million decrease in the average balance of taxable investment securities 
interest costs on interest bearing deposits and liabilities were relatively stable with an increase of only million in the increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities of million was partially offset by the seven basis point decrease in the average cost of funds to 
the following table sets forth the condensed consolidated average balance sheets  an analysis of interest income expense and average yield rate for each major category of earning assets and interest bearing deposits and liabilities for the years indicated on a taxable equivalent basis 
the taxable equivalent adjustment is made for items exempt from federal income taxes assuming a tax rate to make them comparable with taxable items before any income taxes are applied

yields and amounts earned include loan fees 
non accrual loans have been included in interest earning assets for purposes of these computations 
provision and allowance for credit losses the amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on periodic evaluations by management 
in these evaluations  management considers numerous factors including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  loan portfolio composition  loan loss experience and management s estimate of potential losses 
these various analyses lead to a determination of the amount needed in the allowance for credit losses 
to the extent the existing allowance is below the amount so determined  a provision is made that will bring the allowance to such an amount 
thus  the provision for credit losses may fluctuate and may not be comparable from year to year 
provision for credit losses was million in  an increase of million  or  from the company s allowance for credit losses increased to million at december   from million in and million in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period end total loans was at december   compared to and at and allowance for credit losses as a percentage of the period end non performing loans was at december   which compares to at december  total non performing loans at december  amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from the million at december  during  the company sold million in delinquent loans  including million of non performing loans at a loss of million see related discussion in other income 
the net investment in loans that are considered to be impaired was million at december   a decrease of million from the million at december  the decrease in impaired loans was due primarily to settlement of loans through acquisition of the real estate collateral or principal repayments 
additional information on impaired loans is presented in notes a and d of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other income in  total other income was million as compared to million in and million in the million increase in other income was due primarily to gains on the sale of securities 
during  the company sold million of securities at a net gain of million  which compares to gains of million and million in and  respectively see note b of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
other income was million for  a decrease of million  or  from other income includes a loss of million on the sale of million of delinquent real estate loans made to enhance the asset quality of the company s loan portfolio 
the other income decline in compared to was primarily attributable to the million decline in net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities 
the company sold its credit card portfolio in resulting in the loss of commissions and fees relating to these discontinued operations 
other income also includes a million amortization of gain

the following table sets forth information by category of other operating income for the company for the years indicated in thousands of dollars net realized gains on sales of securities   other service charges and fees    service charges on deposits    net trading account losses other   total    other expenses the following table sets forth information by category of other operating expenses of the company for the years indicated in thousands of dollars salaries and employee benefits    net occupancy expense    equipment expense    legal and professional fees    advertising and promotion    provision for other real estate owned losses  deposit insurance premiums  voluntary separation benefits  other    total    total operating expenses as a percent of average assets other operating expenses decreased by million in to million  compared to million in and in the company s operating expense ratio total operating expense as a percentage of average assets  which is a commonly used indicator of operating efficiency  decreased by basis points in to  compared to in and in the primary reasons for the decrease in other expenses were the million reduction in salaries and employment benefits plus the million decrease in legal and professional fees  which offset the million increase in provision for other real estate owned losses oreo 
salaries and employment benefits declined by million  or  in to million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the reduction in salaries and employee benefits over the last three years reflect management s continuing efforts to improve operating efficiency and reduce overhead costs 
on january   the company announced a voluntary separation plan for all employees 
the program offered all eligible employees the opportunity of electing to terminate their employment 
ninety seven employees participated in the program and voluntary separation benefits of million were expensed and paid 
legal and professional fees dropped by million  or  in due  in part  to management s close monitoring of such expenses and reduction in the use of consultants and other external resources 
legal and professional fees are anticipated to increase in as a result of external resources utilized in connection with the company s year efforts see year discussion 
provision for oreo losses totaled million for  an increase of million from the million in at december   oreo net of valuation allowance amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
the increase in the oreo balance and provision for oreo losses reflects the continued weakness in the hawaii economy and related decline in real estate values 
the company has also been more aggressive in its delinquent loan collection efforts resulting in a higher level of foreclosures and related oreo 
net occupancy expense was million in  which compares to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net occupancy expense in was primarily attributable to the increased occupancy costs of the association from the reacquisition through assignment of its ground lease obligation of vacated premises

liquidity management the primary objective of liquidity management is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order that the cash flow needs of the company are met in the most economical and expedient manner 
the liquidity needs of a financial institution require the availability of cash to meet the withdrawal demands of depositors and the credit commitments of borrowers 
in order to optimize liquidity  management monitors and forecasts the various sources and uses of funds in an effort to continually meet the financial requirements of the company and the financial needs of its customer base 
to ensure liquidity on a short term basis  the company s primary sources are cash or cash equivalents  loan repayments  proceeds from the sale of assets available for sale  increases in deposits  proceeds from maturing securities and  when necessary  federal funds purchased and credit arrangements with correspondent banks and the fhlb 
maturities of investment securities are also structured to cover large commitments and seasonal fluctuations in credit arrangements 
the consolidated statements of cash flows identify three major sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities 
as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company s operating activities used million in  an increase of million from the million in the primary use of cash flows from operations in was the million net increase in loans held for sale  which amounted to million at december  investing activities provided cash flow of million in compared to a net use of million during  and an increase in cash flow of million in the primary source of cash flow from investing activities in was from the proceeds on sales of securities which totalled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
financing activities used cash flow of million in  compared to providing million during  and a reduction in cash flow of million in during  an million net decrease in short term borrowings and million in principal payments on long term debt were the primary use of cash flows from financing activities 
as of december   the bank and association had available unused credit lines of million from the fhlb and committed available lines of credit from other sources 
at any time  the company has outstanding commitments to extend credit 
see notes h  i and n of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
capital resources the company has a strong capital base with a tier i capital ratio of at december  this is well above the minimum regulatory guideline of for tier i capital 
bank holding companies are also required to comply with risk based capital guidelines as established by the federal reserve board 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets that include both on and off balance sheet exposures 
a company s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital the numerator of the ratio by its risk weighted assets the denominator 
the minimum required qualifying total capital ratio is

year the year problem is a significant issue facing financial institutions 
because computers frequently use only two digits to recognize years instead of four digits  many computer systems  as well as equipment using embedded computer chips  may be unable to distinguish the year this could produce erroneous results or systems may fail in the year when the two digit year becomes 
in  the company established a year committee comprised of senior managers from each major operational unit 
the year committee has prepared a comprehensive program to address this problem and ensure that the company s computer systems will function properly in the years and thereafter 
the company s year effort is divided in phases for awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
the company has already completed the awareness and assessment phase of its year program and has already undertaken renovation and validation of its critical systems 
as of august  both the bank and the association completed the conversion of all core operations to the fiserv comprehensive banking system  a major step in the company s year compliance effort 
initial validation testing of critical systems throughout the company was substantially completed by the end of the company expects to successfully complete its year program in a timely and effective manner 
even though the company s efforts should adequately address year issues  there can be no assurance that unforeseen difficulties will not arise 
the company may be impacted by the year compliance issues of governmental agencies  businesses and other entities who provide data to  or receive data from  the company  and by entities  such as borrowers  vendors and customers  whose financial condition or operational capability is significant to the company 
the company s year program also includes the identification of third party service providers  customers and other external parties upon which the company relies  or with whom it must interface its critical systems or applications 
the company is also subject to credit risk to the extent borrowers fail to adequately address their year issues 
while the company continues to discuss these matters with  obtain written certifications from and test such external parties year compliance efforts  there is no assurance that the failure of these parties to resolve their year issues would not have an adverse impact on the company 
to address this external risk  contingency plans are also being developed to ensure that the company is prepared to handle the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios  including the inability of customers  vendors and other third parties to adequately address the year problem 
contingency plans include identifying triggering events for the plan  assessing mission critical systems failures on core business processes  developing business resumption alternatives  and testing the effectiveness and viability of these plans 
the development and testing of these contingency plans are scheduled to be completed by june the company has expended  and will continue to expend  the resources necessary to address this issue in a timely manner 
through december   cumulative incremental expenditures of less than million have been incurred out of a total projected million 
the incremental expenditures exclude internal cost and the approximately million cost incurred in converting to the fiserv comprehensive banking system 
the company does not separately track internal costs related to the internal allocation of personal and other costs related to the year project 
most of these incremental expenditures relate to the acquisition and implementation of new and enhanced systems and or equipment  which will be capitalized and amortized over their respective useful lives 
expenses related to the company s internal resources and year remediation costs are being expensed as incurred 
future expenditures are expected to take place over the next year  funded by operating cash flows  and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance  however  can be given at this time that all aspects of the company s operations will be year ready or that the year problem will not have an adverse impact on the company s future earnings 
the foregoing year discussion contains forward looking statements 
such statements  including without limitation  anticipated costs and the dates by which the company expects to substantially complete the various year phases  are based on management s best current estimates 
these estimates were derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third party service providers and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to results of year testing  adequate resolution of year issues by governmental agencies  businesses or other third parties that are service providers  suppliers  borrowers or customers of the company  unanticipated system costs  the need to replace hardware  the adequacy of and ability to implement contingency plans  and similar uncertainties 
the forward looking statements made in the foregoing year discussion speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
effects of inflation the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rate changes have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
recent regulatory developments in  the company entered into a memorandum of understanding the mou with the federal reserve bank of san francisco the frb 
under the terms of the mou  the company is required to receive the approval of the frb prior to the payment of dividends  redemption of stock and incurring debt 
in september  the bank also entered into an mou with the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
this mou was terminated by the fdic in march  based on the adoption of a resolution by the bank s board of directors 
this resolution  approved by the bank s board of directors in february  requires  among other things  that city bank obtain approval from the fdic for the payment of cash dividends  and to reduce certain classified assets to specified levels within time frames set forth in the internal agreement 
recent accounting developments in october  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
sfas no 
requires that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or other retained interests based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires entities to recognize all derivatives in their financial statements as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the effective date for sfas no 
is the first fiscal quarter for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk other than trading activities market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the company s management has placed an increased emphasis on interest rate sensitivity management 
interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are those which have yields or rates which are subject to change within a future time period due to either the maturity of the instrument or changes in the rate environment 
gap refers to the difference between the rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
when the amount of rate sensitive assets is in excess of rate sensitive liabilities  a positive gap exists  and when the opposite occurs  a negative gap exists 
generally  when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin is expected to be positively impacted during periods of increasing interest rates and negatively impacted during periods of decreasing interest rates 
interest rate shifts  resulting from movements in the economic environment  can cause interest sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice within relatively short time frames 
as a result  major fluctuations in net interest income and net earnings could occur due to imbalances between rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
asset liability management seeks to protect earnings by maintaining an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to minimize fluctuations in the net interest margin and net earnings in periods of volatile interest rates 
the table below page sets forth information concerning interest rate sensitivity of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first 
in the case of amortizing assets such as mortgage loans  for example maturities are reflected in terms of the expected principal repayment streams  based upon scheduled amortization and anticipated prepayments 
prepayments are estimated using current market expectations for assets with interest rates at similar levels to the company s 
it should be noted that while the company s investment portfolio is classified according to repricing or maturity  all of the portfolio is available for sale 
this will provide the company with the flexibility to restructure the portfolio if it wishes to in the face of a changing interest rate environment 
further note should be taken of the short term classification of most of the company s savings deposits 
in fact  although technically immediately repriceable  most of these deposits are considered to be relatively insensitive to changes in market interest rates 
over non rate in thousands of dollars days days days years years sensitive total assets investment securities and interest bearing deposits in other banks        federal funds sold   commercial loans       real estate loans       consumer loans      other assets   total assets        liabilities and stockholders equity non interest bearing deposits   time and savings deposits       short term borrowing     long term borrowing     other liabilities   stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity        interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      the company s policy is to closely match its level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within a limited range  thereby reducing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in connection with these asset and liability management objectives  various actions have been taken  including changes in the composition of assets and liabilities  and the use of financial instruments 
when appropriate  alco may utilize off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
a board of directors approved hedging policy statement governs use of these instruments 
the financial instruments used and their notional amounts outstanding at year end were as follows december  in thousands of dollars interest rate swaps pay fixed swaps notional amount   average receive rate average pay rate under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amount 
the company paid the fixed rate and received the floating rate under the majority of its swaps outstanding at december  and interest rate contracts are primarily used to convert certain deposits and long term debt to floating interest rates or to convert certain groups of customer loans and other interest earning assets to fixed rates 
certain interest rate swaps specifically match the amounts and terms of particular liabilities 
interest rate options  which primarily consists of caps and floors  are interest rate protection instruments that involve the payment from the seller to the buyer of an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid by the buyer 
this differential represents the difference between current interest rates and an agreed upon rate applied to a notional amount 
interest rate caps limit the cap holder s risk associated with an increase in interest rates 
interest rate floors limit the risk associated with a decline in interest rates 
interest rate options at december  and consisted of the following notional estimated notional estimated in thousands of dollars amount fair value amount fair value caps    floors  total interest rate options    interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet as well as for off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  estimated rate change nii sensitivity bp bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
