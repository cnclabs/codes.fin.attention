year the year problem concerns the inability of information systems to recognize properly and process date sensitive information beyond december  in july  the company initiated a formal program to identify and resolve year issues 
the scope of the program includes the investigation of all company functions and services  including embedded systems in what are not traditionally considered information technology systems 
the company has identified its resident billing and general ledger as internal systems that present a high level of risk from a year perspective 
the company has also identified several key external systems that could pose significant risk to the company those of various governmental agencies  particularly medicare and medicaid  its payroll provider  and its investment management companies and other financial intermediaries 
the company has also acquired several facilities and or utilizes third party management companies to provide financial information 
these acquired systems must also be brought into the company s program 
the company has completed the planning and awareness and systems inventory phases of the program 
the assessment phase is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal  with the correction phase being completed by the third quarter of the same year 
the company is beginning the process of assessing the risk of supplier readiness  and in selected cases will review the preparedness of individual suppliers for the year problem 
the company currently estimates the cost of the year program will approximate  with a range of plus or minus twenty five percent 
the company s corporate personnel who directly oversee functions at the facility level will also assist in the year program as part of their regular duties 
this is expected to help reduce year costs 
all costs  except long lived assets  are expensed as incurred 
these costs include the costs of outside consultants  systems replacements  and other equipment requirements 
the costs incurred to date are not material 
year continued ultimately  the potential impact of the year issue will depend not only on the corrective measures the company undertakes  but also on the way in which the year issue is addressed by governmental agencies  businesses and other entities whose financial condition or operational capability is important to the company 
communications with significant third parties will be initiated to determine the extent of risk created by those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues  however  it is not possible  at present  to determine the financial effect if their remediation efforts are not completed in a timely manner 
while the company expects to resolve all year risks without a material adverse impact on its results of operations and financial position  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate success of the program 
uncertainties exist as to the company s ability to detect all year problems as well as its ability to achieve successful and timely resolution of all year issues 
a reasonably likely worst case scenario of year risks for the company could include the inability to receive reimbursement from medicare and medicaid  and problems involving the inability of the company s financial intermediaries to accurately reflect the company s cash position 
the consequences of these issues may include lost revenue and lower cash receipts 
the company is unable to quantify the potential effect of these items on its results of operations  liquidity  and financial position should some or a combination of these events occur 
in addition  because the company s day to day operations are heavily dependent on its ability to communicate information throughout its network of facilities  the company would be particularly susceptible to any possible effects that the year issue has on local and national communications systems  including without limitation  telephone and data lines  because of the difficulty in implementing viable contingency plans 
any interruption or malfunction of such systems could have a material adverse effect on the company 
as the correction phase of the program is completed in mid  the company expects to have developed contingency plans  which would augment existing contingency plans  for the then current risks
