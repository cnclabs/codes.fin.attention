the company s long range strategic plan emphasizes providing stability for its operations through expanding its product offerings to minimize the impact of individual product cycles on the company s overall performance and by entering into long term strategic alliances 
in pursuing these goals  the company has sought alternatives to its reliance in and on the domestic market for large diameter pipe  the demand for which has declined significantly from levels experienced in those years 
in an effort to decrease the company s reliance on the domestic large diameter pipe market and provide additional end use for its steel plate  the company acquired a percent interest in the camrose pipe mill in june from stelco  a large canadian steel producer  which owns the remaining percent interest in the camrose pipe mill 
in  and  camrose shipped   and  tons  respectively  of steel pipe and generated revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
during those years stelco was a major supplier of steel plate and coil for the camrose pipe mill 
to expand the company s steel product lines and enter new geographic areas  cf i purchased the pueblo mill and related assets in march in  and the pueblo mill shipped   and  tons  respectively  and generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
in august new cf i sold a percent equity interest in new cf i to a subsidiary of nippon 
in connection with that sale  nippon agreed to license to the company its proprietary technology for producing dhh rail under a separate equipment supply agreement 
in november the company sold a percent equity interest in new cf i to two companies of nissho iwai  a large japanese trading company 
the labor contract at the rmsm division expired on september  after a brief contract extension intended to help facilitate a possible contract  on october  the union initiated a strike at the rmsm division 
see part i business labor dispute 
the rmsm division began to ramp its operations back up in mid october with management and replacement workers 
shipment levels and cost of operations were negatively impacted by reduced production levels and costs specifically related to the strike 
fourth quarter shipments at the rmsm division were  tons compared to shipments of  tons in the fourth quarter of company sales in the fourth quarter of of million increased percent from sales of million in the fourth quarter of company shipments increased percent to  tons in the fourth quarter of from  tons in the fourth quarter of the company s average selling price in the fourth quarter of was per ton versus per ton in the fourth quarter of the increase in sales and shipments for the fourth quarter of was primarily due to recovery from the fourth quarter strike at the rmsm division and the start up of the combination mill at the oregon steel division 
the lower average selling price in the fourth quarter of is primarily due to reduced average pricing for rod  seamless pipe and commodity plate products 
the oregon steel division shipped  tons with an average selling price of per ton during the fourth quarter of  compared to  tons with an average selling price per ton of during the fourth quarter of increased fourth quarter shipment levels are the result of increased plate production compared to the fourth quarter of in which production was negatively impacted by the start up of the combination mill 
the company shut down its old plate rolling mill in september and shifted all plate production to the combination mill 
the combination mill experienced delays and an outage during the fourth quarter of which significantly reduced the portland mill s production and increased production costs 
the reduced average selling price is primarily due to substantially lower market prices for steel plate during the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding period 
during the fourth quarter of  the rmsm division shipped  tons with an average selling price of per ton compared to  tons with an average selling price of per ton during the fourth quarter of increased fourth quarter shipment levels are the result of increased rail and rod shipments compared to the fourth quarter of in which production was negatively impacted by the strike mentioned above 
rail and rod shipments were  tons and  tons  respectively  in the fourth quarter of compared to  tons of rail and  tons of rod in the fourth quarter of the reduced average selling price compared to is the result of adverse market conditions in the seamless pipe and rod markets as described in the annual comparison below 
gross profits as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter of were percent compared to a negative for the fourth quarter of gross profit for the fourth quarter of was negatively impacted by costs specifically related to the strike and lower production resulting from both the strike and the start up of the combination mill 
the company expects results of operations to be negatively impacted by adverse market conditions for its seamless pipe  rod and commodity plate products during the first half of and quite possibly for the entire period 
the negative impact of these markets will be partially offset by strong welded pipe shipments from the company s napa and camrose pipe mills and expected good rail markets in the company expects to ship approximately million tons of product during the oregon steel division anticipates that it will ship  tons of welded pipe shipments and over  tons of plate and coil products during in november  the napa pipe mill began production of welded pipe for the alliance pipeline 
during the fourth quarter of  napa pipe shipped over  tons of the alliance order of which  tons remained intransit at year end 
during  the company expects to ship over  tons of the alliance order from its napa and camrose pipe mills 
the rmsm division anticipates that it will ship over  tons of rail  and  tons of rod  bar  seamless pipe and semifinished products 
these results are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially 
comparison of to sales 
sales in of million increased percent from sales of million in shipments increased percent to million tons in from million tons in the average selling price in was per ton versus per ton in of the million sales increase  million was the result of volume increases and million resulted from higher average selling prices offset by million of insurance proceeds 
the increase in sales and shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of plate  coil and welded pipe products by the oregon steel division and increased shipments of rail products by the rmsm division  offset in part by decreased shipments of seamless pipe and rod and bar products by the rmsm division 
the increased shipments include a percent increase in welded pipe shipments   in compared to  tons in and increased plate and coil shipments due to increased production from the combination mill 
the increased average selling price for is due to increased shipments of welded pipe products as a percent of total products shipped  partially offset by reduced pricing for seamless pipe  rod and commodity plate products 
the markets for the company s plate products were negatively affected by high levels of imports 
the company s commodity plate pricing declined approximately a ton since the beginning of as a result of import activity 
reduced seamless pipe prices are due to the low level of oil prices which have reached a year low and reduced us rig counts which have fallen near all time lows 
rod product is being severely impacted by the high level of imported rod shipments entering the united states 
average rod pricing has declined over a ton since the beginning of gross profits 
gross profits as a percentage of sales for were percent compared to percent for gross profit margins were positively impacted by increased margins on shipments of welded pipe and rail  offset by lower margins on rod and seamless pipe resulting from the adverse market conditions described above 
also  production costs and gross margins were negatively impacted by the startup of the combination mill and by the labor dispute at the rmsm division as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased million or percent compared to and decreased as a percent of revenues from percent in to percent in the dollar amount increase was primarily due to increased shipping costs due to increased tons shipped in compared to and costs specifically related to the labor dispute with the union at rmsm 
contribution to esop and profit participation 
there was a million contribution to the esop in compared to no contribution in profit participation plan expense which is paid on a quarterly basis was million in compared to million in the decrease in profit participation reflects the decreased profitability in the first three quarters of compared to those quarters of interest expense

the decrease in sales and shipments was primarily due to decreased shipments of plate product by the oregon steel division and decreased shipments of seamless pipe and semifinished products by the rmsm division  offset in part by increased shipments of rail and rod products by the rmsm division 
plate shipments declined primarily due to the start up of the combination mill at the portland mill 
shipments at the rmsm division were negatively impacted by the labor dispute during the fourth quarter of the higher average selling price in was due to increased shipments of welded pipe and higher selling prices for all pipe products  partially offset by increased shipments of rod  which have a generally lower selling price per ton than the other finished products sold by the company 
gross profits 
gross profits as a percentage of sales for were percent compared to percent for gross profit margins were negatively impacted by reduced shipments of plate products and increased manufacturing costs at the portland mill due to the start up of the combination mill 
gross profit was positively impacted by increased rail shipments and higher seamless pipe prices at the rmsm division 
in spite of the labor dispute  gross profit was also positively impacted by lower costs at the rmsm division due to increased steel production and improved operating efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased million or percent compared to and increased as a percent of revenues from percent in to percent in the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the labor dispute at rmsm

of the million of interest cost  million was capitalized as part of construction in progress 
income tax expense 
the company s effective income tax rate for state and federal taxes was percent for compared to a percent for the effective income tax rate for both periods varied from the combined state and federal statutory rate due to earned state tax credits and deductible dividends paid on stock held by the esop and paid to esop participants 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations was million compared to million in the major items affecting the million decrease were a larger increase in inventories million  a lower increase in deferred income taxes million  and a larger decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses million 
these cash decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization million  a larger increase in accounts receivable million  and an increase in other current assets versus a decrease in million 
net working capital at december  decreased million compared to december  reflecting a million increase in current assets and a million increase in current liabilities 
short term debt increased from none at the end of to million at the end of the increase represents the company s bank borrowing balance which becomes due in being classified as current at the end of versus non current at the end of the company has outstanding million principal amount of first mortgage notes due new cf i and cf i guarantee the notes 
the notes and the guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all the property  plant and equipment and certain other assets of the company exclusive of camrose and the guarantors 
the collateral for the notes and the guarantees does not include  among other things  inventory and accounts receivable 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains potential restrictions on new indebtedness and various types of disbursements  including dividends  based on the company s net income in relation to its fixed charges  as defined

the guarantors guarantee amounts outstanding under the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants including a minimum tangible net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio  and a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio 
the amended credit agreement has been amended to  among other things  modify the interest coverage ratio due to lower than anticipated earnings and higher than anticipated borrowings 
cf i steel  lp incurred term debt of million as part of the purchase price of the pueblo mill on march  this debt is without stated collateral and is payable over ten years with interest at percent 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the debt was million  of which million was classified as long term 
camrose maintains a million canadian dollars revolving credit facility with a bank  the proceeds of which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of camrose and borrowings under this facility are limited to an amount equal to specified percentages of camrose s eligible trade accounts receivable and inventories

the company has uncollateralized and uncommitted revolving lines of credit with two banks which may be used to support issuance of letters of credit  foreign exchange contracts and interest rate hedges 
at december   million was restricted under outstanding letters of credit 
during the company expended approximately million exclusive of capitalized interest on the capital projects at the pueblo mill  and million exclusive of capitalized interest on capital projects at the oregon steel division 
the company has budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in at its manufacturing facilities for upgrade projects to the present facilities and equipment 
the company believes that its anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through will be met from funds generated by operations and borrowings pursuant to the company s amended credit agreement 
there is no assurance  however  that the amounts available from these sources will be sufficient for such purposes 
in that event  or for other reasons  the company may be required to seek additional financing  which may include additional bank financing 
there is no assurance that such source of funding will be available if required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
failure to obtain required funds would delay or prevent some planned capital expenditure projects from being initiated or completed  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that the company and its subsidiaries may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on their indebtedness when due 
in the event of a default under the amended credit agreement or the notes  or if the company or its subsidiaries are unable to comply with covenants contained in other debt instruments or to pay their indebtedness when due  the holders of such indebtedness generally will be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately and  in the case of collateralized indebtedness  to proceed against their collateral  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the company 
year issues 
as the year approaches  the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
the company s approach to the year issue is discussed below 
the company necessarily makes certain forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections contained in the forward looking statements 
factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to failure of company personnel and outside consultants to properly assess and address the company s year issues  inaccurate or incomplete responses to questionnaires sent to third parties or inaccurate disclosure to third parties regarding the year issue  failure to address the year issue with all vendors  including utility vendors  infrastructure failures such as disruptions in the supply of electricity  gas  water or communications services  or major institutions  such as the government and banking systems  and failure of the company to accurately predict the costs to address the year issue or the lost revenues related to interruption in the company s or its customers businesses 
the company has identified risks from  among other causes  failure of internally developed or purchased software and hardware in its information technology it systems  failure of process logic controller plc components of manufacturing equipment  and business or service interruptions of certain key customers and suppliers 
in mid  the company began to inventory critical systems  assess the exposure to year failures  and replace or remediate it and plc systems as necessary 
as of december   the inventory and assessment of it and plc systems was substantially complete  and investments had been made to replace or remediate critical it systems and plcs where there was an apparent risk of failure at the year the remaining remediation effort and testing is expected to continue through the third quarter of the most critical business systems have been recently functionally upgraded  or are in process of upgrade  and concurrently are becoming year compliant 
the company is soliciting written confirmations from key suppliers confirming that they are addressing their year issues 
although the potential effects of it and plc systems failures due to the year change are not predictable or quantifiable with any certainty  the company expects that if a plc failure occurred  the company would still be able to continue its core production processes  although at a reduced rate and possibly at a substantially increased cost 
similarly  it is anticipated that any affected it business systems which failed could be supplemented with manual and other procedures sufficient to continue operations  although at a reduced efficiency 
in general  the company s customers and sources of supply are sufficiently diverse to mitigate the effect on the company of a supplier or customer experiencing year related failures 
however  there would be a material adverse impact on the company if any of its utility providers were significantly interrupted 
the total cost of preparation for the year is expected to be approximately million  of which less than half has been spent to date 
no reserve has been established 
the company s preparations have not included a specific contingency plan in the event of systems or supplier failures  however  it is anticipated that by mid all critical systems will be remediated and under test internally or by independent outside verification 
impact of inflation 
inflation can be expected to have an effect on many of the company s operating costs and expenses 
due to worldwide competition in the steel industry  the company may not be able to pass through such increased costs to its customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term debt and long term debt 
the following discussion of market risks necessarily makes forward looking statements 
there can be no assurance that actual changes in market conditions and rates and fair values will not differ materially from those used in the sensitivity and fair value calculations discussed 
factors which may cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to greater than percent changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  changes in income or cash flows requiring significant changes in the use of debt instruments or the cash flows associated with them  or changes in commodity market conditions affecting availability of materials in ways not predicted by the company 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis was used to determine the potential impact that market risk exposure may have on the fair values of the company s financial instruments  including debt and cash equivalents 
the company has assessed the potential risk of loss in fair values from hypothetical changes in interest rates by determining the effect on the present value of the future cash flows related to those market sensitive instruments 
the discount rates used for such present value computations were selected based on market interest rates in effect at december   plus or minus percent 
a percent decrease in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a increase in the fair value of the company s financial instruments by million 
a percent increase in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s financial instruments by million 
there would be no material effect on consolidated net income or cash flows from those changes alone 
foreign currency risk in general  the company uses a single functional currency for all receipts  payments and other settlements at its facilities 
occasionally  transactions will be denominated in another currency and a foreign currency forward exchange contract used to hedge currency gains and losses 
at december   the company had usd million notional amount of such contracts  which related to transactions of camrose 
increases or decreases in the year end exchange rate of percent would not have a material financial effect on consolidated net income  cash flows or fair values
