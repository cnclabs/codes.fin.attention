item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in  we decided to change our business from the ownership of high risk  residential collateralized mortgage backed securities to the ownership  acquisition  development and management of manufactured home communities 
this decision helped us to avoid the volatility incurred by other owners of these securities following the capital market crisis in the third quarter of during the last year and a half we have been focused on the investment of our capital in the acquisition of manufactured home communities 
since our capital has not yet been entirely invested into this new business  our financial performance  and consequently our stock price  has been adversely affected during this period 
comparison of to rental property income from rental properties totaled  during and  during the increase between and was due to our acquisition of communities during those years 
our first acquisition of interests in manufactured home communities occurred in may  and as of december   we had invested million in communities 
during  we had invested an additional million in seven communities 
inflation we do not believe that changes in inflation rates would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in fact  we believe that inflation may positively impact our business  in light of the fact that manufactured home communities represent a more affordable housing choice for many people than other alternatives available  increased inflation rates may allow us to demand increased rents without losing tenants 
service operations during  we earned  in property management income versus  during property management income increased during as compared to because property management contracts were not acquired until may amortization of management contracts increased from  to  in and  respectively  due to our acquisition of property management contracts in may and our acquisition of the commercial assets management agreement in november similarly  fee revenue from managing commercial assets was  in and in equity in earnings of commercial assets income from our interest in commercial assets for was  compared to  for prior to november  commercial assets received income from a portfolio of collateralized mortgage backed securities 
it restructured its portfolio in november and temporarily invested the proceeds in short term investments while considering alternative investments 
commercial assets announced that it intended to invest in manufactured home communities in the third quarter of  and as of december   it has invested million in such communities 
commercial assets reported to us that the decrease in income during as compared to was due to lower yields during on short term investments and interests in manufactured home communities compared to yields on collateralized mortgage backed securities during  the gain on the restructuring of the bonds recognized in  and a non recurring  expense in related to the cost of investigating marina investments 
non agency mbs bonds in march  we sold our portfolio of unrated credit support debt interests in non conforming residential mortgage loan securitizations known as non agency mbs bonds in order to reduce risk associated with this type of investment and to maximize long term  risk adjusted returns to stockholders 
consequently  income from non agency mbs bonds decreased to  during compared with  for revenues from non agency mbs bonds subsequent to march represent income from a small equity interest retained from the sale 
no income has been recognized from the retained equity interest after the first quarter of  and we anticipate receiving minimal  if any  additional income in the future from such retained interest 
management fees we incurred  of management fees to our manager during there were no management fees in due to our acquisition of our management agreement in november general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  for compared to  for expenses increased in primarily because of personnel and related expenses incurred as a result of our becoming self administered and self managed in november the cost increase was partially offset by  of nonrecurring costs incurred in related to our reverse stock split 
interest and other income interest and other income for was  compared to  for the proceeds from the restructuring of the non agency mbs bonds were temporarily invested until they were used to acquire manufactured home communities 
by june  we had used substantially all of the proceeds to acquire communities 
therefore  we do not expect significant interest income in the future 
the average interest rate on our temporary investments was during both and interest expense interest expense increased in by  as compared to due to borrowings used to acquire manufactured home communities 
during  we incurred interest expense on approximately million assumed in connection with the acquisitions of four manufactured home communities and approximately million borrowed in mid in connection with the acquisition of four additional communities 
the interest expense figure also includes  of amortized loan costs related to the borrowings 
costs incurred to acquire management contract during  we achieved annualized returns before depreciation on certain of our real estate investments in excess of for a period of six months 
pursuant to the november acquisition of our management contract  we issued  op units to the former manager and recognized a  expense for additional consideration paid to the former manager 
during  we recognized  of expense related to the purchase of our management contract 
gain on restructuring of bonds in connection with the resecuritization of the non agency mbs bonds  a gain of  was recognized during reduced by both  of incentive fees related to the gain and an additional fee of  incurred in exchange for the manager agreeing to continue as a loss mitigation advisor on the non agency mbs bonds 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a transaction for the sale of interests in other bonds that had no carrying value on our books 
as a result of this transaction  a net gain of  was recognized in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental property and service operations from may through december  we invested million in manufactured home communities and related assets 
as of december   we had interests in manufactured home communities 
in  we earned  of rental and other property revenues and  of equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and incurred  of property operating expenses and  of depreciation related to the acquired communities 
in addition  we earned  of property management income less  of amortization related to the management contracts acquired 
equity in earnings of commercial assets income from our interest in commercial assets for and was  and  respectively 
commercial assets reported to us that the increase in income is primarily because of gains from the restructuring of its portfolio of collateralized mortgage backed securities cmbs bonds  prepayments on one of its cmbs bonds in the third quarter of and the non recurring charge in for the elimination of dividend equivalent rights under commercial assets stock option plan 
the increase was partially offset by higher management fees in and revenues from redemption of two cmbs bonds and other prepayments in non agency mbs bonds income from our non agency mbs bonds decreased to  during compared with  for primarily due to the resecuritization of the bonds in march revenues of  from the non agency mbs bonds  since the resecuritization  represent income from the retained equity interest 
management fees in november  stockholders approved a proposal to acquire our manager in order to become a self managed and self administered reit 
prior to the acquisition  the manager received various fees for the advisory and other services performed  and the manager provided all personnel and related overhead necessary to conduct our regular business 
management fees decreased to  during compared with  for primarily due to the resecuritization of the non agency mbs bonds in march the manager received administrative fees of up to  for each non agency mbs bond and base fees on invested assets 
base fees were not paid on cash or short term investment balances 
therefore  as a result of the resecuritization  administrative fees were eliminated  base fees declined  and lower net income exclusive of the gain on the restructuring resulted in lower incentive fees 
in addition  all fees were discontinued upon our acquisition of the manager in november we incurred  of acquisition fees during  relating to the acquisition of manufactured home communities and management contracts 
these acquisition fees are capitalized and will be amortized over the estimated life of the related assets 
no acquisition fees were incurred in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by  in compared with due primarily to the elimination of dividend equivalent right expense in the second quarter of  reductions in accounting and consulting fees  and lower costs associated with stockholder relations 
interest and other income interest and other income increased significantly during compared with because of higher cash balances subsequent to the resecuritization of the non agency mbs bonds 
the average interest rate on our cash investments during was 
interest expense interest expense during includes  on the secured notes payable assumed with the acquisition of four manufactured home communities and  of interest on the million of short term borrowings outstanding at december  the  of interest expense during was on short term borrowings 
costs incurred to acquire management contract during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a  nonrecurring expense related to our purchase of our management contract  including  of non cash expense from the issuance of op units to the former manager 
gain on restructuring of bonds the gains from the restructuring of non agency mbs and other bonds totaled  there were no such gains in nol and capital loss carryovers at december   our nol carryover was approximately  and our capital loss carryover was approximately  subject to some limitations  the nol carryover may be used to offset all or a portion of our reit income  and as a result  to reduce the amount of income that we must distribute to stockholders to maintain our status as a reit 
the nol carryover is scheduled to expire between and and the capital loss carryover is scheduled to expire in and dividend distributions during  we distributed  per share to holders of common stock and op units compared to distributions of  per share and distributions of  per share 
eighty percent of dividends and seventy five percent of dividends constituted return of capital distributions  which are not taxable to the stockholders to the extent of their basis in their stock 
return of capital distributions were not made in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  our principal activities that demand liquidity include our normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  acquisitions of or additional investments in properties  payments of dividends to stockholders and distributions made to limited partners in the operating partnership 
our net cash provided by operating activities was  during compared to  during the increase was primarily a result of increased cash flow from the ownership and management of manufactured home communities due to acquisitions in and offset by decreased cash flow from the non agency mbs bonds and short term investments we held in and costs in in the amount of  associated with the acquisition of our management contract 
in  the net cash used by investing activities was  compared with in which  of net cash was provided by investing activities 
investing activities in were primarily related to the acquisition of manufactured home communities  whereas  investing activities in primarily consisted of the restructuring of bonds net of the acquisition of interests in real estate 
the restructuring of bonds in provided  of cash  of which  was used to acquire interests in real estate 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared with net cash used by financing activities of  in this difference is primarily due to short term and long term borrowings in versus our repayment of short term borrowings in we have a line of credit with a bank which matures in september the line of credit is secured by  shares of our commercial assets common stock 
advances under this line of credit bear interest at the day libor rate plus 
the line of credit is limited to the lesser of  of the product of the trading price of commercial assets common stock times  or of the purchase price of certain unpledged real estate 
as of december   the limit was  and  was outstanding on this line of credit 
as of december   of our real estate and of our total assets were encumbered by debt 
we had total outstanding indebtedness of million  all of which was secured by various manufactured home communities  participating mortgages or shares of commercial assets stock 
our indebtedness was comprised of million of non recourse secured  long term financing and million of secured short term financing 
we expect to refinance the short term debt with non recourse secured  long term financing in as of december   none of the long term financing and all of the short term financing bears interest at variable rates 
the weighted average interest rate on the secured  long term notes payable was with a weighted average maturity of years 
the weighted average interest rate on our short term financing was 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through long term  secured borrowings  the issuance of op units and other equity securities and cash generated by operations 
funds from operations we measure our economic profitability based on ffo  less an annual capital replacement reserve of at least per developed homesite 
we believe that ffo  less a reserve  provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
the board of governors of nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with nareit s definition 
in our calculation we include adjustments for o the minority interest in the operating partnership owned by persons other than us  o costs we incurred in order to become self managed  and o amortization of management contracts 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
for and  our ffo was as follows in thousands income before minority interest in operating partnership  gain on liquidation of bonds  real estate depreciation  real estate depreciation in joint ventures amortization of management contracts  amortization of non agency mbs bonds  equity in commercial assets adjustments for ffo  costs incurred to acquire management contract   funds from operations ffo   weighted average common shares and op units outstanding   year compliance year issues have arisen because many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the following disclosure provides information regarding the current status of our year compliance program 
our critical hardware and software systems are currently year compliant 
upon failure of any system  data included in critical software such as rent rolls and certain record keeping systems could be transferred to alternative commercially available software at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time period 
consequently  we would be able to continue our business operations without any material interruption or material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we anticipate that any hardware or software that we acquire including upgrades to existing systems between now and december  will be year compliant 
disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
moreover  because a large number of our tenants may be dependent on social security payments to pay their rents  a failure of the social security administration to cause their systems to be year compliant may result in a material adverse effect on our operations 
the social security administration has announced that they will have their systems year compliant before january  we believe that the cost of modification or replacement of our less essential accounting and reporting software and hardware that is not currently compliant with year requirements  if any  will not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk is through our various debt instruments and borrowings 
the following is a list of these debt instruments and borrowing arrangements 
we have million of non recourse  secured long term notes payable that mature in we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on these notes as the rate is fixed and the notes are fully amortizing 
we have million of non recourse  secured long term notes payable that mature in october with a principal payment at maturity of million 
the rates on these notes range from to and are fixed 
we intend to refinance these notes during or with long term  fully amortizing  fixed rate debt 
while changes in interest rates would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future to refinance the existing debt  we believe that the effect  if any  of near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would not be material as the existing debt is fixed rate until october we have million of recourse  secured short term financing that bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
we expect to refinance this debt with non recourse  secured  fixed rate  long term debt in we have loan commitments from a lender for amounts in excess of the existing loan amount for year  fully amortized debt with fixed rates ranging from to 
if such expected refinancing occurs  we would not have significant exposure to changing interest rates 
if the loan is not refinanced with fixed rate  fully amortized debt  then changes in libor would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future 
we have a recourse  secured line of credit that bears interest at libor plus 
as of december   the outstanding balance was million 
accordingly  changes in libor would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future  however  its affect would not be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
