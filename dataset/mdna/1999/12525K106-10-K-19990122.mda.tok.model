item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cfm technologies  inc designs  manufactures and markets advanced wet processing equipment for sale to the worldwide semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing industries 
the company was founded in and began commercial operations in following a period of technology and product development  during which time the company s patented full flow enclosed processing and direct displacement drying technologies were developed 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of its systems  recent sales of which have ranged in price from approximately million to million 
as of october   the company had shipped over systems to more than semiconductor manufacturers worldwide 
during fiscal  the company s net sales declined significantly and the company realized a net loss as a result of excess production capacity throughout the semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries 
prior to fiscal  the company had been undergoing a period of rapid growth with net sales during fiscal increasing by over net sales for fiscal net sales of full flow systems to companies in the fpd manufacturing industry represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the company believes that capital expenditures in the fpd manufacturing industry will continue to be subject to significant variations and expects that its fpd sales as a percentage of total sales will continue to fluctuate as the company evaluates the best strategy for serving this highly cyclical market 
the company believes that fpd full flow system sales will continue to be a small portion of total sales during fiscal the company sells its systems worldwide and records a significant portion of its sales to customers outside the united states 
in fiscal  international sales constituted of net sales  down from in fiscal sales to customers in asia represented and of total sales in fiscal and  respectively 
beginning in the fall of and throughout  the currencies and economies of certain asian countries  including korea  were under pressure 
some of these asian countries subsequently experienced changes in currency valuation  received external financial support and agreed to certain economic reorganization programs anticipated to reduce growth and credit demand 
early in fiscal  the company experienced an order cancellation and the postponement of other orders 
additionally  early in fiscal  the company received requests from certain customers in asia for adjustments in payment terms on some existing accounts receivable 
some accommodations in payment terms were granted to these customers and  subject to certain legal limitations  these terms have been and continue to be met 
at october   accounts receivable from customers in asia comprised of all accounts receivable 
approximately one half of these asian accounts receivable were the result of shipments made during october the company reduced its staff during march by employees or of the workforce 
another reduction of employees or of the workforce occurred in july during this period  the company took additional steps to reduce expenses through the elimination of discretionary spending and the curtailment of capital investments not related to immediate business opportunities or contractual obligations 
the company adopted a strategy of continued investment in new product and process development and the retention of field and customer support personnel necessary to improve customer satisfaction 
the significant decline in overall demand for the company s products in the global marketplace resulted in significant losses 
future results will depend upon a variety of factors  including the timing of significant orders  the ability of the company to bring new systems to market  the timing of new product releases by the company s competitors  the timing of a recovery from the current downturn in capital spending by the company s customers  the impact of economic controls in countries where the company does business  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s systems  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors and the volatility of the semiconductor and fpd industries and of the markets served by the company s customers 
the company s gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including temporary underabsorption of manufacturing overhead and fixed costs  the mix and average selling prices of systems and the mix of sales to domestic and international markets 
the company pays significant commissions and service and support fees to agents on sales in east asia 
as a result  gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales have in the past and will continue in the future to fluctuate based to a large extent on changes in the proportion of net sales in east asia 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of the company s statements of operations for the fiscal years ended october   and  expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended october  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense  net 
income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit 
net income loss net sales 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and then decreased to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from increased demand for the company s full flow systems by companies in the semiconductor and fpd industries as the company s customers equipped new facilities or expanded facilities  resulting in multiple systems purchases by some of the company s major customers  and initial sales to new customers 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction in overall demand for semiconductor and fpd manufacturing equipment as semiconductor and fpd device manufacturers curtailed expansion plans because of industry wide overcapacity 
net sales for fiscal  and included sales of full flow systems to companies in the fpd manufacturing industry representing approximately  and  of net sales  respectively 
the company believes that capital expenditures in the fpd manufacturing industry are subject to significant variations and expects that its fpd sales as a percentage of total sales will continue to fluctuate as the company evaluates the best strategy for serving this highly cyclical market 
sales of fpd full flow systems to lg semiconductor  a manufacturer located in korea  represented of all fpd sales during fiscal the company believes that fpd full flow system sales will continue to represent a small portion of net sales during fiscal international sales represented  and of total net sales  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the number of international customers receiving shipments of the company s systems increased in both fiscal and the company expects international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of its net sales as a result of continuing expansion of its international sales  service and support organization 
for a description of recent economic events in asian countries and their effects on the company  see overview 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained substantially constant at in fiscal compared with in fiscal the level of gross profit in fiscal and fiscal can be attributed to a mix of increases in sales prices  changes in product mix  reductions in the cost of component parts due to volume and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from increased volume and the expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities 
gross margin in fiscal declined significantly to as a result of underabsorption of manufacturing overhead and fixed costs because of low production levels 
research  development and engineering 
research  development and engineering expenses increased from million or of net sales in fiscal to million or of net sales in fiscal and further increased to million or of net sales in fiscal the substantial increase in research  development and engineering spending in fiscal is attributable to the development of a much larger full flow fpd system which was first delivered in june during fiscal  the company completed development of a version of the full flow platform to process mm semiconductor wafers and entered into a joint development agreement with semiconductor a joint venture of siemens and motorola  delivering a dual vessel mm system in april additionally  during fiscal  the company developed new processes utilizing the full flow platform to perform critical cleaning steps prior to the deposition of hemispherical grain or epitaxial silicon  to enable in situ creation of variable concentration buffered hydrogen fluoride etchant and to control the concentration of gasses dissolved in processing fluids used within the full flow system 
the company believes that continued substantial investment in research  development and engineering is critical to maintaining a strong technological position and  therefore  competitive position and accordingly expects such expenses in fiscal will continue at approximately the fiscal level 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million or of net sales in fiscal to million or of net sales in fiscal and decreased to million or of net sales in fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from increases in sales and marketing costs related to increased customer support and increased international sales  as well as legal expenses related to litigation undertaken to protect one of the company s patents 
the decrease in fiscal resulted from a reduction of staff and a significant curtailment in discretionary spending offset by increased costs of patent litigation 
see  part i  item  legal proceedings 
the company believes that  subject to improved demand in the markets which the company serves  selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal and beyond  as increased personnel and sales and support expenses are anticipated in connection with the company s efforts to increase its net sales and as the company continues to invest in developing and protecting its patents and other intellectual property rights 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  of million in fiscal represented of net sales 
in fiscal and  interest income  net of interest expense  was million or of net sales and million or of net sales  respectively 
the company incurred interest expenses due to intra period borrowings on its revolving line of credit during fiscal which borrowings were utilized to support the company s increased working capital requirements 
in fiscal and  net interest income was earned as a result of the investment of funds not immediately required for the company s operations which were available as a result of the company s initial public offering in june and a follow on offering in february net interest income declined in fiscal as a result of lower invested balances and lower interest rates during the year 
income tax provision benefit 
the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the rate for fiscal reflects the unavailability of research and development tax credits and limited tax benefit from the company s foreign sales corporation as a result of the company s export sales 
the rate for fiscal reflected tax benefits from a reinstitution of the research and development tax credit along with significant tax benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation 
during fiscal the tax benefit recorded was at an effective rate of 
the income tax benefit effective rate increased from the prior year rates primarily due to the absence of any tax impact from the company s foreign sales corporation based on the loss incurred for fiscal approximately million of the income tax benefit will be realized from refunds due from the carryback of current losses to prior years tax returns and the remainder of the benefit is recorded as a deferred tax asset 
based on an assessment of the company s taxable earnings history and expected future taxable income  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
the company may be required to provide a valuation allowance for this asset in the future if it does not generate sufficient taxable income as planned 
additionally  the ultimate realization of this asset could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has funded its capital requirements through funding from two research and development limited partnerships  the private sale of equity securities  the company s initial public offering of common stock completed in june  a follow on offering of common stock completed in february and  to a lesser extent  bank borrowings and equipment leases 
as of october   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in working capital 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal the company had a net loss in fiscal of million compared to net income in of million 
accounts receivable increased million in fiscal and decreased million in fiscal inventories increased by million during fiscal and decreased by million during fiscal during fiscal  accounts receivable increased due to higher revenues and customer payment delays resulting from additional review on initial sales of production systems by customer production personnel prior to payment 
this review is sometimes time consuming and precedes receipt of the final payment amount negotiated as a part of the original purchase agreement 
subsequent deliveries of similar products usually result in significantly more rapid collection of final amounts owed 
a similar situation can occur with initial installations at new customer sites as personnel unfamiliar with full flow systems receive training 
accounts receivable decreased during fiscal as sales volume declined and existing accounts were collected 
accounts receivable balances are expected to continue to fluctuate with the volume of shipments of certain products and of products to new customer sites 
purchases of property  plant and equipment were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  these expenditures were primarily related to improvements in information systems infrastructure  expansion of the company s applications laboratory  additional customer and employee training facilities and expanded production capacity 
in fiscal  these expenditures primarily were for continued investment in the company s applications laboratory and improvements to leased facilities to be occupied by the company during fiscal during fiscal  the company leased an additional  square feet of space in a facility in the same industrial park as its owned manufacturing and leased administrative facilities to house a portion of the company s production operations and its customer satisfaction function 
during fiscal  the leased premises were reduced to  square feet  which will be vacated in march during fiscal  the company also entered into a lease with a minimum term of years for two new facilities  a  square foot production facility and an  square foot office facility 
the production facility was recently completed and the office facility is presently under construction in exton  pennsylvania  approximately seven miles from the site of the company s current operations 
rentals on the production facility began in october and rentals on the office facility are expected to begin by mid during fiscal  the company leased  square feet of temporary prototype laboratory and storage facility which will be vacated during fiscal the company intends to retain its owned facility in west chester  pennsylvania for use in manufacturing  customer and employee training and research and development while moving all other functions to exton during fiscal the company has a relationship with a commercial bank which includes a mortgage on the company s manufacturing facility in the amount of million and a million revolving demand line of credit 
the mortgage bears interest at an annual rate of 
the line of credit is unsecured and borrowings are at an interest rate equal to such bank s prime rate 
there were no borrowings outstanding at october  the company also has mortgage notes payable to the pennsylvania industrial development authority in the amount of million bearing interest at and to the chester county development council in the amount of million bearing interest at 
in addition  the company has outstanding capital lease obligations in the amount of million bearing interest at rates ranging from to per annum 
the company had outstanding accounts receivable of approximately million and million as of october  and  respectively 
no allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has been recorded as the company believes that all such accounts receivable are fully realizable 
the company believes that existing cash balances and its available line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements through the next twelve months 
however  depending upon its rate of growth and profitability  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to meet its working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if needed  will be available when required  or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
the discussions above regarding the company s expectations of future sales  gross profits  research  development and engineering expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  use of deferred tax assets  product introductions and cash requirements include certain forward looking statements on these subjects 
as such  actual results may vary materially from such expectations 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include variations in the level of orders  which can be affected by general economic conditions and growth rates in specific geographic areas where the company may have a concentration of business  in the semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries and in the markets served by the company s customers  the international economic and political climates  difficulties or delays in product functionality or performance  the delivery performance of sole source vendors  the timing of future product releases  failure to respond adequately to either changes in technology or customer preferences  changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  ability to manage growth  risks of non payment of accounts receivable  changes in budgeted costs or failure to realize a successful outcome to pending patent litigation  all of which constitute significant risks 
there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be adversely affected by one of more of these factors 
year at midnight on december   all computer systems that use two digits to represent the year are at risk of malfunction or failure 
many systems will continue to run  but may interpret any date in the year to be prior to any date in the year  posing potential data comparison problems  or may fail to recognize that the year  unlike  is a leap year 
businesses and systems that use a four digit format to report and process dates later than december  are often denoted as year compliant 
while many systems have no date comparison functions and operate in a date independent mode  they may have a date function 
if full system operation and correct display of dates subsequent to january  are possible  these systems may be denoted as year operationally ready 
many systems and subsystems using two digit dates will operate smoothly until the end of their technological or economic life without regard to the actual date 
these systems are unaffected by whether it is or  make no real time date comparisons and have no date display features 
at the other extreme are systems which will cease functioning or malfunction when an unacceptable date is perceived which in some cases could be during 
the company is committed to the operation of its business and the operation of its products without interruption 
certain changes in the company s operating procedures may be needed to reduce risks or avoid complications relating to the year issue to ensure that the company and its customers will not be negatively impacted by year issues 
the company s chief financial officer  has been selected by the company s senior management as the coordinator for the company s year compliance efforts 
a team has been formed with active participation by the information systems  purchasing  software engineering  marketing and customer services departments and has been working since to enable the company to meet its year goals 
the company views year issues in four categories of potential exposure products this encompasses the company s products offered for sale and the products that are currently in service at customer sites 
business applications and infrastructure this includes all client server  desktop and network hardware and software used in routine business operations 
business relationships and third parties this includes the supply chain for the company s products  customers and service providers  including banks  insurance companies  payroll and pension plan administrators  legal  accounting and consulting firms  as well as public utilities  long distance telecommunications providers  transportation and overnight delivery companies and local government services 
non information technology non it this includes embedded microprocessors used in building facilities  manufacturing equipment and systems and control systems and instrumentation 
state of readiness products the company believes it is aware of the potential year exposure of its full flow wet processing systems currently in production at customer sites or of models available for sale 
the company has made an assessment of its exposure using the sematech year readiness testing standard as the basis for its assessment 
this standard is one of two standards used by the semiconductor equipment industry for assessing the year readiness of the industry s equipment 
based on an assessment under this standard  the company s current products available for sale and those shipped in the past year  with respect to both hardware and software  are considered to be ready now 
systems shipped earlier will obtain the ready now standard once the on board computer system date is reset at the beginning of the new millenium 
while the products are ready now based on industry standards  customers may also elect to have their on board computer systems upgraded  for a fee  to be in technical compliance four digit date representation 
this upgrade is unnecessary in order to obtain full functional operation 
the company has successfully completed year testing on a representative cross section of its products in production at a customer site 
while the company believes it has undertaken all needed assessment  validation and implementation of product related year issues  it intends to continue to search for any as yet unforeseen issues and develop action plans to resolve such issues 
the company maintains a website  available to its customers  that discusses year issues related to its products including detailed testing results 
business applications and infrastructure the company has completed an assessment of all of its internally used business applications software and the hardware on which such applications run 
this assessment was conducted primarily by contacting developers of the systems and manufacturers of the hardware and obtaining statements regarding the year readiness of the software and hardware presently in use 
the primary enterprise wide system used for business operations  including order processing  systems design and documentation  procurement  manufacturing and accounting has been described as year compliant by the manufacturer 
the underlying hardware and operating system that the enterprise wide system runs on are also compliant  as described by their respective manufacturers 
desktop computers in use throughout the company vary in their year compliance for both hardware and software 
while the majority of the hardware is compliant  most of the non compliant hardware may be upgraded with software from the manufacturer available free over the internet 
the company intends to perform such upgrades by the end of june the company has a few non compliant machines that cannot be upgraded which are not currently in use for any date comparison functions  and which it may elect to replace at a cost of approximately  the company is implementing year compliant desktop software and expects to have all computers using a date comparison function upgraded by september at a cost to the company of approximately  year compliant network server software is expected to be made available early in by the manufacturer at an upgrade cost of approximately  the company intends to implement the upgrades to its server software by june business relationships and third parties the company has had varying success in assessing the year readiness of companies with which it has business relationships 
in each case  the company has either contacted its vendors  customers or service providers or searched their websites for information regarding year compliance 
while the company has received statements from many in this group  it has not yet obtained certification statements from certain critical vendors 
many of the statements received  including those from public utilities  stated intentions to become compliant during the company is pursuing additional discussions with critical vendors to assess the potential impact  if any  on its operations 
non it a special effort has been made to identify embedded microprocessors with date functions in any part  assembly  subsystem or oem component used in or distributed in conjunction with the company s products 
no such embedded microprocessors have been discovered to date 
non it embedded microprocessors may also be present in elevators  heating and air conditioning systems  telecommunications devices and manufacturing equipment 
costs to address year issues costs to address year issues have primarily been incurred internally 
as the company does not have a project tracking system  past and future year costs can only be estimated 
past costs are estimated to be  and future costs for internal labor are expected to be approximately  costs to replace desktop computers are estimated to be  software upgrades for the desktop computers are estimated to be  and the upgrade to network server software is estimated to be  the new telecommunications equipment  heating and air conditioning systems  and elevators in the new facilities in exton  pa are the result of moving to newly built facilities and not a result of year issues 
there may be additional costs incurred for unforeseen year issues 
all costs will be funded out of general operating funds and are not expected to be material 
risks of the company s year issues although not expected  the most likely worst case scenario includes the inability of vendors to supply product on a timely basis and the inability of customers to take delivery of currently ordered equipment  order more equipment or to pay the company for products already purchased 
management will  in conjunction with its customers  continue to evaluate currently identified and as yet unforeseen potential year issues in its products that could adversely affect customers production capabilities 
commercially available software capable of finding date comparison programs and databases on desktop computers will be executed to minimize the risk of date comparison errors 
the company will continue to seek readiness certification from critical suppliers and customers 
contingency plans the company is currently seeking alternate suppliers or obtaining in house capabilities for vendors that it deems to be both critical to the company s success and unable to adequately demonstrate year readiness 
as a part of the company s continuing customer service efforts  the company is working with its customers to encourage year testing that includes the company s products 
the current status of the company s efforts to deal with year issues has been posted on the company s internet site which may be viewed at http www 
cfmtech 
com 
there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in technology used in its products or internal systems  which are comprised predominantly of third party software and hardware  or by the inability of third parties to adequately disclose and correct their year issues 
while the company presently believes that the ultimate outcome of its efforts to be year ready will not have a material effect on the company s financial position liquidity or operations  there can be no assurances that unanticipated increased costs could have a material effect on the results of operations
