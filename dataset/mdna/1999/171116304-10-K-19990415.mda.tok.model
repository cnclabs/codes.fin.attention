overview the company was formed in to research and develop and to commercialize certain intellectual property rights  proprietary technology and instrumentation in the field of color science collectively  the intellectual properties for marketing to a variety of industries  including  but not limited to  the medical  dental  biological  cosmetic  hair color  beauty aid and fashion industries 
the intellectual properties relate to the application of color science technology to the scientific measurement and analysis of human skin  tissue  fluid  hair  teeth or biological subject  the classification of such measurements  the detection and monitoring of conditions affecting the coloration of such human skin  tissue  fluid  hair  teeth or biological subjects and the scientific classification and color oriented organization of various consumer sensitive products such as cosmetics  tooth enamel  hair color  hosiery  fashion  textiles  etc 
the company has incorporated certain of the intellectual properties into a proprietary color measurement system and software marketed for various commercial applications as the colormate registered system the colormate registered system 
the company has developed intellectual properties which it believes are capable of detecting and monitoring certain chromogenic diseases and disorders  which are defined by the company as those which are diagnosed or monitored by the coloration of human skin  tissue or fluid being affected chromogenic diseases 
in this regard  the company developed the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system to measure the incremental change of the yellow content of the skin color in newborns to monitor newborn bilirubinemia infant jaundice 
on july   the company received us food and drug administration fda clearance for commercial marketing of the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system for the non invasive monitoring of newborn bilirubinemia infant jaundice by health care professionals in hospitals  pediatricians offices or by home healthcare agencies colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system 
the company s efforts are currently focused on successfully commercializing this medical application of its intellectual properties for non invasive monitoring of newborn bilirubinemia infant jaundice 
see risk factors 
the company also has developed its own line of scientifically color coordinated proprietary cosmetics my colors by chromatics trademark and scientifically color coordinated proprietary color charts and material swatchpacks for use in the cosmetics  beauty  dental and fashion industries 
the company s colormate registered system products  cosmetic line and material swatchpacks for the cosmetic  beauty and fashion industries are referred to herein collectively as the beauty aid products 
the company s marketing activities have principally involved licensing the intellectual properties  including conducting laboratory product chromaticity studies chromaticity studies  leasing the colormate registered system and marketing the beauty aid products  all in the cosmetic  hair color  beauty aid and fashion industries i in a national sales program the avon project with avon products  inc avon  and in limited test markets with clairol  inc clairol and hanes hosiery  inc 
hanes  all conducted prior to june  and ii under a current agreement with gordon laboratories  inc gordon laboratories and under certain leases and licenses to beauty related businesses and beauty salons 
although the company from time to time has been engaged in preliminary discussions including limited consumer testing and laboratory chromaticity study activities for use of its technology in the cosmetics  dental and beauty aid fields  there can be no assurance that any final agreements will be reached 
in this regard  the company has completed research and development for the working prototype of a hand held less expensive light emitting diode led model of the colormate registered system the colormate registered led device which the company anticipates may enhance its marketing efforts in these fields 
in  the company furthered implementation of its long range plans to exploit certain medical applications for its technology 
in this regard  the company submitted a marketing application for its colormate registered unit for a certain medical application with the fda on november  the application  known as a premarket notification or k submission  was accepted officially for filing and review by the fda on november  the application requested  and on july   the company received from the fda s center for devices and radiological health cdrh  marketing clearance pursuant to a substantial equivalence determination order  in the form of a letter dated july   authorizing the company to commercially distribute its colormate registered bilirubin device for non invasive detection and monitoring of newborn bilirubinemia infant jaundice by healthcare professionals 
the substantial equivalence order states that the company must comply with the medical device general controls  eg  device establishment registration  medical device listing  good manufacturing practices quality system regulation qsr  labeling  and the statutory prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding 
the order also states that the colormate registered transcutaneous bilirubinometer is a class ii device which may be subject to additional special controls 
the company intends to maintain compliance with any applicable general controls and special controls for purposes of commercial distribution but there can be no assurance it will be able to do so 
see risk factors 
in  the company took significant steps to implement its business plan for medical applications  including expansion of the multicenter hospital studies of the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system to three new institutions  participation in a number of united states and international presentations of the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system to the medical community  and the opening of a medical marketing  sales  distribution and training support division 
the company also entered into exclusive manufacturing arrangements for the production of the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system 
following the positive response to the device from the medical community  the company arranged for the mass manufacture of the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system  and in february began shipping the device together with the tlc lensette  the disposable calibration standard to us hospitals and physicians and conducting inservicing and training of clinicians through the company s new medical support division 
see proposed marketing plan and manufacturing 
in september  the company entered into a lease and license agreement with nordstrom  inc nordstrom granting nordstrom a license to use the colormate registered system to formulate and recommend nordstrom s co color to order line of proprietary cosmetic products in four nordstrom flagship department stores 
the products will be introduced and evaluated over a three month period commencing upon delivery of packaging materials from nordstrom and final cosmetic formulations for potential extended use  including additional store locations 
in connection with this license agreement  the company is collaborating with a consultant to provide training  marketing  sales  promotional and liaison services including assisting in development of all applicable non color product formulas  manuals  promotional materials and training aids at each of the four nordstrom s stores 
in april  the company raised gross proceeds of million from the private placement of senior convertible debentures due april   the proceeds of which the company intends to use to support its marketing efforts and obligations under the arrangements with the marketing and distribution partner selected 
since inception the company has financed its operations through i private placements of its securities  ii collaborative research and development arrangements with licensees  iii cash receipts from lease and licensing agreements  iv loans from private investors and certain shareholders  v the february initial public offering the ipo and vi the proceeds of exercise of stock options and warrants 
over the past two years  the company has used substantial portions of the proceeds of such exercise  and proceeds from the private placement in and of its securities  to further its long range business plan with respect to the medical application of its technologies and for the development and commercialization of the colormate registered units  including a transcutaneous bilirubinometer 
the company has incurred significant research and development and marketing expenses since inception  resulting in losses from operations since and  prior to its ipo  negative shareholders equity 
in particular  over the past two years  the company has incurred significant fda related expenses  research and development expenses and marketing start up expenses relating to the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system and research and development expenses related to the colormate registered led device 
the company also has not achieved significant operating revenues from marketing its intellectual properties  beauty aid products and colormate registered units in the cosmetic and beauty aid industries since termination of the avon project in  and has generated limited revenue from licensing its intellectual properties or the colormate registered system in any industry other than the cosmetics  haircolor  beauty aid and fashion industries 
see note of notes to financial statements and risk factors 
since limited revenues have been derived from licenses  leases  service contracts and beauty aid product sales to several beauty related businesses  testing and laboratory fees from potential licensees evaluating the company s technology  and from an exclusive licensing and lease contract with ims cosmetics  inc ims 
in and the first three quarters of  the company did not generate any lease  license and service contract revenues from ims 
to the extent the company receives payments from licensees  distributors or other sources  such payments may occur at various times during the year 
accordingly  these payments have had  and payments that may be received in the future will have  a significant impact on quarter to quarter comparisons inasmuch as the company has not developed stable sources of repeat revenues 
from december  until the ipo  the company had been primarily engaged in a pursuing the company s litigation against avon  b developing and testing further applications of the intellectual properties and colormate registered units  such as the clinical research studies for medical applications  and c obtaining additional financing to support marketing of the company s intellectual properties  systems  beauty aid products and related services 
the company s ability to generate revenues in the future will depend on its success in marketing its intellectual properties  the related chromaticity studies capabilities  the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system  the colormate registered units and the beauty aid products 
in addition  the company s future ability to generate revenues from its technologies and its colormate registered units will depend on  among other things  the company s ability to establish and maintain marketing  distribution and manufacturing arrangements with third parties 
if these efforts are not successful in the future  the principal effect would be a write down of the book value of the colormate registered units and an impairment of the company s ability to obtain future financing  which could result in diminution in the value of an investment in the company 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to establish such arrangements  timely place such units or identify alternative markets

results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company incurred net losses of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  as revenues received have not been significant relative to the company s expenses incurred in implementing its business plan 
the  increase in such losses in as compared to is primarily attributable to the company s continuing implementation of its long range business plan to seek commercial applications of its intellectual properties and technologies in the medical field  including an increase in costs and expenses regarding consultants compensation  legal expenses incurred in respect of the company s negotiations with its medical device manufacturer and potential distribution partners  the recent litigation and matters related to the short selling activities in the company s stock  and legal  consulting and other related expenses regarding regulatory compliance with respect to manufacturing and other requirements for the company s colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system  sales  marketing and trade show expenses  primarily attributable to the company s presentations at the annual convention of the pediatric academic societies  the sinomed conference in china  the international congress of pediatrics  the national association of neonatal nurses  the american academy of pediatrics and the th annual pediatric critical care medicine conference in china  option grants  public relations and promotions  and contributions to the new employee benefit plan 
these increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease in patent application costs  as the company has begun capitalizing certain of these expenses in the company incurred research and development expenses primarily consisting of compensation of officers  employees and consultants of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
although the company anticipates that the future expenses regarding fda application costs and related patent application costs should be significantly less than amounts incurred prior to receipt of the initial fda marketing clearance  the company will continue to incur significant additional costs and expenses in connection with fda manufacturing and other regulations  state regulatory requirements and foreign market clearances and other requirements 
additional expenses are anticipated in connection with certain international multicenter studies being conducted on the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system 
see business 
in addition  the company expects to incur significant expenses relating to manufacturing expenses  products liability insurance  legal and regulatory compliance  including qsr gmp quality system substantial compliance  as well as research and development for new potential applications  and implementation of the next phase of its efforts to successfully commercialize the medical application of its technology 
the company also anticipates significantly higher compensation expenses in connection with increased hiring to staff its medical division 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
the company will also incur additional expenses implementing additional testing and clinical trials of its technologies for the possible monitoring of other chromogenic diseases 
further  the company anticipates significantly higher legal expenses in connection with its defense of certain class action suits that have been brought against the company and as the company explores all of its potential legal remedies 
see legal proceedings 
in  the company focused its resources on implementation of its long range business plan for the fda medical application of its technologies and received no revenues from operations 
the company believes the absence of sales in was also attributable to ongoing delays in manufacturing certain color shades of the company s new line of cosmetic products for its colormate registered system which delays were attributable to finalizing color formulations 
under the nordstrom agreement  the company anticipates the new cosmetics will be ready to market upon delivery of packaging materials from nordstrom and final cosmetic formulations 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur substantial and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future as increased expenses are incurred in implementing its long range business plan for the medical application of its technologies and as revenues from the cosmetics  beauty aid and fashion areas are anticipated to continue to be insignificant relative to the company s anticipated expenses in the foreseeable future 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company incurred net losses of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively  as revenues received have not been significant relative to the company s expenses incurred in implementing its business plan 
the  increase in such losses in as compared to is primarily attributable to expenses incurred in in respect of increased patent applications costs  write offs of certain inventory  non cash expenses relating to the grant of options to consultants  and increased research and development expense 
the company incurred research and development expenses primarily consisting of compensation of officers  employees and consultants of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
the loss was mitigated by the capitalization of  of software development costs  decreased fda medical application costs  and a decrease in other expenses described below 
see note of notes to financial statements for a discussion of the effect on net losses and net losses per share attributable to i the company s outstanding convertible securities and ii accounting for stock based compensation on the intrinsic value method  rather than the fair market value method 
the company believes that the level of expenses relating to the fda initial application and related patent applications will not be recurring in the future at previous levels and that any future expenses incurred in connection therewith will be significantly less than the amount incurred in  although no assurance can be given of such result 
bad debt expense decreased to  in from  in primarily attributable to the adjustment of amounts due from ims in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  in from  in  primarily attributable to the amortization of deferred legal expenses incurred in in respect of financing activities 
compensation expense for employees  officers and directors decreased to  in from  in  primarily attributable to increased use of consultants

see notes and of notes to financial statements 
revenues from lease  license and service contracts decreased in as the company continued to focus its resources on implementation of its long range business plan for the medical application of its technologies 
the company receives payments from licensees  distributors or other sources sporadically during the year 
accordingly  these payments have had  and payments that may be received in the future will have  a significant impact on quarter to quarter comparisons inasmuch as the company has not developed stable recurring revenues 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur substantial and increasing net losses for the foreseeable future as increased expenses are incurred in implementing its long range business plan for the medical application of its technologies and as revenues from the company s existing activities in the cosmetics  beauty aid and fashion areas are anticipated to continue to be insignificant relative to its anticipated expenses in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year compared to fiscal year current assets decreased to  at december  as compared to  at december   primarily attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the loss incurred in and the purchase of equipment and component parts in respect of future manufacturing and sales and costs relating to patents and software 
as indicated in the company s statements of cash flows  the company continued to experience significant negative net cash flows from operating and investing activities in the increase in cash outflows from operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in the company s net loss  offset by an increase in non cash compensation costs to consultants 
cash flows from investing activities during of  are attributable to software development costs of  patent costs of  purchases of property and equipment of  and purchases and deposits on colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark units of  the increase is primarily a result of the company s rollout of its colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system 
cash flows from financing activities during principally represent  from the issuance of common stock net of related costs representing the receipt of proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
although the company anticipates that penetration of the medical marketplace will be through establishing relationships with specialized distributors  rather than through a direct sales force  the company has established a medical division to support its own efforts to initially market and distribute the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system  and to support training  technical and marketing efforts once the company enters into distribution agreements 
see proposed marketing plan  recent events and risk factors 
management believes that if its proposed marketing plans for nonmedical applications of its technology are successful  then it will generate revenues from fees from the licensing of the intellectual properties and leasing of the colormate registered units  consulting fees  and sales of cosmetics  although there can be no prediction or assurance as to which  or whether any  of these potential revenue sources will be successful 
in  such licensing  leasing and sales yielded limited revenue  primarily because the company devoted its resources to the commercialization of its technologies for medical application and because the company s new cosmetics line was not yet available 
the company anticipates incurring significant additional expenditures related to manufacturing expenses  parts order  insurance  regulatory compliance and staffing and marketing expenses for the sales division as production and distribution continues 
further  the company anticipates significantly higher legal expenses in connection with its defense of certain class action suits that have been brought against the company and as the company explores all of its potential legal remedies 
management expects that taking into account existing resources  anticipated revenues from future sales of the colormate registered units  anticipated payments received under distribution agreements and or the proceeds of the debentures and any additional financing  the company will have sufficient liquidity at least until december   although there can be no assurance of such result 
if the company is able to profitably market its intellectual properties  colormate registered units and beauty aid products  the company would use any cash flow obtained from operations  and may seek additional debt or equity financing  to further support and expand its operations 
the company s colormate registered units will be marketed interchangeably as the only differences between the different models are design and power supply improvements and software systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding 
if the company is not able to attract additional future financing  enter into a distribution agreement generating such payments  generate significant revenue from operations and or successfully market its products and technologies  at such point in time  it may have to significantly curtail and or cease operations 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year in  the company continued to experience significant negative net cash flows from operating activities 
net cash out flows from operating activities increased by  in as compared to  primarily due to the increase in net loss in and the non cash expense of options granted to consultants 
cash flows from financing activities increased to  from  in as compared to  primarily attributable to  proceeds from the exercise of warrants 
the company has applied a substantial portion of the proceeds of the private placement and debenture financing to continue its implementation of its long range business plan for commercialization of its technologies for medical applications in diagnosing certain diseases  including the completion of the fda application and the related patent applications 
in this regard  the company hired fda and governmental regulatory consultants in addition to legal counsel to assist in obtaining marketing regulatory clearances for such medical applications and is currently applying for foreign regulatory approvals of commercial use of its technology for the detection and monitoring of bilirubin infant jaundice 

the company anticipates that any initial penetration of the medical marketplace will be accomplished through the relationships with specialized distributors  rather than through a direct sales force 
management believes that  if its proposed marketing plans for non medical applications of its technology are successful  then it will generate revenues from fees from the licensing of the intellectual properties and leasing of the colormate registered units  sales of swatch packs  consulting fees  and sales of cosmetics  although there can be no prediction or assurance as to which or any of these potential revenue sources will be successful 
however  since consummation of the ipo  the company s marketing of its intellectual properties  beauty aid products and colormate registered units in the beauty aid industry have resulted in immaterial revenues 
as of december   management expects that the company will have sufficient liquidity at least until december   even if no revenues from operations are generated 
if the company is able to profitably market its intellectual properties  the colormate registered units  the colormate registered tlc bilitest trademark system and beauty aid products  the company would use any cash flow obtained from operations  and may seek additional debt or equity financing  to further support and expand its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding 
if the company has not been able to attract additional future financing at such point in time it may have to cease operations 
year until recently computer programs were generally written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
accordingly  such programs may be unable to distinguish properly between the year and the year this could result in system failures or data corruption for the company or its vendors which could cause disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in business activities or to receive information  services or payment from vendors 
the company s internal computing systems are primarily limited to hardware and software for its financial systems  such as general ledger and accounts receivable and payable systems  and word processing and database systems 
the company is not dependent on large legacy systems and does not use mainframes 
the company s management is continuing to conduct an assessment of the company s operations from an internal  vendor and customer perspective 
the assessment addresses all of the company s material computer systems  applications and any other material systems that the company believes may be vulnerable to the year issue and significantly affect the company s operations 
this assessment includes contacting third parties with whom the company has a material relationship to determine their year readiness 
the company s assessment is not yet complete and there can be no assurances that any such problems will not arise 
the total costs associated with the company s year compliance are not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
however  satisfactory remediation of year issues is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
the company s current estimates of the impact of year compliance on its financial position do not include costs that may result from the failure of third parties with whom the company has a material relationship to be year compliant 
should the company s internal systems or systems of one or more significant third parties fail to achieve year compliance  the company s business and its operations could be materially adversely affected
