item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  and the related notes to financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we can not guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information of known facts and trends 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase shareholder value by economically increasing reserves  production  and cash flow on an annual basis 
at the same time  we believe it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet by keeping our total debt at a manageable level 
we will balance our capital expenditures  financed primarily by operating cash flow and bank debt  among exploration  development  and acquisitions 
proved oil and gas reserves at december   were million barrels of oil and bcf of gas compared to million barrels of oil and bcf of gas at december  these results amount to a increase in gas reserves and a growth in total barrels of oil equivalents 
we replaced of our total production  based on barrels of oil equivalent 
during the last two years  we have concentrated on reducing our costs and expenses so as to be in line with our industry peers 
in addition  we have made an effort to end the litigation that has characterized this company for much of our history 
since  we have had a long term contract covering gas sales from south pass block the contract was to expire in july we entered into the contract with texas eastern transmission corporation during a time when natural gas supplies were scarce 
over time as natural gas supplies became more abundant  we continued to receive the contract price for our gas production from this block  although such price was by then substantially higher than the market price 
in  texas eastern transmission corporation sued us alleging termination of the contract 
in we settled this litigation and received million as part of the settlement 
the contract continued to be in effect  although the settlement reduced the new contract price to approximately one half of the original contract price 
these prices  however  escalated each year 
for the first six months of  under the contract  we received per mcf for gas produced from the southern portion of the block and per mcf for gas produced from the northern portion of the block 
on july   we executed an agreement with texas eastern transmission corporation to terminate this gas sales contract 
the termination was effective june   and as of july   we began selling all gas produced from this block at spot market prices 
we received million in cash and agreed to release texas eastern from the contract  including the gas substitution and indemnification rights  as well as related indemnification and other obligations that had been in effect under the settlement agreement between texas eastern and us 
during the first six months of  we received approximately million more for the gas sold at the long term contract price compared to the same gas if sold at spot market prices 
during the last six months of  we calculate that gas revenues were approximately million lower than if we had continued to receive the contract price 
phillips petroleum company owns a net profits interest created in by a farm out agreement covering south pass block since  phillips has brought numerous pieces of litigation against us over the net profits interest 
since the inception of the farm out  we have paid phillips petroleum company million related to the net profits interest and overriding royalty 
we have tried numerous times to settle the latest litigation equitably  but so far  have been unsuccessful in our settlement attempts 
our goal is to settle or dispose of this litigation in a manner that would discourage any future litigation 
however  we will vigorously defend ourselves against all litigation that phillips petroleum company brings against us 
we believe  and the louisiana court has ruled  that under the farm out agreement phillips can look only to actual production for determination of its net profits interest 
in this latest litigation  phillips contends that pursuant to its net profits interest in south pass block  it was entitled to receive an overriding royalty for months in which net profits were not achieved  that an excessive oil transportation fee was being charged to the net profits account  and that the entire million cash payment that had been received by okc limited partnership our predecessor from the settlement of previous litigation between texas eastern and us  should have been credited to the net profits account instead of the million that was credited 
on the latter claim  phillips seeks to receive in excess of million  while on the first two claims phillips alleges aggregate damages of several million dollars 
in addition  phillips  under the louisiana mineral code  is seeking double damages and cancellation of the farm out agreement that created the net profits interest 
we denied phillips claims and defended ourselves during a non jury trial in april at trial we asserted a counterclaim that phillips had breached a settlement agreement regarding previous litigation  and we sought to recover damages in excess of million 
in august  the trial court ruled in the litigation 
in its ruling  the court awarded phillips million plus interest for its overriding royalty claim and million plus interest for its claim on the settlement 
the trial court dismissed phillips claim of excessive transportation charges and its claims for double damages and lease cancellation 
the trial court also dismissed our counterclaim 
in october  the trial court finalized its judgment 
the judgment  including interest  was million 
we have filed notice of our intent to appeal certain adverse portions of the judgment 
the trial court has required that we post a bond in order to prevent phillips from executing on the judgment pending appeal 
the amount of the bond is million  million of which is collateralized by cash and a letter of credit 
during the pendency of the appeal  simple interest will continue to accrue on the million judgment 
phillips has also filed notice to appeal 
in connection with the judgment  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
entitled accounting for contingencies  we recorded million as an expense in the third quarter of in connection with the proceeds from the termination of the texas eastern gas sales contract  we filed a declaratory judgment action against phillips in federal district court in dallas  texas 
in the action we asked the court to declare that none of the million we received from the contract termination is owed to phillips under the farm out agreement 
in existing litigation in collin county  texas  addressing the same issues that have been adjudicated by the louisiana court  phillips has filed a counterclaim asserting that the proceeds of the termination agreement should be credited to the net profits account 
in response to phillips counterclaim  we have filed an amended petition seeking a declaratory judgment that the termination proceeds need not be credited to the net profits account 
we agreed to dismiss our federal action  and the collin county action is stayed pending resolution of the louisiana appeal 
certain possible outcomes of our current litigation with phillips petroleum company could have a material adverse effect on remington 
in june  we entered into a merger agreement with s sixteen holding company  which was approved by the stockholders on december  one of the subsidiaries we acquired in the merger  ckb petroleum  inc  owns an undivided interest in the pipeline that transports our oil production from four of our offshore properties to venice  louisiana 
we anticipate that the acquisition of ckb petroleum  inc will have a positive effect on our future net income and cash flow from operations 
in addition  we issued a new single class of voting common stock in exchange for the surrender of all of the previously outstanding voting and non voting common stock 
holders of the class a voting common stock received shares of the new common stock for each share of class a common stock owned 
holders of class b non voting common stock received share of the new common stock for each share of class b common stock owned 
new accounting standards new accounting standards include statements of financial accounting standards no 
entitled accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the provisions of statement no 
 which require companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at their fair value  will not have a material effect on our financial statements or related disclosures 
liquidity and capital resources our balance sheet liquidity increased significantly during the third quarter of after we received million from the termination of our gas contract with texas eastern 
during the fourth quarter of we reinvested million in an acquisition of offshore gulf of mexico blocks and paid down our bank line of credit by million 
in addition  because of the merger agreement and the exchange of our common stock  we were required to offer to purchase any tendered convertible subordinated notes 
of the million outstanding at december   we were required to purchase million on february  we refinanced million of the purchase with a long term bank line of credit and used cash to purchase the remaining million of the tendered notes 
at december   we reclassified the portion of the convertible notes that we purchased with cash as a current liability 
primarily because of the acquisition  payment on the bank line of credit  and the reclassification of the convertible subordinated notes  our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by million and the current ratio was 
to at december   current assets exceeded current liabilities by million and the current ratio was approximately to cash flow from operations for increased million  or  compared to the increase relates to the cash received from the termination of the gas contract 
without the proceeds from the termination of the gas contract  cash flow from operations would have decreased by million  or 
this decrease resulted from lower total oil prices and lower gas revenue from south pass block and the increase in restricted cash used as collateral for the appeal bond in the phillips litigation 
the average oil prices for were per barrel compared to per barrel during the lower oil prices caused oil revenues to be million lower in this reduction was somewhat offset by an increase of  barrels sold 
in addition  gas sales revenue from south pass block decreased million during the decrease in gas revenue from south pass block resulted primarily from lower gas production for the first six months of and both lower production and lower gas prices during the last six months of if the gas production during the third and fourth quarters of from south pass block had been sold at the former contract price  gas revenues would have been approximately million higher than was actually received 
the decline in oil prices has a negative impact on total revenues  net income  and cash flow from operations 
in addition  the termination of the long term gas contract also has a negative impact on our gas sales  net income  and cash flow from operations 
however  because of recent acquisitions and completed and planned development drilling in and  we project a increase in total production for as compared to based on this increase  our current projections indicate that we can finance the majority of our planned capital expenditures through our cash flow from operations 
our projections consider the current depressed oil and gas prices 
we also have million available on our bank line of credit 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
the primary source of funding the capital expenditures will be net cash flow from operations and additional bank debt 
we have budgeted million for capital expenditures in while we have projected this amount for capital expenditures  we can delay or cancel the drilling of wells included in the current capital expenditure budget 
our capital expenditure budget for  includes drilling exploratory wells and development wells 
in the gulf of mexico  we are currently drilling a development well in south pass block  an exploratory well in eugene island block  and connecting the high island block well to a production platform 
we also have plans for additional drilling on high island block and galveston block during the first quarter of  we completed a sidetrack of well a on main pass block this well did not encounter commercial oil or gas reserves 
we completed the berryman unit well in nueces  county  texas during the first quarter of  which tested at  mcf per day and barrels of oil per day 
this well is now waiting for a pipeline connection 
we are currently participating in an additional exploratory well located miles south of this discovery well 
in addition we have planned additional exploratory wells from d defined prospects in south texas 
at december   we had a revolving line of credit established with a bank 
the line of credit had a borrowing base of million and an expiration date of march  our oil and gas properties were the collateral for this line of credit 
at december   we had an outstanding balance of million and had issued letters of credit totaling  against this line of credit 
in february  we replaced the existing line of credit with a new line of credit from a different bank 
the new line of credit with a borrowing base of million expires in we pledged our oil and gas properties as collateral for the new line of credit 
on february   we borrowed million on this line of credit and used the majority of the proceeds to buy a portion of the convertible notes 
the bank will review the borrowing base semi annually and may increase or decrease the borrowing base relative to the redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
year issue the year issue relates to computer programs written with two digits defining a year rather than four 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year instead of or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause a breakdown of both information technology and non information technology systems and cause these systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
we have assessed and continue to assess the year issue and its impact on us  our partners  suppliers  vendors and customers 
the year issue has a potential impact on us in several areas including  among others  the ability to be paid for our oil and gas production  the operations of the producing properties in which we hold an interest  the ability to pay our vendors and suppliers  and the management of our financial assets including cash and securities held with financial institutions 
we currently receive payment for the majority of our oil and gas production from two sources 
while these two sources are currently studying the year issue in order to develop systems to prevent problems in payment processing  they have informed us that manual backup systems exist so that even in the event that the computer software fails  such failure would not result in a material delay in our receiving payment for oil and gas production 
during the first quarter of  we operated one of our oil and gas properties 
the property was not commercial therefore we have not developed contingency plans relating to the year issue concerning the operation of this property 
we do not believe that any problem relating to the year issue on this property will have a material impact on our operations 
the operators of our other properties are  however  studying the year issue in connection with both the information technology and non information technology aspects of operating the oil and gas properties 
these operators have informed us that they will develop systems sufficient to address any problems that may arise 
in addition the operators have informed us that manual back up systems exist in the event the computer software fails to adequately address any problems 
if  in the future  we act as operator on any other oil or gas property  we anticipate that we will provide for adequate systems to address any year issue 
we continue to assess our current oil and gas accounting system and network operating software to determine if they are year compliant 
the company that provides our oil and gas accounting software has informed us that that the system is year compliant 
in june  we will assess our network system and individual computers and make any repairs or upgrades as required at that time 
in the event that the network operating system fails due to a year problem  we believe that our accounting system can operate on a stand alone basis 
we do not believe that the year issue will materially affect our ability to pay our vendors and suppliers or track our assets in the custody of financial institutions 
we do not believe that the cost of our preparations or upgrades for any year issues or problems will be material 
results of operations net income for was million or per share diluted income per share compared to a net loss for of million or per share 
the increase in net income resulted primarily from the termination of the gas contract with texas eastern in july lower oil and gas prices  reductions of gas production at south pass block  and the phillips petroleum judgment partially offset the income from the termination of the gas contract 
the following table discloses the net oil and gas sales volumes  average sales prices and average lifting costs for each of the three years ended december    and the table is an integral part of the following discussion of results of operations for the periods compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease net sales volumes oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf    average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf average lifting costs per boe compared to oil revenue for  decreased million because of a  or  decrease in prices  partially offset by a  barrel  or  increase in oil production 
the lower prices alone caused oil revenue to be million lower 
oil production increased primarily because of additional oil production from the parker creek property in mississippi and the west buna property in south texas 
gas revenue for was million  or  lower than  primarily due to the lower production from south pass block in compared to the prior year 
in  production from this block was bcf lower than in causing a decrease in gas revenue of approximately million 
the average gas price decrease  from to resulted primarily from the termination of the gas sales contract on south pass block we sold gas from south pass block at an average price of per mcf in compared to in gas production from properties other than south pass block increased  mcf  or  primarily from eugene island block in the gulf of mexico 
other income increased primarily because of the million received from the termination of the gas sales contract 
operating costs increased during compared to because the number of our producing properties has increased significantly 
net profits expense decreased in because of the decreased revenues credited to the net profits account on south pass block exploration expense increased  or  primarily due to increased expenditures for d seismic data 
dry hole expense  which is included in exploration expense  included million for costs accumulated on the main pass block well a at december  this well was determined to be non commercial during the first quarter of depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased by million  or  because of an increase in proved oil and gas reserves on producing properties 
the impairment expense recorded in includes million for impairment on south pass block platform b that was recorded in the third quarter of due to the termination of the gas sales contract 
in connection with the august judgment issued in our litigation with phillips petroleum company  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
entitled accounting for contingencies  we recorded an million expense in august this amount includes the damage award by the trial court and the estimated interest on the award 
we reduced general and administrative expense by in compared to the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily from reduced salaries and payroll expense  rent expense  and professional services fees 
legal expenses decreased because of the reduction in expense associated with defending the phillips petroleum company litigation and the settlement of other litigation 
reorganization expense for includes payments to employees under employee severance agreements and legal fees or other charges that relate to or were paid because of the purchase of s sixteen holding company formerly box brothers holding company by mr 
j 
r 
simplot in august we recorded the following as reorganization costs employee severance payments million  thomas d 
box severance and legal claims and fees million  mr 
simplot and mr 
james arthur lyle million for legal claims and fees  and other associated expenses  interest expense is lower for because of our purchase of million of the outstanding convertible subordinated notes in october in  we recorded a valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax benefit  and reflected the amount in the income statement as deferred income tax expense 
in  we were able to use those tax benefits to the extent that our effective federal income tax rate for is only about 
the income tax expense for includes alternative minimum tax expense of  as a current income tax expense 
compared to we incurred a net loss for of million or per share compared to the prior year loss of million or per share 
the net loss for included non cash charges totaling million or per share 
the charges included deferred income tax expense of million or per share  impairment charges from marginal oil and gas properties of million or per share  and accelerated amortization of debt issue costs of  or per share  caused by the early retirement of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes in october in addition  during  we incurred reorganization costs totaling million  or per share  and legal costs and expenses totaling million  or per share 
total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  gas sales revenue decreased million  or  for compared to lower gas production caused the decrease but was partially offset by higher average prices of for spot gas sales and for gas sales under the south pass gas sales contract 
the increase in average prices added million to gas sales revenue 
gas production from south pass block platform b decreased bcf during as production from well b experienced anticipated declines 
the decrease in gas production from platform b caused gas revenues to decrease by million 
natural gas production from our south texas properties increased  mcf during but was more than offset by lower net natural gas production from other offshore properties 
an increase in oil production partially offset by lower oil prices resulted in a net increase in oil sales revenue of million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
oil production increased by  barrels which increased oil sales revenue by million 
however  a decrease of in average oil prices caused oil sales revenue to be million lower 
a net increase in oil production came from all areas of operation but the most significant increases came from the parker creek field in mississippi and south pass blocks and in the gulf of mexico 
our interest income decreased because we sold our marketable securities in october and used most of the proceeds to purchase million of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
other income was lower because of lower oil trading income and losses on the sale of assets  primarily artwork 
operating and transportation expenses increased as a result of new operating properties and an increase in oil production from the south pass area 
net profits expense decreased as a result of the lower natural gas sales revenues from south pass block in addition  exploration expenses decreased significantly because of lower dry hole costs 
in  we drilled three high cost dry exploration wells totaling million in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased because of new properties becoming productive 
marginal production as well as lower oil prices caused us to record impairment charges against some of the oil and natural gas properties 
a large decrease in production during the last quarter of from main pass block  located in the gulf of mexico  caused us to record a million impairment charge to write down of the remaining well costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased by during when compared to salaries and other employment related expenses during decreased  as the number of employees decreased from at december  to at december  other areas of significant savings were professional fees and investor relations expenses 
legal fees decreased by million as we settled outstanding litigation and concluded the trial proceedings in the phillips litigation 
reorganization expense for the year includes payments to employees under the employee severance agreements and legal fees or other charges 
reorganization costs accrued or paid are as follows employee severance payments million  thomas d 
box severance  legal claims and fees million  mr 
simplot and mr 
lyle million  and other associated expenses interest and financing expenses increased during when compared to the increase results from an increase on our line of credit and a non cash charge for deferred offering costs on the convertible subordinated notes in october we used the line of credit to provide a portion of the funds to purchase some onshore gulf coast properties 
in we increased the valuation allowance against the entire deferred tax asset and recorded a deferred income tax expense 
our actual results and future projections were significantly different than anticipated in our and prior projections 
the difference resulted from a significant drop in commodity prices  the unusual and unforeseen reorganization expenses incurred in the last half of  and a downward revision in our proved gas reserves as of january   on south pass block we believe that future drilling results  planned capital expenditures and other future transactions could allow us to realize substantial benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards and the other book tax attributes underlying the deferred income tax asset 
however  the requirement of a greater than probability more likely than not of occurrence does not allow us to use much of this information in projecting future taxable income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk sensitive instrument at december   is a revolving line of credit from a bank 
at december   the unpaid principal balance under the line was million 
the interest rate on this debt is sensitive to market fluctuations  however we do not believe that significant fluctuations in the market interest have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flow from operations
