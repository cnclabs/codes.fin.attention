item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation for the three years ended december  and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
differences from united states gaap are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  and  the corporation s primary mining operation was the hycroft formerly crofoot lewis mine in nevada  which began gold production in in january  the corporation took steps to improve its cash flow and liquidated its forward position in the gold futures market and reduced mining activities at the hycroft mine 
in december  mining activities were suspended at the hycroft mine 
gold processing and recovery will continue from inventoried ore in and  with gold production for estimated at approximately  ounces 
in october  the corporation acquired the mineral ridge mine  a gold property located in nevada 
as of december   proven and probable reserves at the mineral ridge mine were million tons at a grade of ounces per ton containing  ounces of gold 
prior to the acquisition of the mineral ridge mine by the corporation  the mine had been shut down since december gold production for is estimated at between  and  ounces 
results of operations compared with the net loss for was million compared to a net loss of million in the net loss included gains of million from the disposal of assets  while the net loss included gains of million from the disposal of assets 
the net loss also included a one time gain on the liquidation of gold futures of million  while there was no similar gain in the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties and investments 
there were no similar write downs in excluding gains from the liquidations of gold futures and the disposal of assets  and write downs of mineral properties and investments  the net loss of was slightly less than the loss of million 
average gross realized prices declined in as the gold spot price continued to drop 
gold revenues of million in decreased million  or from  primarily because of the lower average gross realized price combined with a decrease in gold production 
gold ounces   average gross realized price gold production decreased  ounces from  in to  ounces in the decrease in gold production was attributable to the reduction in mining activities at the hycroft mine 
in  million ore tons were mined as compared to million ore tons in while ore tons mined decreased in  gold production only decreased 
the positive variance was largely due to measures taken in to improve solution flow rates and gold production  combined with higher than expected ore grades in lower average cash balances led to lower interest income for the year 
interest income in was million as compared to million in total revenues decreased million to million in operating costs from mining operations decreased million from to million in the decrease was due to the reduction in mining activities at the hycroft mine 
total tons mined  including waste tons  decreased to million tons in from million tons in the average cost per ton mined increased to in  as compared to in  as a result of inefficiencies associated with the reduction in mining activities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization in of million was relatively unchanged from however  the provision for reclamation and closure costs of million in increased dramatically from million in the increase compensated for the new hycroft mine plan which called for the reduction and subsequent suspension of mining activities in the new mine plan optimized the mine s ore reserve in light of reduced gold prices and concentrated on lower production cost ounces 
amortization and accrual rates increased because of the reduction in total tons and ounces called for in the new mine plan 
operating lease costs in decreased to million as compared to million in during  the leases on several large pieces of mobile mining equipment terminated and the equipment was purchased at the end of the leases 
the corporation does not have any other outstanding major equipment leases 
mineral exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were million in holding costs for the corporation s bolivian properties were million in the corporation incurred these holding costs while maintaining and protecting its property interests in bolivia  operating its administrative office in la paz  and sustaining its development and social operations at the amayapampa and capa circa properties 
there were no similar costs in excluding the bolivian holding costs  mineral exploration and property evaluation expenses were million as compared to million in the million decrease reflects the corporation s efforts to control costs and conserve cash in during  the corporation s exploration efforts were focused on latin america and the mineral ridge mine in nevada 
corporate administration and investor relations decreased million in to million as the corporation continued to reduce its overhead and administrative costs 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  reflecting the corporation s lower average debt balance during the year 
in  the gain on the disposal of assets was million and primarily consisted of the sales of surplus mining equipment from the hycroft mine and the sale of the corporation s non producing tartan mine in canada 
as discussed above  the corporation liquidated its forward position in the gold futures market in january as a result  net hedging gains of million were realized  of which million was recognized immediately as other revenue with the balance deferred to subsequent periods 
no such gain was recorded in income tax expense increased million in to million  primarily as a result of us alternative minimum taxes which limit the corporation s ability to utilize existing loss carry forwards 
management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and investments 
in  the carrying values of certain properties and investments were written down by million 
no similar write down was required in compared with the net loss for was million compared to a net loss of million in the net loss included a million write down of mineral properties and investments  while there was no similar write down in the net loss also included gains of million from the disposal of assets  while the net loss included gains of million from the disposal of assets 
excluding these write downs and gains  losses decreased million from million in to million in the decrease in losses was largely attributable to improved gold revenues 
despite lower average gross realized prices  gold revenues of million in increased million  or from because of increased gold production as follows gold ounces   average gross realized price gold production in increased  or  ounces  from the increase in gold production was attributable to increased ore production combined with increased solution pumping capacity at the mine 
ounces placed on the heap leach pads increased to  ounces in in  the corporation obtained the requisite environmental permits and increased the solution pumping capacity at the mine to improve flow rates and thereby improve production 
at december   gold inventory at the hycroft mine was  ounces as compared to  ounces in lower average cash balances led to lower interest income for the year 
interest income in was million as compared to million in combined revenues from gold sales and interest income increased million to million in operating costs from mining operations decreased million from to million in the decrease from was due to general efficiency increases in light of lower gold prices 
total tons mined  including waste tons  increased to million tons from million tons in mining costs decreased to million in from million in the combined mining cost per ton decreased to in as compared to in depreciation  depletion  amortization  and the provision for reclamation and closure costs in was higher than  due to the addition of new mining and processing equipment in combined with a mine plan change in the new mine plan optimized the mine s ore reserve in light of reduced gold prices and concentrated on lower production cost ounces 
amortization and accrual rates increased because of the reduction in total tons and ounces called for in the new mine plan 
operating lease costs in were approximately the same as mineral exploration and property evaluation expenses decreased from to million reflecting the corporation s efforts to control costs in during  the corporation ceased exploration in the united states and in december  sold its remaining united states exploration interests 
the corporation s exploration program concentrated on latin america 
corporate administration  investor relations and other income and expenses decreased million in to million as the corporation continued to reduce its overhead costs 
interest expense in was million as a result of the new debt agreement entered into during the year 
in  no similar debt existed 
in  the gain on the disposal of assets and mineral properties was million and was primarily comprised of the divestiture of the corporation s united states exploration properties combined with the sales of surplus mining equipment from the hycroft mine 
management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets and investments 
these evaluations indicated that the carrying values of certain properties and investments were overstated and  accordingly  were written down 
based upon management s evaluations  million was written down  including bolivian mineral properties million  hycroft mine million  investment in zamora million  venezuelan mineral properties million  and tartan lake mine million 
year as the year approaches  there are uncertainties concerning whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or fail 
a significant portion of the corporation s computer systems and software are already configured to accommodate dates beyond the year the corporation believes that the year will not pose significant operational problems for the corporation s computer systems 
at present  the corporation has established a plan to identify and resolve potential year issues 
the plan includes the following five key elements to test and evaluate the hardware components of the corporation s computer systems  to test and evaluate the software components of the corporation s computer systems  to test and evaluate any date time sensitive components of the corporation s operating assets and control systems  to evaluate and prioritize the potential impact of any third party computer systems  and to take corrective actions where necessary 
the corporation intends to complete the identification of potential year issues in june the resolution of any year issues will be dependent on the nature of the issue 
however  where any internal equipment or software is concerned  the corporation will respond by modifying  upgrading  or replacing any features that are not year compliant 
where possible  the corporation will also attempt to incorporate redundancy to reduce the likelihood of year failures and contingency plans to minimize the effect of year failures 
additionally  printed and electronic back ups are kept of all material transactions  reports  systems and software where the effects of year failures could adversely impact the corporation 
the corporation does not expect that the cost of the remedial efforts to address year issues will be significant 
the corporation has not yet completed its assessment of all of its systems  or the computer systems of third parties with which it deals and  while it is not possible at this time to assess the effect of a third party s inability to adequately address year issues  the corporation does not believe the potential problems associated with year will have a material effect on its financial results 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation s consolidated cash balance at december  was million  an increase of million from the end of the previous year 
during  operating and hedging activities generated million before changes in operating assets and liabilities  which generated an additional million 
excluding the non cash purchase of mineral ridge inc  investing activities generated million and financing activities consumed million for a net increase to cash of million 
during  the corporation reduced its gold inventory by million and converted million to cash by selling gold 
the remaining million of unsold gold bullion was available for sale and included in accounts receivable at december  the reduction of accounts payable and accrued liabilities during consumed million in cash and the resulting net change in operating assets and liabilities was a million increase in cash 
proceeds from the disposal of assets  primarily resulting from the sale of surplus mining equipment from the hycroft mine and the sale of the non producing tartan mine  were million in capital expenditures in included million at the hycroft mine  primarily for the buy out of major equipment leases  million at the mineral ridge mine for acquisition and development costs  and million in latin america  primarily for the continued study and evaluation of the amayapampa and capa circa properties 
in total  investing activities generated million in cash 
during  the corporation completely retired the million of outstanding debt collateralized by the assets of the hycroft mine 
this was the only cash financing transaction in reclamation and environmental costs management estimates the reclamation and closure costs for the corporation s mines as follows hycroft mine million mineral ridge mine million total estimated costs million these costs are charged to earnings over the lives of the mines and the provision to date is million 
in april  the nevada bureau of land management blm approved an amended hycroft mine reclamation plan that included the brimstone deposit  and an uncollateralized surety bond in the amount of million was posted to secure reclamation obligations under the plan 
in september  the blm approved the mineral ridge mine plan of operations and a surety bond in the amount of million was posted 
cash collateral in the amount of million has been posted as security for the surety bond 
regulatory compliance and other matters during  there were no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations 
outlook gold prices continued to decline in and while there has been some recent price improvement  the corporation is making its plans on the assumption that low gold prices will persist in and into at the hycroft mine  the corporation took steps to improve its cash flow in january and liquidated its forward position in the gold futures market 
the liquidation of the corporation s gold forward position generated million in cash 
waste rock mining at the hycroft mine was then halted and the corporation planned to suspend ore mining in may better ore grades than expected allowed ore mining to continue until december gold processing and recovery will continue from inventoried ore in and and gold production in is anticipated to be  ounces 
a reconciliation of brimstone ore reserves mined showed that approximately more gold was mined than projected from the estimated reserves from exploration results prior to mining 
in  the corporation plans to conduct a program  including redrilling  to determine if this upgrading applies to the remaining brimstone gold resources 
a positive result from this study or higher gold prices could permit resumption of production at the hycroft mine 
currently  the corporation plans to maintain the plant and facilities on a standby basis until production can be restarted 
in the short term  the corporation will commence reclamation in areas that would not be affected by future operations 
at the mineral ridge mine  the mining operation has been restarted and the processing plant is undergoing start up and commissioning 
a number of significant modifications  which were identified prior to acquisition  have been made to the plant 
in addition  an inadequate ore feeding arrangement identified during start up was replaced in february as a result of the feeder replacement  the start up schedule has been extended by approximately one month 
this is not expected to have a significant effect on the estimated gold production of between  to  ounces in in december  the corporation started a drilling program designed to add gold reserves to the mineral ridge mine 
the initial program is designed to extend or confirm mineralization in areas where no information exists 
following the evaluation of these results  additional drilling will continue 
in bolivia  the corporation recently completed an optimized internal feasibility study on the project 
based on a gold price of per ounce  the proven and probable reserves at amayapampa are calculated to be million tons grading ounces per ton including dilution  containing  ounces of gold 
indicated resources at capa circa  located ten kilometres from amayapampa  are  tons grading ounces per ton including dilution  containing  ounces of gold 
the initial capital costs are estimated to be million  including working capital and a contingency 
the corporation has been in discussions with various lenders and has recently received an indicative term sheet from a major international bank for the debt financing component for the project and is exploring alternatives to complete the total financing package 
during  the corporation s activities will focus on arranging financing for the construction and development of the amayapampa capa circa project 
the corporation has sufficient cash on hand to continue producing gold at the hycroft mine and to complete the start up and commissioning activities at the mineral ridge mine 
the ability of the corporation to re start mining activities at hycroft is dependent on gold prices and the potential for higher grade oxide ore 
the anticipated cash flows from operations are expected to adequately provide the working capital the corporation requires and allow the corporation to maintain the bolivian properties while it seeks project financing 
however  the corporation will have to raise additional funds from external sources in order to undertake construction and development of the bolivian properties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the corporation is engaged in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing  refining and reclamation 
gold bullion is the corporation s principal product 
changes in the price of gold could significantly affect the corporation s profitability and cash flows 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time 
for a description of factors that affect gold prices  see note a to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  under item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements 
using current estimates of production at an estimated average gold price of per ounce  including the effects of the corporation s hedging position and management s estimate of expected operating expenses  a change in the gold price would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in net income and cash flows 
the corporation occasionally utilizes derivative commodity instruments for purposes other than trading purposes to manage the corporation s exposure to the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of gold by protecting the selling price of a portion of its production 
the market risk of these commodity instruments to the corporation s cash flow is related to the possible failure of all counterparties to honour their contractual obligations 
also  precious metals contracts between the corporation and various counterparties involve the requirement that the corporation deliver gold to the counterparty at agreed upon prices 
if the counterparty is unable to fulfill its purchase obligations  there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to receive the agreed upon sales price in the open market 
if the corporation is unable to produce sufficient gold to meet its hedging contract obligations  it may be obligated to purchase such gold at the then market price 
for further information regarding the corporation s hedging program  see note a to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  under item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the corporation s outstanding forward sales contracts were for  ounces at a projected average price of per ounce to be delivered in the corporation has the ability to defer the date that the related gold is ultimately delivered 
in january  the corporation closed out forward sales contracts covering  ounces for cash consideration of approximately million 
the proceeds were recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized in gold sales when the original hedged transaction would have matured 
interest rate risk at december   the interest rate on the corporation s long term debt was libor plus 
the interest rate on this debt is variable and is reset periodically at the option the corporation 
as a result  management does not believe that the corporation is exposed to significant interest rate risk and the corporation does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the price of gold is denominated in us dollars  and all of the corporation s revenues and a significant majority of its expenses are incurred in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the corporation is exposed to any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk and the corporation does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
