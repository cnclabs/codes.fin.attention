net revenues increased million  or  during fiscal the increase in net sales is due to higher sales of generic products and specialty materials  and brand product sales resulting from the acquisition of the micro k r product line during the fourth quarter see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which were partially offset by lower contract services sales and licensing revenues  as shown in the following table in s increase decrease vs prior year amount percent generic products  brand products  nm specialty materials  contract services licensing revenues total increase  generic product sales increased million  or  during fiscal due to the introduction of new products and higher sales volume across the majority of the existing products 
new products contributed million and existing products contributed million of the increase  however  such increases were partially offset by price declines of million against total sales for the prior year 
the increase in sales on existing products reflected increased market share on an expanded customer base  increased generic substitution rates and a full year s sales impact of products introduced in the prior year across several product categories 
the price decline was confined largely to a single product category where increased competition on revenue sharing products based on sales and gross margin adversely affected prices 
brand name product sales represented a partial month s sales of the micro k r product lines which was acquired from american home products in march the product line had annual sales of approximately million at the time of the acquisition and will be marketed by the company s ther rx subsidiary 
the company is in the process of completing the building of the sales  marketing and administrative infrastructure to support its direct marketing of brand name products 
this effort supports the company s plan to directly market and distribute technology enhanced  brand name pharmaceuticals in specific niche therapeutic areas 
micro k r is the first product to be marketed in support of this strategy 
sales of specialty materials increased million  or  during fiscal due primarily to a full year s sales impact of two products introduced in the prior year by the company s particle dynamics subsidiary  which contributed million  or  of the increase 
particle dynamics also increased its customer base during fiscal  primarily for its line of calcium carbonate products  which accounted for approximately of total sales for the fiscal year 
calcium carbonate sales were up for the fiscal year 
contract services and licensing revenues decreased 
million  or  due to lower volume  reflecting a smaller customer base as the company de emphasized lower margin contract manufacturing in its business strategy 
while the company anticipates continued overall growth in sales of the products the company markets  there are no assurances that the annual percentage rate of sales growth will continue at past levels 
costs and expenses 
manufacturing costs increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased volume 
manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenues declined to from  due primarily to a favorable shift in the mix of products sold toward higher margin products  which was partially offset by lower average pricing  as shown in the following table revenues fy manufacturing costs change due to price decline product mix fy manufacturing costs the price decline and improvement in product mix was due primarily to changes in the generic business 
lower pricing due to increased competition eroded margins on certain products 
the improvement in product mix reflected a decrease in volume on the lower margin business and increases in sales of higher margin new products introduced in fiscal and research and development costs increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due to higher personnel costs 
million  or  increased usage of r d materials and laboratory supplies 
million  or and higher levels of clinical testing 
million  or 
the company increased its r d activity in fiscal and is currently developing more than drug compounds in its development pipeline 
the company expects to continue a relatively high level of expenditures and investment for research  clinical and regulatory efforts relating to the development of proprietary new products and advanced technology products and their approval for marketing 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat with the prior year  decreasing nominally to from 
the increase in expenses was related primarily to higher costs associated with additional personnel to support the company s continued growth million  or  the branded sales initiative 
million  or and increased marketing activities associated with sales of generic products million  or 
amortization expense decreased nominally in fiscal due primarily to lower expense associated with amortization of financing fees 
million  partially offset by one half month s amortization of the micro k r product rights acquired near the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the product rights are being amortized over twenty years at an annual rate of million 
other income  net  increased million to million during fiscal due to a non recurring gain related to an arbitration award of million in connection with a supplier who was unable to supply product 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes were provided at an effective rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the lower effective rate in fiscal reflected the utilization of the deferred tax asset valuation reserve 
net income 
as a result of the factors described above  net income improved million  or to million for fiscal from net income of million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal this sales growth was primarily due to an increase in the volume of new and existing generic products sold by ethex and pharmaceutical compounds sold by particle dynamics  partially offset by lower contract services sales 
net revenues from ethex increased million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the launch of twelve new generic products during fiscal which contributed million of the sales increase 
the remainder of the sales increase million was due to higher volume across the existing ethex product line 
net revenues derived from the sale of specialty pharmaceutical compounds increased million  or  to million during fiscal this increase was attributable entirely to the increased sales volumes related to the introduction of new products for the descote r and destab tm product lines 
contract services revenues decreased 
million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to reduced sales volume

million  or  higher outside professional services million  or and additional personnel to support its continued growth million  or 
the income tax provision was million for fiscal  compared to 
million in fiscal the increase is attributable to the utilization of loss carry forwards generated in prior years during fiscal no loss carryforwards were available in fiscal b regarding commodity prices the company utilizes various raw materials in its manufacturing processes 
although the company historically has not encountered material fluctuations in pricing of such commodities  there is no assurance that pricing of such commodities will remain relatively constant  and the company s manufacturing costs could increase significantly if raw material commodity prices increase by amounts substantially above current prices 
c variable rate risks advances to the company under the company s credit facility bear interest at a rate which varies consistent with increases or decreases in the publicly announced prime rate 
and or the libor rate with respect to libor related loans  if any 
these rates have remained relatively constant for a substantial period of time 
a material increase in such rates  however  could significantly increase borrowing expenses 
for example  an increase of in the prime rate would increase the borrowing expense to the company by approximately  annually on the principal balance of the company s credit facility at march  d year project the company utilizes computer technologies throughout its business to effectively carry out its day to day operations 
computer technologies include both information technology in the form of hardware and software  as well as embedded technology in the company s facilities and equipment 
similar to most companies  the company must determine whether its systems are capable of recognizing and processing date sensitive information properly as the year yk approaches 
the company is utilizing a multi phased concurrent approach to address this issue 
the phases included in its approach are the awareness  assessment  remediation  validation and implementation phases 
the company has completed the awareness and assessment phases and are very active in the remediation phase 
the company has initiated formal communications and has developed a monitoring program with all of its significant suppliers and critical business partners to determine yk compliance and is implementing contingency plans to minimize interruptions in business in the event a third party is unable to perform 
an interruption of the company s ability to conduct business due to a yk readiness problem could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is continuing to assess such third party risks 
the company is not presently aware of any such significant exposure  but  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner or that a failure to properly convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company currently intends to substantially complete the remaining phases of the yk project  including the finalization of contingency plans in the event of disruptions in obtaining needed supplies and services  prior to june  the costs associated with the project are not expected to exceed  of which approximately  had been incurred as of march   and are not deemed to materially impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
the company is actively correcting and replacing the identified systems which are not yk ready in order to ensure its ability to continue to meet its internal needs and those of its customers and suppliers 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios that it might confront with respect to yk issues have to do with third parties not being yk compliant 
the company has evaluated vendor and customer compliance and will implement contingency plans  such as alternate vendor opportunities  after examining compliance evaluations 
based upon the planning and implementation completed to date  the company believes that  with modifications to existing software  conversions to new software  and appropriate remediation of embedded chip equipment  the yk issue is not reasonably likely to pose significant operational problems for the company s information technology systems and embedded chip equipment 
e liquidity and capital resources the following table lists selected cashflow and balance sheet data for fiscal years  and in s cashflow from operations    quick assets    working capital    long term liabilities    shareholders equity    cashflow from operations of million for fiscal was primarily from net income enhanced by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increases in accounts payable and inventories are due to higher levels of raw material and packaging inventories acquired to support increased sales of generic products and higher finished goods inventories associated with the acquisition of micro k r 
receivables also increased due to the higher sales and the million arbitration award see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accrued liabilities increased due to an increase in salaries  wages  benefits and income taxes 
these changes in the components of current assets and liabilities  partially offset by a decline in cash and marketable securities  resulted in a million increase in working capital in fiscal long term liabilities increased to million in fiscal from million as a result of million in borrowings incurred to finance the acquisition of the micro k r product line and the partial financing of the purchase of a new facility of million 
the new facility was acquired to provide additional distribution and office space for the company s branded and generic pharmaceutical businesses 
investing activities for fiscal included capital expenditures of million  the investment of million of cash in marketable securities and a cash payment of million in connection with the acquisition of the micro k r product line 
capital expenditures relate primarily to the acquisition of the new facility and equipment to expand production capacity for generic products 
in addition  the company had capital projects in progress at march  that it estimates will require million to complete in the next fiscal year 
the majority of this amount relates to the cost to complete the upgrade of the company s business software and network systems which is estimated at million 
the company believes that existing cash and securities balances  cash generated from operating activities and funds available under its credit facility will be adequate to fund operating activities in the short and long term  including near and long term debt obligations  capital improvements  product development activities and expansion of marketing capabilities for the branded pharmaceutical business for the presently foreseeable future 
as of march  the company has a loan agreement expiring june  with lasalle national bank 
the agreement provides for a revolving line of credit for borrowing up to million 
the company had cash borrowing of million and million in open letters of credit issued under this facility

to the company s working capital ratio declined in fiscal as a result of a decrease in the year end cash and marketable securities balance to million from million at the end of fiscal the decrease relates primarily to the million cash payment made in connection with the acquisition of the micro k r product line 
the company s debt to equity and total liabilities to equity ratios increased due to the million increase in long term debt associated with increased borrowings from its credit facility to finance the micro k r acquisition and million in mortgage debt incurred to purchase the new office and distribution facility 
inflation 
although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by the company 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
in addition  changes in the mix of products sold and the effect of competition has made a comparison of changes in selling prices less meaningful relative to changes in the overall rate of inflation over the past three years 
f new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sop reporting on the costs of start up activities  requires that costs be expensed as incurred 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company believes that the adoption of sop will have no material effect on its financial statements
