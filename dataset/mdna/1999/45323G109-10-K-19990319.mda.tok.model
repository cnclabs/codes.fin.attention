the company believes the funding expected to be generated from operations and provided by the credit facilities existing on december  and the credit facilities acquired in the february merger with vanstar  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital investment needs in year inacom began preparing its computer based systems for year yk computer software compliance issues in historically  certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  software may recognize a date using the two digits as rather than the year computer programs that do not recognize the proper date could generate erroneous data or cause systems to fail 
inacom s yk project covers both traditional computer systems and infrastructure it systems and computer based hardware and software  facilities and equipment non it systems 
inacom s yk project has six phases inventory  assessment  renovation  testing  implementation and contingency planning 
inacom completed the remediation of its critical business systems during the fourth quarter of inacom expects to replace any non compliant it systems by the end of the first quarter of  with testing and implementation completed by the end of the second quarter of inacom will replace non compliant systems acquired pursuant to the vanstar merger in the third quarter of inacom has also completed an inventory and assessment of its non it systems  which are primarily located at its distribution centers and office locations 
inacom expects to replace any non compliant systems by the end of the first quarter of  with testing and implementation completed by the end of the second quarter of inacom s yk project also considers the readiness of significant customers and vendors 
such significant vendors have indicated to inacom an expectation to be yk compliant 
however  the non compliance of such vendors could impair the ability of inacom to obtain necessary products or to sell or provide services to its customers 
disruptions of the computer systems of inacom s vendors could have a material adverse effect on inacom s financial conditions and results of operations for the period of such disruption 
inacom believes that the most reasonably likely worst case yk scenario is that a small number of vendors will be unable to supply components for a short time after january   with a resulting disruption of product shipments and services to inacom s customers 
as part of its yk process  inacom plans to develop contingency plans with respect to such scenario and the vendors who are either unable or unwilling to develop remediation plans to become yk compliant 
inacom is currently developing these plans 
inacom s contingency plans will include a combination of actions including stockpiling of products and components and selective resourcing of business to yk compliant vendors 
inacom has incurred approximately million of yk project expenses as of december  future expenses are estimated to include approximately million of additional costs 
such cost estimates are based upon presently available information and may change as inacom continues with its yk project
