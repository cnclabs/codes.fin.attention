these product line reductions lowered sales by million  or compared with net sales of million for were lower than net sales of million in lamson vylon pipe business accounted for million of this decline

year compliance as is the case with most other companies utilizing information technology systems in their businesses  the company is in the process of evaluating and addressing year yk compliance of its information technology systems as set forth below 
these efforts are designed to identify  address and resolve issues that may be created by information technology systems written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this could result in a systems failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  invoices or engage in other normal business activities 
in  the company began a comprehensive review of the operating systems which underlie its ability to conduct daily business activity 
over the next three years  concluding in  the company spent in excess of million to replace its core business operations and communications software systems  virtually all of the computer and telecommunications hardware  and re engineered or adopted best practices throughout its business process activities 
the primary impetus for this investment was to support the attainment of strategic business objectives and to address yk concerns concurrently 
this investment included a significant commitment to electronic commerce activities with our customers and manufacturers sales representative organizations 
in addition  the company has implemented extensive education and skill development programs to provide for continued knowledge transfer  ongoing support and functionality development 
during  the company authorized an independent audit of all software and facilities equipment at each of its business sites to identify potential areas of exposure  representing a continuing proactive investment in addressing yk concerns 
as a follow up to this audit  a yk cross functional team was formed to monitor and assess official compliance statements from our software and equipment vendors and to initiate remediation activities at the non compliant sites where potentially there could be a material impact on our business 
in addition  the company has contacted our significant customers and suppliers to inform them of our compliance status  to determine their state of readiness and to identify any subsequent actions which may be needed by us 
current analysis indicates that our core business information system  to the best of our knowledge  is yk compliant 
as we address potential areas of non compliance  we are evaluating and prioritizing them on the basis of their materiality to our business 
we are utilizing existing staff in the respective functional areas to assist in this evaluation process and take appropriate corrective action  but we do not expect to incur significant additional costs based on what has been identified to date 
we will continue our compliance investigation and develop contingency plans where necessary 
we plan to complete the assessment phase by the end of the second quarter of  and expect to achieve yk readiness on our internal computer systems and facilities equipment by the end of the third quarter of while the information we have received regarding third party systems  on which the company s systems rely  indicates that they are or will be yk compliant  we cannot guarantee this nor can we estimate at this time any material effect on our company and its operations if this would not be the case 
the company continues its aggressive assessment of these potential third party exposures and will address the issues accordingly 
this is a known uncertainty and is currently not estimable 
however  our ability to achieve these dates may be impacted by i the timely availability of software patches by existing suppliers of software  ii the company s ability to employ and retain qualified professionals to handle year issues  iii the ability of third parties to complete their own year compliance remediation efforts on a timely basis  and iv the company s ability to prepare and implement contingency plans

these comments are subject to  and the actual future results may be impacted by  the cautionary limitations and factors outlined in the following narrative comments
