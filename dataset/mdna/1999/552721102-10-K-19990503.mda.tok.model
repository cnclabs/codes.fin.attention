as a result  such systems may not correctly recognize the year  which could cause computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results 
the company recognizes this as a potential risk and has implemented a plan to address the year issue 
the company s state of readiness the company has instituted an internally managed year plan to identify  test and correct potential year problems  including non information technology systems and impacts from outside parties including suppliers  customers  and service providers 
the company s efforts have included obtaining vendor certifications  direct inquiry with outside parties  and the performance of internal testing on software products and controls 
although the company can provide no assurances that all year problems will be identified  the company expects to be year compliant as of december  costs to address the company s year issues the costs incurred by the company related to the year issue were the time spent by employees to address this issue and the costs of outside contractors to provide assistance with programming 
the total year costs have not been and are not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as of march   total costs of outside services to reach year compliance were estimated to be  the risks of the company s year issues the company s primary risk with respect to the year issue is the inability of external parties to provide goods and services in a timely  accurate manner  resulting in production delays and added costs while pursuing alternative sources 
while there can be no guarantee that the systems of other parties on which the company s operations rely will be year compliant  the company believes that the performance of the year plan and the contingency plans will ensure that this risk will not have a material adverse impact to the company 
the company s contingency plans the company has completed contingency plans that address recovery of its critical information systems 
ongoing updates to these plans will continue throughout  and will consider the company s ability to perform certain processes manually  repair or obtain replacement systems  change suppliers and or service providers  and work around affected operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is mitigated through several means maintenance of local production facilities in the markets served  invoicing of customers in the same currency as the source of the products and limited use of foreign currency denominated debt 
the company occasionally utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposure to exchange rate risks 
the forward contracts are short term in duration  generally one year or less 
the major currency exposure hedged by the company is the canadian dollar 
the contract amounts  carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts were not significant at january   and the implementation of the euro currency on january  is not expected to materially affect the company s foreign currency exchange risk profile  although some customers may require the company to invoice or pay in euros rather than the functional currency of the manufacturing entity 
interest rate risk exposure is principally limited to the  of long term debt outstanding at january  essentially all of these borrowings are fixed rate debt and  therefore  the impact on the company s cash flows and results of operations from changes in interest rates would not be material
