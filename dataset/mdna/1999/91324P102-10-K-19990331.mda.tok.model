item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations financial performance highlights was an important year of both challenges and successes for unitedhealth group 
excluding the effects of the unusual or nonrecurring events and transactions described below  we achieved record profits 
underlying earnings from operations  net earnings applicable to common shareholders  and diluted net earnings per common share were million  million and per share  respectively  representing increases over of   and  respectively 
we achieved record revenues of billion  a increase over this growth was driven primarily by same store enrollment growth in our unitedhealthcare business and from successful implementation of our billion medicare supplement insurance program with the aarp 
record cash flows of more than billion were generated from operating activities  a increase over we completed several financing initiatives to achieve a more efficient capital structure  including the redemption of our million convertible preferred stock and the repurchase of million shares of our common stock 
we embarked on a major realignment of our operations into independent but strategically linked businesses  each focused on performance  growth and shareholder value 
as a result of our evaluation of each business s strategic fit and contributions  analysis of our profitability in certain markets  and the adequacy of our medical costs payable estimates  we took actions that resulted in special operating charges of million 
operating results overview the following table summarizes our results for each of the last three years ended december in millions  except per share amounts 
earnings loss from operations net earnings loss applicable to common shareholders diluted net earnings loss per common share medical costs to premium revenues sg a expenses to total revenues excluding the effects of million of operational realignment and other charges  million of charges related to contract losses associated with certain medicare markets and other increases to commercial and medicare medical costs payable estimates  and the million convertible preferred stock redemption premium  earnings from operations  net earnings applicable to common shareholders  and diluted net earnings per common share would have been million  million  and per share  respectively 
excluding the effects of a million provision for future losses on two large multi year contracts and million of merger costs associated with the acquisition of healthwise of america  inc  earnings from operations  net earnings applicable to common shareholders  and diluted net earnings per common share would have been million  million  and per share  respectively 
includes million of contract losses associated with certain medicare markets and other increases to commercial and medicare medical costs payable estimates 
the company s ratio of medical costs to premium revenues for the year ended december   would have been without these charges 
in  we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million  or diluted net loss per common share 
however  these results include certain large or unusual events and transactions as described below in conjunction with our realignment and other initiatives  we recorded million of charges to operations during the second quarter of the charges included million of asset impairments and million of estimated future costs associated with our initiatives  such as employee terminations  disposing of or discontinuing business units  product lines and contracts  and consolidating certain processing operations and associated real estate obligations 
although our realignment initiatives and the associated nonrecurring charges caused us to report a net loss for  these actions position us to make long term fundamental process and performance improvements 
our second quarter medical costs include million related to contract losses and other increases to medical costs payable estimates in unitedhealthcare s medicare markets and million related to increases to medical costs payable estimates associated with increased commercial medical costs in certain health plans 
in conjunction with the redemption of our million convertible preferred stock  we paid a million redemption premium 
this premium is added to s net loss to arrive at net loss applicable to common shareholders 
excluding the effects of the events and transactions described above  underlying earnings from operations and diluted net earnings per common share were million and per share  respectively  representing increases of over earnings from operations of million and diluted net earnings per common share of in these increases were primarily driven by improved margins in the commercial product offerings of our unitedhealthcare business and successful integration and management of our services provided to the aarp  which began on january  the discussion that follows provides a more detailed analysis of our  and operating results 
ii results compared to results revenues and enrollment was a record year for unitedhealth group  with consolidated revenues of billion  an increase of billion  or  over our revenue growth was primarily derived from successful implementation of our billion medicare supplement insurance program with the aarp and same store enrollment growth in our unitedhealthcare business 
on a year over year same store basis  unitedhealthcare s total revenues increased by billion  or  over the following table summarizes enrollment in all of our product offerings as of december enrollment summary amount increase decrease amount increase decrease amount enrollment  excluding ovations as of december  in thousands unitedhealthcare risk based health plans    other network based and indemnity total commercial    medicare medicaid total risk based    fee based commercial    total unitedhealthcare    uniprise risk based fee based    total uniprise    total enrollment  excluding ovations    enrollment information includes growth resulting from our acquisition of healthpartners of arizona  inc  members 
additionally  the fee based lives served by united healthcare administrators  inc are included in  members 
we sold united healthcare administrators  inc on june  our revenues are comprised of premium revenues associated with our risk based products those where we assume financial responsibility for health care costs  management services and fees associated with administrative services only customers  managed health plans  and our specialized care services and ingenix businesses  and investment and other income 
the discussion that follows provides an analysis of our revenue trends for each of our three revenue components 
premium revenues the following table summarizes premium revenues by business unit for the years ended december in millions percent increase decrease unitedhealthcare   ovations  nm uniprise specialized care services elimination of inter unit transactions nm nm not meaningful consolidated premium revenues in totaled billion  an increase of billion  or  compared to on january   our ovations business began delivering medicare supplement insurance and other medical insurance coverage to approximately million aarp members 
premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings during were billion 
excluding the aarp business  consolidated premium revenues totaled billion  an increase of over this increase is primarily the result of growth in our unitedhealthcare business 
on a year over year same store basis  unitedhealthcare s premium revenues increased billion  or  during the increase reflects same store commercial health plan enrollment growth of and average year over year premium yield increases on renewing commercial health plan groups of approximately to 
growth in unitedhealthcare s medicare programs also contributed to the increase in premium revenues  with same store growth of in medicare enrollment 
significant growth in medicare enrollment affects year over year comparability 
the medicare product generally has per member premium rates three times to four times higher than average commercial premium rates because medicare members typically use proportionately more medical care services 
on a year over year same ii store basis  unitedhealthcare s commercial health plan and medicare products accounted for billion of premium revenue growth during the increase in unitedhealthcare s commercial health plan and medicare product premium revenues was partially offset by a million decrease from other network based and indemnity products 
we expect enrollment in unitedhealthcare s other network based and indemnity products will continue to decline through to the extent possible  we will convert these enrollees to unitedhealthcare s commercial health plan products 
management services and fee revenues management services and fee revenues during totaled billion  representing an increase of approximately million over the increase is primarily the result of acquisitions by ingenix during and additionally  our specialized care services business most notably united behavioral health and optum  registered trademark our telephone and internet based health information and services business continues to increase the number of individuals it serves 
investment and other income investment and other income increased to million in from million in the increase of million is primarily attributable to an increase in average cash and investments from billion in to billion in net capital gains were million in both and medical costs the combination of our pricing strategy and medical management efforts is reflected in the medical care ratio medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues 
the following table summarizes our medical care ratio by product line for the years ended december unitedhealthcare commercial medicare medicaid total unitedhealthcare consolidated unitedhealth group consolidated excluding aarp includes commercial health plan  other network based and indemnity products 
our consolidated medical care ratio increased to in from in the year over year increase includes the effects of the aarp business on our medical care ratio 
we experience a medical care ratio of approximately related to our portion of the aarp insurance offerings  which we began delivering on january  excluding the aarp business  on a year over year basis  the medical care ratio increased to 
the increase in the medical care ratio is primarily attributable to average medicare premium rate increases of that were more than offset by increased medical utilization  reflected mostly in hospital costs 
in of our medicare markets  representing half of our annual medicare premiums of billion  we incurred contract losses of million 
six of these markets are generally newer markets where we have been unable to achieve the scale of operations necessary to achieve profitability 
in numerous counties in the other seven markets  we experienced high medical costs which exceeded the fixed medicare premiums that increased only on average 
we are addressing our medicare medical care ratio by altering benefit designs  recontracting with providers  and aggressively increasing both contemporaneous and retrospective claim management activities 
we also are continuing to evaluate the markets we serve and products we offer 
in addition  we will curtail activities or exit markets where we believe near term prospects are unacceptable 
to that end  in october  we announced our decision to withdraw medicare product offerings from of the counties we then served 
the decision  effective january   affected approximately  or  of our medicare members 
we will continue to offer medicare products in strong and economically viable markets 
annual revenues for from medicare counties we exited were approximately million 
despite increasing commercial medical cost trends in certain health plan markets  unitedhealthcare s overall commercial medical care ratio improved slightly to in from in commercial health plan premium rates are established based on anticipated health care costs 
during  commercial premium yield increases averaging to minimally exceeded medical cost trends of to 
looking to  we expect average medical cost increases to remain stable in the to range  and we also expect that our medical care ratio will improve as a result of premium yield increases on new and renewal commercial business averaging to 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues the sg a ratio decreased from in to in the improvement in the year over year sg a ratio principally reflects the operating leverage we gained with the addition of the aarp business and planned cost reductions we have achieved to date from our realignment initiatives 
on an absolute dollar basis  selling  general and administrative costs increased by million  or  over this increase primarily reflects the additional infrastructure needed to support the billion  or  increase in premium based business 
depreciation and amortization was million in  and million in this increase resulted from a combination of higher levels of capital expenditures to support business growth and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to recent acquisitions 
the million of asset impairments recorded in the second quarter of will reduce depreciation and amortization by approximately million annually 
this decrease will be more than offset in by increased depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions during ii operational realignment and other charges in conjunction with our operational realignment  we developed and  in the second quarter of  approved a comprehensive plan the plan to implement our operational realignment 
we recognized corresponding charges to operations of million  which reflect the estimated costs we will incur under the plan 
the charges included costs associated with asset impairments  employee terminations  disposing of or discontinuing business units  product lines and contracts  and consolidating and eliminating certain processing operations and associated real estate obligations 
these activities will result in a net reduction of more than  positions  affecting  people in various locations 
through december   we have eliminated approximately  positions pursuant to the plan 
businesses we intend to dispose of include our managed workers compensation business  and medical and behavioral health provider clinics 
markets where we plan to curtail or make changes to our operating presence include our small group health insurance business and three health plan markets that are in non strategic locations 
our original provision for operational realignment and other charges was developed based on management s best judgment and estimates at that time 
as we began to execute the plan  we adjusted certain estimates based on more current information related to the amounts to be paid for severance and lease cancellation fees 
in addition  based on continuing negotiations related to business dispositions  our original estimates for asset impairments and business disposition costs were revised 
in total  our operational realignment and other charges did not change 
the table below summarizes realignment activities for the year ended december  in millions additional charges incurred recorded charges accrual at provision credits cash noncash year end provision for operational realignment and other charges asset impairments severance and outplacement costs noncancelable lease obligations dispositions of business and other costs total provision we have included in asset impairments the write off of million of purchased in process research and development associated with the acquisition of medicode  inc the in process projects were focused on the continued development and evolution of next generation medical databases and software solutions including clinical editing software  benchmarking databases and technologies 
these technologies upon completion will enable both healthcare payers and providers to use the same data generated in the treatment documentation process to then be used in the financial transaction process  which involves provider compensation  care utilization review  trend analysis and management reporting 
as of the date of acquisition  medicode had invested million in the in process projects identified above 
we estimate that it will be necessary to dedicate approximately million over the next sixteen months in order to successfully complete these projects 
details of the asset impairments are as follows in millions triggering event expected disposal disposal date unitedhealthcare intangible and operating a decision to exit or operating assets will be the carrying value assets of certain health plan and small reconfigure these abandoned or disposed of the assets will group insurance markets businesses  markets of upon exit or be depreciated and products

with physical disposal during either the fourth quarter of or the first six months of total we believe the aggregate reduction in our overall cost structure from our realignment and other cost reduction activities will approximate million annually by the end of the year we expect to realize approximately million of these reductions in the operational realignment charges do not cover certain aspects of the plan  including new information systems  data conversions  process re engineering and employee relocation and training 
these costs will be charged to expense as incurred or capitalized  as appropriate 
results compared to results premium revenues during  consolidated premium revenues totaled billion  representing an increase of billion  or  compared to excluding the effects of acquisitions  premium revenues in increased by over the increase in premium revenues in was primarily due to growth in year over year same store commercial health plan revenues of billion  or 
the increase reflected same store commercial health plan enrollment growth of and ii average year over year premium rate increases on renewing commercial groups of approximately 
growth in our medicare programs also contributed to the increase in premium revenues  with a year over year same store increase of in medicare enrollment 
the year over year increase in premium revenues from commercial and medicare products was partially offset by a million decrease from non network based indemnity products 
nearly million of this decrease resulted because we discontinued our relationship with a broker who sold and administered small group indemnity business on our behalf  which led to the loss of  indemnity members effective july  the remaining decrease was from declining enrollment in these products  which is attributed to average rate increases of to that started in and continued into  as well as other business factors 
management services and fee revenues management services and fee revenues in totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase resulted from enrollment growth within managed health plans and an increase in individuals served by our specialized care services business 
offsetting these increases  fee revenues from self funded products decreased million because of declining enrollment in these products 
in addition  the june   sale of our subsidiary  united healthcare administrators  inc  resulted in a million decrease in these revenues in compared to investment and other income investment and other income increased to million in from million in the increase of million is primarily attributable to an increase in average cash and investments from billion in to billion in additionally  investment and other income included net capital gains of million compared with million in medical costs during  the medical care ratio increased slightly from in before nonrecurring charges to 
the increase in the medical care ratio was the result of several factors a few specific health plan markets had medical care ratios substantially higher than our other health plans in the aggregate 
the reasons varied from plan to plan  but generally  medical cost controls and provider contracting initiatives were not being fully implemented and commercial premium yields were insufficient compared to corresponding medical costs 
several markets had recently introduced medicare products  which had been well received and were growing rapidly 
we generally experience higher medical care ratios during the early stage of medicare product introductions 
medicaid premiums did not increase and  in fact  decreased in several markets 
operating expenses during  our sg a ratio improved from in to 
the improvement in the sg a ratio reflected ongoing operating efficiencies as well as our diligence in managing operating expenses 
on an absolute dollar basis  selling  general and administrative costs increased million in  or  over this increase reflects the additional infrastructure needed to support the billion increase in premium based business  as well as the additional investment in new medicare markets and increased support for our growing specialized care services businesses 
financial condition and liquidity as of december  during  we generated more than billion in cash from operating activities 
we continued to maintain a strong financial condition and liquidity position  with cash and investments of billion at december   an increase of million over december  our long term investments  billion as of december   are classified as available for sale and are periodically sold prior to their maturity date to fund working capital or for other purposes 
during  we also took several actions to improve our capital structure we redeemed million of convertible preferred stock with a cumulative dividend rate of a pre tax effective rate of approximately 
the redemption of the preferred shares was financed with million of unsecured notes payable at a weighted average pre tax effective interest rate of  thereby decreasing our financing cost for this million by in the first year 
the debt placement consisted of million in unsecured notes due december  with an interest rate of  and million in unsecured notes due december  with an interest rate of 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of million  an average cost of approximately per share 
under our stock repurchase program  we may purchase up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
purchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices  subject to certain restrictions relating to volume  pricing and timing 
we established a million commercial paper program  which provides increased flexibility in managing our capital structure 
at december   there were million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 
in support of our commercial paper program  we entered into a million credit arrangement with a group of banks 
the agreement is comprised of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million day credit facility 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of december  ii in january  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to sell up to million of debt securities and preferred or common shares 
the shelf filing registered the securities and allows us to sell them from time to time in the event we need financing 
proceeds from sales of these securities may be used for a variety of general corporate purposes  including working capital  securities repurchases and acquisitions 
in october  we filed another shelf registration statement to sell up to billion of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  depository shares  warrants and trust preferred securities 
these securities may not be sold until the sec declares the registration statement effective 
cash generated from operating activities and proceeds received from our financing activities were used to redeem outstanding preferred stock  repurchase common stock  and for other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
we expect our available cash and investment resources  operating cash flows  and financing capability to be sufficient to meet our current operating requirements and other corporate development initiatives 
as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions  many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations 
after taking into account these regulations  approximately million of our billion of cash and investments at december   was available for general corporate use  including working capital needs 
the company s debt arrangements and credit facilities contain various covenants  the most restrictive of which place limitations on secured and unsecured borrowings and require the company to exceed minimum interest coverage levels 
at december   we were well within the requirements of all debt covenants 
in the second quarter of  we recognized special charges to operations of million associated with the implementation of our operational realignment plan 
we believe our after tax cash outlay associated with these charges will be in the range of million to million over the next months 
currently  we do not have any other material definitive commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products and programs and may include acquisitions 
government regulation our primary business  offering health care coverage and health care management services  is heavily regulated at the federal and state levels 
we strive to comply in all respects with applicable regulations and may be required to make changes from time to time in our services  products  marketing methods or organizational or capital structure 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change from time to time 
these changes could affect our operations and financial results 
certain proposed changes in medicare and medicaid programs may improve opportunities to enroll people under products developed for these populations 
other proposed changes could limit available reimbursement and increase competition in those programs  with adverse effects on our financial results 
also  it could be more difficult for us to control costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and onerous managed care laws and regulations 
among the legislative proposals are proposals that could expand health plan liability or increase medical expenses 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa may represent the most significant federal reform of employee benefit law since the enactment of the employee retirement income security act erisa in significant provisions of hipaa include guaranteeing the availability of health insurance for certain employees  limiting the use of preexisting condition exclusions  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of health status  and making it easier to continue coverage in cases where a person is terminated or changes employers 
under hipaa and other similar state laws  medical cost control through amended provider contracts and improved preventive and chronic care management may become more important 
we believe our experience in these areas will allow us to compete effectively 
a comprehensive set of claims regulations has been proposed by the united states department of labor dol that could have a significant impact on the company 
these regulations are applicable to employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
in addition to various other requirements  the regulations would create new time frames for processing claims and giving notification of incomplete claims  would impose certain notification requirements following a claim determination  and would impose certain post appeal disclosure obligations on the company s insured and self funded business 
the dol has solicited public comment on the proposals  and the regulations  if adopted  could vary significantly from the proposals 
health care fraud and abuse has become a top priority for the nation s law enforcement entities  which have focused on participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare  medicaid and the federal employees health benefits program fehbp 
we participate extensively in these programs 
we also are subject to governmental investigations and enforcement actions 
included are actions relating to erisa  which regulates insured and self insured health coverage plans offered by employers  the fehbp  medicare and medicaid  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and laws relating to care management and health care delivery 
government actions could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including exclusion from participation in government programs 
we currently are involved in various government investigations and audits  but we do not believe the results will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
ii regulatory capital and dividend restrictions the company s operations are conducted through united healthcare corporation  its wholly owned subsidiary united healthcare services  inc and their respective subsidiaries  which consist principally of health maintenance organizations hmos and insurance companies 
hmos and insurance companies are subject to state regulations that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by regulated insurance and hmo companies  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
as of december   the company s regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately billion  compared with their aggregate minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of million 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to the company or united healthcare services  inc  by their insurance and hmo subsidiaries at december   without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited to approximately million 
there are no such restrictions on distributions from united healthcare services  inc to the company or on distributions from the company to its shareholders 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which  to the extent that they are implemented by the states  will set new minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies  hmos and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
the change in rules for insurance companies was effective december  the new hmo rules are subject to state by state adoption  but few states had adopted the rules as of december  the hmo rules  if adopted by the states in their proposed form  would significantly increase the capital required for certain of our subsidiaries 
however  we believe we can redeploy capital among our regulated entities to minimize the need for incremental capital investment of general corporate financial resources into regulated subsidiaries 
as such  we do not anticipate a significant impact on our aggregate capital or investments in regulated subsidiaries 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and commercial premiums receivable may subject unitedhealth group to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed by professional investment managers within an investment policy authorized by the board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to commercial premiums receivable are limited to the large number of employer groups that comprise our customer base 
as of december   there were no significant concentrations of credit risk 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since the date of the company s quarterly report filed on form q for the quarter ended september   no material changes have occurred in the company s exposure to market risk associated with our investments in market risk sensitive financial instruments 
we do not believe that our risk of a loss in future earnings or a decline in fair values or cash flow attributable to such investments is material 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and health care cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national health care cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation  including setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs  risk sharing arrangements with various health care providers  and other health care cost containment measures 
specifically  health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new health care product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost increases 
in addition  certain non network based products do not have health care cost containment measures similar to those in place for network based products 
as a result  there is added health care cost inflation risk with these products 
year activities our business depends significantly on effective information systems  and we have many different information systems for our various businesses 
our information systems require ongoing enhancements to keep pace with the continuing changes in information technology  evolving industry standards  and customer preferences 
we have been modifying our computer systems to accommodate the year the year problem exists throughout the global marketplace  as many computer systems and applications were developed to recognize the year as a two digit number  with the digits being recognized as the year starting in  our formal year project office began implementing a remediation plan so that critical information systems applications  end user developed application tools  and business interfaces remain intact and can function properly through the century change 
we are on schedule to complete  test and certify our year remediation efforts by september  a more detailed description and current status of our year activities follows 
ii technical infrastructure mainframe technology in conjunction with our two vendors that provide support for our data center operations  we have completed  tested and certified of our remediation efforts for the hardware  operating system and supporting software remediation efforts on our two primary mainframe computer systems 
in addition  we are in the process of reviewing some of our smaller mainframe systems and making modifications as necessary 
we expect to be complete with all mainframe hardware and software technology year modifications by march  we also have installed separate test environments both mainframe and distributed to test our business applications in a simulated year environment 
desktop hardware and software we have inventoried all of our desktop hardware and software more than  computing devices of multiple makes and models 
all noncompliant desktop hardware and software have been identified and are being modified or replaced with compliant systems by september  telecommunications we have inventoried all of our telecommunication systems more than  telecommunication devices  including traffic routers and phone switches 
we are using two outside vendors to assist us in modifying or replacing noncompliant telecommunication systems 
as of december   we were approximately year compliant with our data and voice networks 
we expect all of our telecommunication networks and devices will be year compliant by september  business applications critical software applications we use different software applications that include more than million lines of computer code 
we have surveyed our software applications and have identified systems that will not be used after december   and systems that will be modified for year compliance 
we have determined that of our software applications will not be used after december   due to conversions  consolidations and software replacements 
of the remaining applications  over have been made year compliant  tested and certified or are scheduled to be certified for compliance 
the balance of the applications are yet to be tested 
we expect all critical year software modifications to be completed by march   with further testing and certification during the remainder of end user developed applications end user developed applications are analysis tools that have been internally developed by individual employees or operating segments primarily running on personal computers or client servers 
the year project office has continuously communicated with all employees explaining the risks of noncompliant applications and provided tools and techniques to make them compliant 
we have identified and are tracking and assessing year compliance issues with respect to all potentially critical end user applications 
other year matters non information technology systems we have approximately owned or leased facilities throughout the world 
we have contacted all of our facility managers regarding year compliance issues 
in addition  we have contracted with a real estate management company to assist in our year compliance efforts 
all facilities are scheduled to be year compliant by september  dependence on third parties we use approximately  different medical providers and more than  vendors 
approximately  vendors have been identified as critical business partners and suppliers 
we are currently in communication with these critical business partners to analyze their year compliance efforts 
we expect to complete our analysis of critical vendor readiness and identify alternative vendors  where necessary  by july  we will not be individually contacting all of the  medical providers with whom we conduct business regarding year compliance issues 
however  we will be testing and verifying the electronic collection of data with our providers through our edi electronic data interface clearinghouse vendors 
costs of year compliance the projected costs of our year compliance efforts and the date on which we plan to complete the necessary year remediation efforts are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using various assumptions of future events 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ significantly from our current plans 
specific factors that might cause significant differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct the relevant computer codes  and the ability of our significant vendors  providers  customers  and others with whom we conduct business to identify and resolve their own year issues 
costs associated with modifying internal use software for year compliance are charged to expense as incurred 
purchases of hardware or software that replace existing hardware or software that is not year compliant are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   our historical and projected costs to complete our year remediation plan were as follows in millions expenses incurred to date projected expenses resources depreciation resources depreciation total ii business risks of noncompliant systems although we are committed to completing and testing our remediation plan well in advance of the year  there are risks if we do not meet our objectives by december  operationally  the most severe risk is business interruption 
specific examples of situations that could cause business interruption include  but are not limited to computer hardware or application software processing errors or failures  facilities or infrastructure failures  or critical outside providers  suppliers  or customers who may not be year compliant 
depending on the extent and duration of business interruption resulting from noncompliant year systems  such interruption may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
contingency plans each area of our year compliance effort is currently developing contingency plans to mitigate the risk of failure  and to provide for a speedy recovery from possible failures associated with the century change 
the contingency plans detail strategies to implement in to prepare for the century rollover  and actions to execute if problems emerge 
the target date for completion of the initial contingency plans is april  contingency plans will be final by july  legal matters six suits assert claims under the us securities laws against unitedhealth group and certain of its current and former officers and directors 
the plaintiffs are shareholders of the company who purport to sue on behalf of a class of purchasers of the company s common shares during the period february   through august  the class period 
each complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of minnesota 
each of the six actions claims violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act and sec rule b in substance  the complaints allege that the company made materially false or misleading statements about the profitability and performance of the company s medicare business during the class period 
two of the complaints also allege that the company made materially false statements about its medical costs and the expenses related to its realignment 
the complaints also allege that the statements were made with the intention of deceiving members of the investing public and with the intention that the price of the company s shares would rise  making it possible for insiders at the company to profit by selling shares at a time when they knew the company s true financial condition  but the investing public did not 
the complaints allege that once the company s true financial condition was revealed on august   the price of its common shares fell from a closing price of per share on august   to a closing price of per share on august  the complaints seek compensatory damages in unspecified amounts 
on january   we received a consolidated amended complaint in re united healthcare corporation securities litigation  no 
in the united states district court for the district of minnesota for the six suits  which essentially restates the allegations made in the earlier complaints 
on march   two actions were filed in the united states district court for the district of minnesota by two pension funds against united  certain current and former officers and directors  and other individuals yet to be identified 
the pension funds wish to opt out of the aforementioned purported class action suits 
these individual actions essentially restate the allegations made in the purported class actions and claim violations of sections b  a and of the securities exchange act 
in addition  both actions assert a claim of negligent misrepresentation and securities claims under state law 
in the aggregate  the plaintiff pension funds seek compensatory damages totaling approximately million 
we intend to defend these actions vigorously 
we are also involved in other legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
although we cannot predict the outcomes of legal actions  it is our opinion that the resolution of all currently pending or threatened actions  including the class action lawsuit described above  will not have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations
