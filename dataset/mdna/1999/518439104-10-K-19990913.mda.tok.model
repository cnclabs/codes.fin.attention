hair care and makeup benefited from a full year of sales of aveda and jane products 
new skin care products were well received driving growth in that category 
internationally  the europe  middle east africa region contributed a increase in net sales over the prior year 
foreign currency translation did not significantly impact net sales 
product categories skin care skin care sales increased to  million  reflecting the launch of stop signs and resilience lift and a full year of sales of diminish internationally 
in addition to these increases  clinique all about eyes contributed to the category s year over year improvement 
the overall increase was partially offset by lower net sales of fruition extra 
makeup net sales of makeup products increased to  million due in part to the inclusion of a full year of sales of aveda and jane products 
the current year launch of quickliner for eyes  superfit makeup and sheer powder blusher increased sales  and two in one eyeshadow  doublewear and photochrome experienced continued success 
these increases were partially offset by the anniversary of the fiscal launch of superlast cream lipstick 
fragrance fragrance sales increased to  million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the worldwide success of clinique happy and the current year introduction of dazzling gold and dazzling silver 
the rollout of hilfiger athletics and tommy girl into remaining international markets contributed to higher fragrance sales  offset in part by lower sales of tommy 
hair care net sales of hair care products increased million or to million 
this increase primarily reflects the inclusion of aveda products for a full year 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalization effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic sales in the americas were  million representing a increase 
the region benefited from the inclusion of a full year of sales of aveda and jane products as well as strong sales from new skin care products 
net sales in europe  the middle east africa increased to  million with double digit sales increases in the skin care and fragrance categories 
net sales in spain  the united kingdom  italy  germany  france  belgium and the distributor and travel retail businesses all increased as we introduced new products and rolled out products that were previously not available in the region 
in asia pacific  net sales increased to million  primarily due to higher net sales in japan  korea and thailand  offset by slightly lower sales in australia and hong kong 
currency translation did not have a material impact on any of these geographic segments 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic markets  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales was in each of the last two years  reflecting the integration of aveda and jane products  which have higher product cost structures than our other brands  offset by continued cost reduction efforts and a shift in product mix for our core brands 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease is the result of productivity gains in advertising and promotional spending and other cost controls  partially offset by a full year of goodwill amortization and incremental spending related to our year remediation program 
shifts in product mix and the timing and type of new product introductions affect our level of selling  advertising and promotional spending 
in addition to these market influences  our ratio of operating expenses to net sales benefited from the integration of favorable operating cost structures of acquired companies 
operating income operating income increased to million and operating margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases were achieved by maintaining our gross profit margins and controlling certain operating expenses so they increased at a lower rate than net sales 
product categories operating income in the skin care category increased to million due primarily to the launches of stop signs and resilience lift 
skin care products  which are primarily marketed under our core brand names  typically have lower cost of goods than our other products 
operating income for makeup increased to million as a result of higher sales from new product introductions including quickliner for eyes  superfit makeup and sheer powder blusher 
operating income for fragrance products was million  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales from the introduction of dazzling gold and dazzling silver and the continued success of clinique happy 
operating income from fragrances as a percent of net sales is typically lower than other product segments as fragrance products generally have a higher cost of goods and are often supported by higher advertising and promotional spending 
the higher advertising and promotion for fragrance indirectly supports other categories by generating increased traffic at points of sale 
operating income from the hair care category increased to million primarily due to the inclusion of aveda products for a full year 
geographic operating income in the americas increased to million primarily due to increased sales in the skin care and makeup segments  as well as a full year of operating profits from aveda 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased to million as a result of a strong travel retail business and better operating results in spain  germany  italy and belgium  partially offset by lower results in the united kingdom 
in asia pacific  operating income increased million or to million due to increased sales and the implementation of planned operating expense efficiencies in japan  australia  taiwan and thailand 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is an additional measure of operating performance used by management 
ebitda  like operating income  does not include the effects of interest and taxes and additionally excludes the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization on current earnings 
while the components of ebitda may vary from company to company  we exclude minority interest adjustments  all depreciation charges related to property  plant and equipment and all amortization charges including amortization of goodwill  purchased royalty rights  leasehold improvements and other intangible assets 
these components of operating income do not necessarily result in a capital requirement in the current period  and  in the opinion of management  many of the underlying assets  both tangible and intangible  create value by supporting the global recognition of brand names and product innovation and by consistently producing quality products for our customers and consumers 
while we consider ebitda useful in analyzing our results  it is not intended to replace  or act as a substitute for  any presentation included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda increased by million to million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal such improvement is primarily attributable to higher net sales and operating expense efficiencies achieved 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased million to million as borrowings related to fiscal business acquisitions were outstanding for the full year 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was compared to in the prior year period 
these rates are higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the effect of state and local taxes  higher tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was principally attributable to tax planning initiatives and the tax effect of foreign operations 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales in fiscal increased to  million as compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased as a result of new product introductions  the continued success of our core products  and the international rollout of existing products 
additionally  net sales in fiscal benefited from the inclusion of aveda and jane from the date of acquisition in december and october  respectively  through the fiscal year end 
the strength of the us dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products in fiscal decreased to  million as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the asia pacific region and the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
accordingly  net sales of skin care products increased on a constant exchange rate basis 
additionally  fiscal decreases were due in part to the successful fiscal launch of fruition extra and lower year to year sales of advanced night repair 
partially offsetting these decreases were sales related to the introduction of diminish  uncircle and clinique all about eyes  the international introduction of nutritious and the continued success of daywear 
makeup net sales of makeup products increased to  million in fiscal the increase was attributable to the introduction of new products such as superbalanced makeup  superlast cream lipstick  two in one eyeshadow and blush all day 
in addition to new product introductions  existing products such as doublewear and futurist recorded a full year s sales and were introduced internationally  while sales of true lipstick improved for the third straight year 
net sales of makeup also reflect sales of jane and aveda after they were acquired and the continued success of bobbi brown essentials 
the foregoing increases were partially offset by the successful fiscal introduction and full year s sales of city base  and the decline in net sales of long last lipstick 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of clinique happy and lauder pleasures for men  the domestic introduction of hilfiger athletics  and the on going success of tommy and tommy girl 
sales of estee lauder pleasures and beautiful were relatively consistent with prior years  although they continued to generate significant sales 
offsetting these improvements were declines in existing products such as white linen breeze  aramis classic  and havana pour elle 
hair care net sales of hair care products increased significantly in fiscal as compared with the prior year due to the inclusion of sales from the aveda hair care product lines beginning in december geographic net sales in the americas rose to  million in fiscal increases in fiscal were recognized across all product categories in the region  with the most significant increases being attributable to fragrances and hair care as a result of new product introductions and the integration of aveda  respectively 
growth in all product categories was supported by the continued success of existing products 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased to million in fiscal net sales increased for fiscal excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
higher net sales were recorded in the united kingdom and spain 
significant sales improvements in the united kingdom were favorably impacted as the dollar weakened against the british pound 
excluding the effect of a stronger us dollar against local currencies  double digit increases were achieved in spain  italy and germany 
in asia pacific  net sales decreased to million  and  on a local currency basis  decreased 
the volatile economic climate in japan and the surrounding asian marketplace had contributed to a difficult retail environment 
sales in japan  hong kong and taiwan decreased on both a local currency and a translated basis 
partially offsetting these decreases  net sales increased in all other asia pacific markets on a local currency basis  particularly in thailand and malaysia 
cost of sales cost of sales in fiscal was of net sales compared with of net sales in fiscal increased cost of sales in fiscal related to the inclusion of aveda and jane  both of which have product cost structures higher than our other brands  as well as a shift in product mix 
this increase was partially offset by continued improvements in operating efficiency 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in fiscal  compared with of net sales in fiscal fiscal decreases reflect operating expenses growing at a slower rate than net sales primarily due to spending efficiencies achieved in the selling  advertising and promotional expense areas and the favorable effect of integrating the aveda and jane operating cost structures 
operating income operating income rose to million in fiscal operating margins were in  compared with in fiscal these increases were due to higher net sales and total operating expenses growing at a slower rate than net sales 
product categories operating income in the skin care segment decreased to milion as a result of lower sales in this category  particularly in the asia pacific region 
the makeup segment s operating income increased to million as a result of higher sales from new and existing products  as well as contributions from aveda and jane 
operating income for fragrance products increased million to million  primarily as the result of contributions from new products in addition to improved margins on existing products 
the increase in operating income in the hair care segment of million to million was primarily due to the inclusion of aveda hair care products 
geographic operating income in the americas increased by to million 
in fiscal  the increase related to continued net sales improvements in the united states due to strong performances from core products and the inclusion of aveda and jane 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased to million in fiscal increased net sales in the united kingdom resulted in the most significant improvement in operating income for the region 
on a constant exchange rate basis  spain  france and italy would have made greater operating income contributions 
these increases were partially offset by lower operating income in the travel retail business 
in asia pacific  operating income decreased to million in fiscal this decrease is principally due to operating income declines in japan due to lower net sales  compounded by a stronger us dollar against the yen 
a difficult retail market adversely affected japan and the surrounding areas 
as a result  operating expenses grew at a faster rate than net sales for most of the asian markets  partially offset by strong results in korea 
ebitda ebitda increased to of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the improvement in ebitda in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased sales and operating expense efficiencies 
interest income expense  net net interest expense was million for fiscal as compared to net interest income of million in fiscal net interest expense in fiscal is primarily due to higher borrowings associated with the company s acquisitions 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal these rates principally reflect the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was attributable to tax planning initiatives  a relative change in the mix of earnings from higher tax countries such as japan to lower tax countries  the effect of a reduction in the statutory rate in the united kingdom and the effect of us federal tax regulations 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under uncommitted and committed credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  in order to more efficiently manage our debt position and interest rate risk  the board of directors authorized a million commercial paper program 
we have issued  and intend to issue  our commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
in may  we issued million of commercial paper and used the proceeds to prepay a like amount of our million term loan  due february there remains million of the original term loan outstanding with a fixed rate of interest of 
commercial paper is classified as long term debt in our balance sheet based upon our intent and ability to refinance maturing commercial paper on a long term basis 
on august   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec covering the potential issuance of up to million in debt securities 
total committed credit facilities are million all of which are unused 
these committed credit facilities consist of i our existing million five year revolving credit facility  and  ii a day  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility  entered into in july we also have uncommitted facilities  which amounted to million  of which million was used 
total debt as a percent of total capitalization was at june  as compared to at june   primarily as a result of higher total capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these increases primarily relate to increased earnings  particularly before depreciation and amortization 
greater changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal were partially due to the acquisitions of aveda and jane 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the fiscal decrease in cash used for investing activities relates primarily to lower spending on acquisitions as compared to fiscal  when we acquired aveda  jane and the remaining interest in mac in march  we made a payment to satisfy the earn out of the bobbi brown acquisition 
additionally  in august  we acquired the business of los angeles based stila cosmetics  inc cash used for financing activities in fiscal was million as compared to million provided in fiscal and million used in fiscal these changes are primarily attributable to the fiscal issuance of debt related to business acquisitions 
fiscal financing activities reflect the shift in debt from our term loan to commercial paper  payments to acquire treasury stock  and an increase in dividends paid  due mostly to the timing of dividend distributions  partially offset by proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options 
on september   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program 
we have purchased  and may continue to purchase  over an unspecified period of time  a total of up to eight million shares of class a common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
spending in all three years primarily reflects the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology advancements  as well as incremental capital spending by acquired companies 
fiscal spending included costs related to the construction of the lachen distribution center and the purchase of a facility in blaine  minnesota 
dividends declared were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
from the third quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal the board of directors declared  and we paid  quarterly dividends at the rate of 
per share on our class a and class b common stock 
on april   the board of directors approved an increase of in the next quarterly class a and class b common stock dividend to 
per share 
in fiscal  and  dividends declared on such common stock totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge purchases  receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows which we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of these exposures are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
we also enter into purchased foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
any gains realized on such options that qualify as hedges are deferred and recognized in operating income when the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
premiums on foreign currency options are amortized over the period being hedged 
foreign currency transactions which do not qualify as hedges are marked to market on a current basis with gains and losses recognized through income and reflected in operating expenses 
in addition  any previously deferred gains and losses on hedges which are terminated prior to the transaction date are recognized in current income when the hedge is terminated 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of loss is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding months 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of purchased currency options and forward exchange contracts in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the foreign currencies included in these contracts are principally the euro  japanese yen  swiss franc and uk pound 
we have entered into interest rate swaps to convert floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
these swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
amounts currently due to or from interest swap counterparties are recorded in interest expense in the period in which they accrue 
the related amounts payable to  or receivable from  the counterparties are included in other accrued liabilities 
at june  we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional principal amount of million 
the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
derivative financial instruments we conduct business in many foreign currencies 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to the effects that foreign exchange rate movements of these currencies have on our costs and cash flows which we receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that currently there is no other material market risk exposure 
we address our risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchase foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  and  accordingly  categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk from holding such derivative instruments  using a variance co variance model with a percent confidence level  assuming normal market conditions at june  was not material 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in the portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of currency movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 
in addition  the maximum exposure associated with the purchase of options is limited to the premiums paid  which are recognized against income over the period being hedged 
year we have a comprehensive program to address year issues and are in the final stages of implementing all aspects 
the program addresses three main areas a information systems  b embedded chips  and c supply chain readiness  as well as contingency planning related thereto 
a steering committee  comprised of senior executives representing our various business units around the world  meets periodically to oversee the program  and its representatives report regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
we identified potential deficiencies related to year in our information systems and are finalizing our upgrades and other remediations 
testing is essentially completed 
we are in the process of having an independent third party validate our information systems remediation processes  the completion of which is expected in october we identified other equipment with date sensitive operating controls and have completed the assessment  remediation and testing of critical embedded chips 
we had another independent third party validate our embedded chip procedures and the validation has been completed 
to mitigate the risk of year non compliance by third parties  we have identified  contacted and met with critical inventory suppliers  our larger customers  and critical non inventory suppliers and have finalized the assessment of their year readiness and have developed our contingency plans accordingly 
we believe it is difficult to specifically identify the cause of the most reasonable worst case year scenario 
as with all manufacturers and distributors of products such as ours and based upon our work to date  a reasonable worst case scenario would be the result of the failure of third parties to be year compliant 
such failures may include  without limitation  failures by governmental entities and entities with which we have no direct involvement that continue for more than several days in various geographic areas where our products are sold at retail  or areas from which our raw materials are sourced 
accordingly  we have finalized contingency plans to limit  to the extent reasonably possible  lost revenues and other adverse effects arising from third party failures 
these plans are necessarily limited to matters which we can reasonably control and include the acceleration of certain shipments which necessitated adjustments to our production and procurement schedules 
in order to support ongoing global operations on or about january   we will be establishing  prior to that date  a yk communications center which will expedite the implementation of certain contingency plans  if necessary 
we are implementing our overall contingency plans and estimate an immaterial shift of net sales and related expenses from the third fiscal quarter to the second fiscal quarter 
notwithstanding the impact on any given quarter  incremental out of pocket costs incurred through june  have not been significant and  based upon current estimates  the costs of our year program are not expected to be material 
such costs do not include internal employee costs and costs related to the deferral of other information technology projects 
while we do not have a system to track internal employee costs specifically related to the year  those costs are not expected to be material to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our year efforts are ongoing and our overall plan  as well as the implementation of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
while we anticipate continuity of our business activities  that continuity will be dependent upon our ability  and the ability of third parties on whom we rely directly or indirectly to be year compliant 
euro conversion as part of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency the euro will replace the national currencies of most of the european countries in which we conduct business 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies were fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies to be removed from circulation between january  and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities  as well as individuals  may pay for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euros or the participating country s national currency 
under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency  there is a no compulsion  no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to use the euro until the notes and coinage have been introduced on january  in keeping with this rule  we were euro compliant able to receive euro denominated payments and able to invoice in euros as requested as of january  in the affected countries 
full conversion of all affected country operations to the euro is expected to be completed by the time national currencies are removed from circulation 
phased conversion to the euro is currently underway and the effects on revenues  costs and various business strategies continue to be assessed 
the cost of software and business process conversion is not expected to be material 
accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  and will not require retroactive restatement of prior period financial statements 
this statement requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in the fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if certain conditions are met  where the derivative instrument has been designated as a fair value hedge  the hedged item may also be marked to market through earnings thus creating an offset 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument may be recorded in comprehensive income 
based on current analysis  we believe that conversion to sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  the statement will likely result in a change in reported assets and liabilities and may affect comprehensive income 
forward looking information we and our representatives from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in this and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in our reports to stockholders 
the words and phrases will likely result  expects  believes  will continue  is anticipated  estimates  projects or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements include  without limitation  our expectations regarding sales  earnings or other future financial performance and liquidity  product introductions  entry into new geographic regions and future operations or operating results 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  we cannot assure that actual results will not differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include  without limitation i increased competitive activity from companies in the skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care businesses  some of which have greater resources than we do  ii our ability to develop  produce and market new products on which future operating results may depend  iii consolidations and restructurings in the retail industry causing a decrease in the number of stores that sell our products  an increase in the ownership concentration within the retail industry or ownership of retailers by our competitors or ownership of competitors by our customers that are retailers  iv shifts in the preferences of consumers as to where and how they shop for beauty and related products  v social  political and economic risks to our foreign manufacturing  distribution and retail operations  including changes in foreign investment and trade policies and regulations of the host countries and of the united states  vi changes in the laws  regulations and policies  including changes in accounting standards  that affect  or will affect  us in the united states and abroad  vii foreign currency fluctuations affecting our results of operations and the value of our foreign assets  the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell our products in the same market and our operating and manufacturing costs outside of the united states  viii changes in global economic conditions that could affect the cost and availability of capital to the company  which may be needed for new equipment  facilities or acquisitions  ix shipment delays  depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from disruptions of operations at any of the facilities which  due to consolidations in our manufacturing operations  now manufacture nearly all of our supply of a particular type of product ie  focus factories  x real estate rates and availability  which may affect our ability to increase the number of retail locations at which we sell our products  xi changes in product mix to products which are less profitable  xii our ability and the ability of third parties  including customers  suppliers and governmental entities to adequately address year issues  and xiii our ability to integrate acquired businesses and realize value therefrom
