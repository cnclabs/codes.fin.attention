general during march  the corporation merged krug life sciences inc and technology scientific services  inc  its two subsidiaries which comprised the ls e segment  with wyle in exchange for a equity interest in wyle 
the ls e segment is accounted for as continuing operations in fiscal years and in fiscal  the ls e segment is included in wyle s losses which are reported on the equity method of accounting as a single line item in the corporation s consolidated statement of earnings 
in april  the corporation sold its leisure marine subsidiary 
accordingly  the results of operations of the leisure marine segment are included in discontinued operations for fiscal years  and results of operations continuing operations the corporation s fiscal revenues of million declined million from million in fiscal fiscal revenues included the revenues of the ls e segment which was merged with wyle in march fiscal revenues increased million  or  over fiscal fiscal revenues of the housewares segment  which operates in the united kingdom  decreased by million to million from million for the decreased sales resulted from the discontinuance of the manufacture and sale of certain industrial and office products in march million  lower sales volume  primarily in laundry products and ladders million and the unfavorable effects of currency translation million 
during fiscal  beldray experienced significant operating inefficiencies at its bilston facility as a result of the consolidation of the manufacturing operations of hago which led to missed customer delivery schedules and the lower sales volumes 
fiscal housewares revenues increased by million from fiscal  an increase of 
hago  acquired in october  was included in fiscal for five months and added million in revenues in fiscal  and beldray s revenues increased by million  including increases in sales of child safety gates  garden products and indoor drying products  while sales of ladders and outdoor drying products decreased 
of the million increase  the favorable effect of foreign currency translation contributed million 
fiscal revenues of the child safety segment  which operates in europe  increased by million to million 
the child safety segment commenced operation with the acquisition of klippan limited and its four european subsidiaries on october  the fiscal sales included a full year s revenues versus six months for fiscal the us ls e segment was merged into wyle on march   therefore  no fiscal revenues are reported for the ls e segment 
revenues for the ls e segment were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the lower fiscal revenues resulted from decreased material purchases and labor services provided under contracts with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the us air force and  as a result of the merger  the corporation reported only eleven and one half months of revenues in fiscal subsequent to the merger  the results of operations of the ls e segment are reported as part of wyle s results on the equity method of accounting as a single line item in the corporation s consolidated statement of operations 
order backlog is not meaningful for the housewares and child safety segments due to the short time between order placement and shipment 
as a result of the merger of the ls e segment with wyle  the corporation had no order backlog at march  gross profit margins revenues less cost of goods sold were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal was due primarily to operating inefficiencies and missed customer delivery schedules of the housewares segment in connection with the consolidation of the manufacturing operations of hago into beldray s manufacturing facility 
beldray experienced lower than anticipated sales due to the disruptions from the plant consolidation as well as lower demand for its products 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal  the corporation made significant operational and organizational changes at the facility to address these operational conditions 
the corporation believes the positive effect of these changes was primarily responsible for achieving the small operating profit for housewares in the fourth quarter of fiscal the gross profit margin of the child safety segment decreased slightly from in to in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the costs of a comprehensive product redevelopment program undertaken during the year for the child safety seats 
the decrease in the gross profit margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the operating losses incurred by the housewares and child safety segments 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the housewares segment commenced the consolidation of the hago operations into the beldray facility 
this consolidation caused higher manufacturing costs including labor  material and overhead due to inefficiencies existing prior to and during the factory move  as well as disruption of the beldray operations resulting from the move 
the gross profit margin of the ls e segment decreased slightly in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of lower fees received for labor services and lower material purchases under contracts with nasa and the us air force 
selling and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in fiscal was due to the absence of ls e expenses of million and decreased housewares expenses of million offset by increased expenses of million in the child safety segment as a result of including twelve months of its operations in fiscal versus six months in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to additional costs as a result of the purchase of klippan in october  which added million of expense  the inclusion of hago s operations for a full year  which added million of expense  million of expense related to an abandoned uk acquisition and million of unfavorable foreign currency translation effect 
the corporation recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  charges of million were recorded relative to the impairment of goodwill recorded in connection with the fiscal purchase of klippan and for additional expenses of million related to the vacated hago facility in bognor regis  england 
the corporation s evaluation of the recoverability of the goodwill allocated in the purchase of klippan was pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
market conditions and the competitive environment in which klippan operates has  to date  prevented the corporation from increasing klippan s sales and operating profits to levels anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
as a result of this evaluation  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the corporation determined that klippan s unamortized goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash impairment loss of million to adjust the unamortized goodwill balance to zero 
a final settlement with its landlord in may for the vacated hago facility was reached and the additional million restructuring charge reflects such cost of the settlement 
at march   million was recorded in accrued expenses  including the amount paid in may for the final settlement of the hago facility 
in fiscal  the corporation recorded restructuring charges of million related to the housewares and child safety businesses 
the corporation closed the hago facility in bognor regis  england  and moved the operations to beldray s facility in bilston  england 
charges were provided for relocation million  employee severance million for employees and rent and related costs of the vacated facility million 
also in fiscal  the corporation relocated its german sales office and provided million for the severance for five employees and rent and other costs of its vacated office in germany 
the corporation closed its executive offices in dayton  ohio  and consolidated its headquarters in houston  texas in october during the year ended march   the corporation recorded restructuring charges of million related to severance for six employees  rent and other costs related to the vacated offices in dayton  ohio 
at march   million was included in accrued expenses for rent and other expenses payable through june  the lease termination date of the dayton  ohio office 
the corporation has recognized a portion of wyle s losses under the equity method of accounting 
the corporation recognized million and million of wyle s losses in fiscal and  respectively 
at march   the book value of the corporation s investment in wyle was zero as a result of recording a portion of wyle s losses against the carrying value of the investment 
the corporation s proportional share of losses incurred by wyle subsequent to the carrying value of the investment being reduced to zero are not recorded by the corporation but must be offset by an equal amount of earnings before future income  if any  from the investment can be recognized 
at march   the corporation s proportional share of unrecognized losses was million based upon wyle s unaudited results of operations as reported to the corporation 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal as a result of lower us debt 
in connection with the wyle merger  debt of million was assumed by wyle in march the corporation currently has no indebtedness for money borrowed in the us interest expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of million debt financing for the purchase of klippan in october interest income was million in fiscal  primarily from investment income on the short term investment of cash balances in the uk which resulted from the cash received from the sale of sowester in april other income for fiscal resulted from a pre tax gain of million on the sale of excess land in dayton  ohio 
other income for fiscal of million included a million gain resulting from the merger of the life sciences and engineering subsidiaries with wyle and a million gain from the sale of assets  primarily excess land and a building in dayton  ohio 
other income was not significant in fiscal the corporation recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the corporation provided current domestic taxes of million primarily us alternative minimum tax and million for deferred tax expense related to increased valuation allowances 
such valuation allowances adjusted the net domestic tax asset to zero based upon management s assessment that it is more likely than not that none of the domestic deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies currently available 
a substantial portion of the long term domestic tax asset relates to foreign tax credit carryforwards which can only be used to offset future foreign source income  and future foreign source income would likely generate additional foreign tax credits to offset such income 
as a result  the corporation believes the use of the foreign tax credit carryforwards is not considered likely 
an effective tax planning strategy for the use of the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other net domestic tax assets could not be formulated at this time  therefore  management considered the realization of these items less likely than not 
as a result  a valuation allowance for the full amount of these deferred tax assets has been provided 
the corporation provided foreign taxes of million for fiscal foreign taxes included an additional valuation allowance of million for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and million for uk tax prepayments 
these valuation allowance increases were offset by a million reduction in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax items  million from the sale of prepaid taxes and net operating loss carryforwards to sowester after its sale by the corporation and million of favorable effects of foreign currency translation 
the corporation recorded amounts to increase its foreign tax valuation allowance which adjusted the foreign deferred tax asset to zero at march  based upon management s assessment  it is more likely than not that none of the foreign deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies currently available 
due to a change in the uk tax law effective in april and net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income in the uk  the use of tax prepayments currently available in the uk is not considered likely 
the fiscal tax expense of million was comprised of million of us deemed dividends which are related to intercompany loans from the us subsidiary to the us parent and million of permanent foreign tax differences  offset by a reduction in tax valuation allowances of million 
the corporation reversed million of its domestic valuation allowance for deferred taxes in as a result of management s assessment that it was more likely than not that the domestic tax asset of million at march  could be realized through implementation of tax planning strategies then available to the corporation 
a valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million was established during fiscal because future use of the carryforwards was considered not likely 
the fiscal effective tax rate of was lower than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to deductible uk pension amounts which were higher than recorded pension expense 
the loss from continuing operations was million per share in fiscal compared to a loss from continuing operations of million per share in fiscal and earnings from continuing operations of million per share in fiscal the loss from continuing operations in fiscal was due to operating losses of the housewares and child safety segments  the restructuring and impairment charges of million  and million of tax expense resulting from increases in tax valuation allowances  somewhat offset by the tax benefits of the operating losses 
the fiscal loss from continuing operations was due to operating losses of the housewares and child safety segments  restructuring charges of the housewares segment and million tax expense caused primarily by the tax effect of the us deemed dividend  offset by the decreases in the us tax valuation allowance 
the fiscal loss from continuing operations was in part offset by other income generated by the gains from the wyle merger and sales of assets 
results of operations discontinued operations on april   the corporation sold its leisure marine subsidiary to a company formed by the subsidiary s management 
the purchase price of approximately million was comprised of approximately million in cash  deferred payments of approximately million which were paid during fiscal and the assumption of approximately million of debt 
as a result of the disposal  the corporation reported a gain of million under discontinued operations in fiscal in fiscal  the corporation discontinued the operations of its industrial segment and subsequently disposed of substantially all related net assets 
however  obligations remained relating to leases in knoxville  tennessee which expired december  and product liability claims for products manufactured and sold prior to the disposal of the segment 
in connection with the alleged final obligations under leases in knoxville  tennessee  the landlord filed a lawsuit in december claiming damages for certain alleged maintenance obligations on the property and requesting relief from payment of a million promissory note due to the corporation by the landlord 
in january  the corporation filed suit against the landlord to collect on the promissory note  for other damages due to breach of contract and unjust enrichment and for a declaration regarding a payment from a former sub tenant due to the corporation 
see item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k for more information regarding these lawsuits 
the corporation believes the landlord s claims are without substantial merit and intends to aggressively defend such claims and pursue collection of the note receivable 
on june   the parties executed a memorandum of understanding for the purpose of settling the litigation 
it is anticipated that the settlement details will not be completed until mid july  no gain or loss is expected to be recognized as a result of this settlement 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  the corporation recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources at march   the corporation had outstanding debt of million under a variable rate loan with a uk bank  the proceeds of which were used to purchase klippan in october the debt is payable in equal quarterly installments of million and matures in fiscal the corporation also has an outstanding term loan with a uk bank relating to the beldray manufacturing facility totaling million which requires quarterly principal payments of million and matures in fiscal the uk loan agreements are collateralized by substantially all of the corporation s uk assets  except for shares of the uk subsidiaries  and these loans include certain tangible net worth and cash flow covenants relating to the uk subsidiaries 
the corporation currently is not in compliance with certain covenants of the uk loan agreements  but has received from the bank waivers of such covenants at march  in conjunction with these loans  the corporation has agreed to maintain cash of million on deposit at the bank net of million which was offset at march  against outstanding bank overdraft balances until the uk debt can be renegotiated with new covenants more appropriate for the current operating levels 
the corporation is seeking to renegotiate its uk bank debt but believes such renegotiated bank debt  if achieved  will result in the paydown of a substantial amount of such debt and may not result in the elimination of the requirement to keep certain amounts of cash on deposit 
in addition  at march   the corporation had million of loans outstanding from finnish banks relating to the klippan finland operations of klippan 
such loans are payable in semi annual installments over four years beginning in august at march   the corporation had a cash balance of million  including million which was restricted in connection with the uk loan agreements 
approximately million of the march  cash balance represents proceeds received from the sale of sowester in april the corporation believes it has adequate financing in both the us and europe to support its current level of operations during fiscal the corporation generated cash of approximately million  million and million from operating activities for fiscal  and  respectively 
the lower amount of cash generated in resulted from the cash used to fund the fiscal net loss  net of non cash items of depreciation and amortization expense million  the gain on the sale of sowester million  charges for impairment of intangible assets million and income taxes million  together with cash generated from reduced working capital in the housewares segment 
the increase in cash generated in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased cash generated from the liquidation of the ls e segment s receivables as a result of the merger with wyle  increased cash generated from the leisure marine segment and decreased cash usage by the discontinued industrial segment 
in fiscal  the corporation expended million for property  plant and equipment  primarily for new tooling and equipment for new and redesigned products of the child safety segment

capital expenditures of million for were primarily for new equipment for the housewares segment 
in april  the corporation announced that it would repurchase for cash in the open market up to  of its common shares  and in august  the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares 
during fiscal  the corporation repurchased a total of  shares for cash of million 
the repurchased shares were retired by the corporation on april  inflation during periods of inflation and labor shortages  employee wages increase and suppliers pass along rising costs to the corporation in the form of higher prices for their raw materials and services and employee wage increases 
the corporation has not always been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing prices for its products  increasing its manufacturing efficiency or implementing cost control measures 
the corporation is unable to predict its ability to offset or control future cost increases or its ability to pass along the increased costs to customers 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact are discussed at note of the notes to consolidated financial statements at item of this annual report on form k 
impact of year some older computer programs and systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year for example  to denote 
as a result  those computer programs have software which may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this may result in computer system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  engage in manufacturing processes  or continue similar normal business activities 
state of readiness the corporation recognizes the importance of the year issues and has given high priority to the planning and implementation of year solutions  including contingency planning 
the corporation has underway a year project to identify the programs and infrastructure that could be affected by the year issues and is implementing a plan to resolve on a timely basis the problems identified 
the corporation s year plan generally may be broken into five interrelated phases i evaluating existing information technology it and non it systems of the corporation  ii implementing corrective actions to such systems including testing  where appropriate  iii evaluating the corporation s exposure to third parties failures to adequately address year issues  iv developing contingency plans with respect to such exposure  and v on going vigilance with respect to year developments 
as mentioned  the scope of the year project includes i it systems such as software and hardware  ii non it systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various manufacturing systems  and iii the readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers  and electronic data interchange with those key third parties 
the evaluation phase of the year project includes identifying it and non it systems or components that might malfunction or fail as a result of the year issues 
the corporation currently has three primary operating locations bilston  england  carlisle  england and helsinki  finland and each location has a designated person responsible for coordinating year issues for that location 
at the largest location  bilston  england  the it system is less than two years old and the information technology system  when purchased  was reviewed for year compliance 
the other two locations are smaller and will require new it systems primarily local area networks for approximately users at each location 
such new it systems will be installed by the end of the non it systems identified are primarily manufacturing and assembly systems which will require testing for year compliance 
key third parties are being contacted to minimize the disruptions in the relationship between the corporation and such third parties because of the year issues 
while the corporation cannot guarantee compliance of third parties  the corporation will consider alternate sources of supply in the event a key supplier cannot demonstrate its systems or products are year compliant 
the year project requires the corporation to devote considerable internal resources and hire consultants to assist with the implementation and monitoring of the plan  and will require the replacement of certain equipment and replacement or modification of certain software 
the corporation will also be working with its customers and suppliers to ensure business continuity during the potential problem period 
in order to validate systems for year readiness both it and non it systems  the corporation has performed a number of procedures  each as appropriate for the system being verified 
for it systems  the corporation has  where it is able  simulated the date change to year issues by resetting the system date to december  and then monitoring the effects of the date changes 
for non it systems  the corporation has been in correspondence with the vendor or manufacturer and sought verification from them that the system has been tested and not failed under year conditions 
where the corporation has any doubt about the system s ability to deal correctly with year issues  contingency planning has been performed to evaluate the impact on the business  alternatives to the system in question have been discussed and the need for replacement considered 
in addition  the manufacturers of all equipment containing embedded circuitry purchased since november have confirmed to the corporation that such equipment was year compliant before the equipment was accepted 
the corporation has tested all it systems and all of the non it systems that can be tested  but the non it systems tested account for only approximately of all non it systems that may be affected by year issues 
the state of completion of each of the five phases and the corporation s action plan is as follows evaluating existing it and non it systems of the corporation this has been completed 
implementing corrective actions to such systems including testing the corporation is currently testing the systems and the testing is expected to be substantially completed by july  evaluating the corporation s exposure to third parties failures to adequately address year issues 
the corporation is currently inquiring of significant third parties as to their year preparedness 
significant suppliers  customers and service providers will be initially contacted and evaluated by july   and will continue to be evaluated as to their year preparedness 
developing contingency plans with respect to such exposure contingency plans are being formulated currently and should be completed by july  on going vigilance with respect to year developments this on going process will not be fully completed until after the significant year dates  both prior to january  and after  have passed 
costs to address the year issues the corporation currently estimates that the total cost of its year project will be approximately million  which has been or will be expensed as incurred  and will also require approximately million of capital expenditures 
these costs include approximately million of normal system software and equipment upgrades and replacements  which the corporation anticipated incurring in the ordinary course of business without regard to the year issues 
the majority of these costs will be incurred during fiscal risks to the corporation of the year issues if the corporation s plan to address the year issues is not successful or is not timely implemented  the corporation may need to devote more resources to the process and additional costs may be incurred which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
problems with the year issues encountered by the corporation s vendors and customers may also have a material adverse effect of an uncertain magnitude on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation s contingency plans at present  the corporation is not able to describe its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios because it does not presently have adequate information from its suppliers and customers and has not completed evaluating its non it systems 
the corporation has devoted  and will continue to devote  resources to address this uncertainty 
as a component of its year project  the corporation is developing contingency plans to mitigate the effects of problems experienced by it  key vendors and service providers and customers in the timely implementation of solutions to year problems 
at present  however  the corporation has not completed contingency plans  but plans to do so by july  the estimated costs of the corporation s year project and the dates by which the corporation expects to complete portions of its year compliance program are based on management s best estimates and reflect assumptions regarding the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the compliance plans of third parties  and similar uncertainties 
however  due to the complexity and pervasiveness of the year issues and  in particular  the uncertainty regarding the compliance programs of third parties  no assurance can be given that these estimates can be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union eu established fixed conversion rates through the european central bank ecb between their existing local currencies and the euro  the eu s future single currency 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the euro currently trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the corporation currently operates in three countries which adopted the euro finland  france and germany and sells from the united kingdom to certain countries which adopted the euro 
the corporation s exchange rate risk has been changed only in so far as currently it sells into germany and france from the uk and into sweden from finland  thus the corporation now has the risk of the euro as well as of the former german  finnish and french currencies 
the british pound strengthened in anticipation of the euro adoption and has continued strong compared to other european currencies 
the corporation believes the strength of the pound has adversely affected the corporation s sales from the uk to certain european countries 
the corporation does not have any derivatives exposures nor any material contracts which would be affected by the euro conversion  and is not aware of any material potential tax consequences to its operations as a result of the euro conversion 
the corporation is not aware of any significant information technology systems modification that will be required as a result of the euro conversion
