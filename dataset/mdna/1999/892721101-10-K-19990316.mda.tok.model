the company s enhanced services actual chargeback rate experience increased during the year ended november  of related gross sales when compared to the year ended november  of related gross sales

the company believes that the increase in such refunds and credits resulted from changes in local exchange carriers customer refund policies 
the local exchange carriers made such changes in response to concerns expressed by governmental regulatory authorities regarding the necessity to make it easier for customers to have charges which they claim were unauthorized removed from their telephone bills

under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions including the substantial costs associated with the company s advertising and marketing activities  management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources  including expected federal tax carryback refunds and an available financing arrangement with a service bureau  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
the company does not have any long term obligations and does not intend to incur any such obligations in the future

the company commenced significant marketing efforts under this agreement in the first quarter of fiscal  and continued marketing for the entire fiscal year ended november  during the third quarter of fiscal  at t modified its contact and customer acquisition strategies 
these modifications severely limited the company s ability to successfully market at t s long distance products to its customer database 
as a result of the at t modifications  the company significantly reduced its marketing efforts under this arrangement in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company terminated its strategic corporate partnership with at t late in the first quarter of fiscal the company concluded the qwest agreement in the first quarter of fiscal  pursuant to which the company provides marketing services to qwest  primarily through outbound telemarketing and broadcast media  directed at the acquisition of residential long distance customers for qwest

at the request of the federal communications commission  a group of the largest local exchange carriers the lecs have developed a set of voluntary best practices guidelines the guidelines with regard to the problem of cramming unauthorized  deceptive or ambiguous charges included on end user customers monthly local telephone bills 
the cramming problem has increasingly been receiving a great deal of attention from federal and state legislators  regulatory agencies  and law enforcement agencies throughout the country 
legislation is pending to combat the cramming problem 
the guidelines and legislation  if enacted  require that service providers obtain detailed and documented authorization from end users prior to billing for miscellaneous products or services 
advertising for products and services to be billed through a certain type of billing mechanism known as the billing mechanism will need to be pre approved by the lecs and clearinghouses prior to their billing 
moreover  each lec is in the process of revising its individual billing and collection agreements to implement the guidelines and further restrict the types of services for which it will provide billing services 
consequently  the lecs will have broad discretionary powers to restrict services for which the company may bill through the customer s telephone bill and assess administrative charges to service providers when a charge for a product or service not pre approved by the lec  and or authorized by the end user  is placed on the customer s bill 
as the company employs the billing mechanism to bill for products and services  the guidelines and possible legislation and lec restrictions will impact on  and need to be taken into account in  formulating the company s business practices 
the year problem at the time computer programs were first being written  two digits were used instead of four to define years on such programs 
for example  the year was written within such computer programs as 
as a result  at the onset of the new millennium  any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
this potential difficulty is commonly referred to as the yk problem 
the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify the systems that could be effected by the yk problem 
the company presently believes that its entire internal computer programs  software packages  systems and networks are yk compliant 
within the past months  the company has replaced all personal computers that were not yk compliant and rewritten its entire billing system to become compliant 
the company also recently acquired a new main database server that is compliant and that runs on a commercially available software package that is compliant 
the cost of all of the foregoing did not have a material impact on the operations of the company 
see forward looking information may prove inaccurate 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the company is reliant on third parties for the operation of the company s day to day business 
the company can not provide any assurances that the steps being taken by such third parties  if any  will be sufficient to eliminate the yk problem from the computer systems used by such third parties and relied upon by the company 
the company has corresponded with all its vendors  informing them that the company will only conduct business with those entities that are yk compliant 
in addition  the company only accepts inbound files from outside sources that define years with four digit codes  ensuring compliance 
lastly  the company s customer service department operates via the company s computer network  which is compliant 
however  in the event modifications and conversions to computer systems are required by such third parties and are not completed on a timely basis  the yk problem may have a material impact on the operations of the company
