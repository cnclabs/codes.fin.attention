year the year yk issue is a result of a global programming standard that records dates as six digits ie mm dd yy  using only the last two digits for the year 
any software application or hardware product that uses two digit fields could interpret the year as the year systems that do not properly recognize the correct year could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail  resulting in business interruption 
this situation is not limited to computers  it has the potential to affect many systems  components  and devices  which have embedded computer chips that may be date sensitive 
we are coordinating our efforts to address the yk issue with our affiliated practices  third party payors  and vendors 
we cannot assure that the systems of other companies on which our systems rely will be timely converted 
a failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with our systems could have a material adverse effect on us 
in  we established a yk coordinator to oversee all corporate wide yk initiatives 
these initiatives encompass all of our computer software and embedded systems 
teams of internal and external specialists were established to inventory and test critical computer programs and automated operational systems 
additionally  a detailed project plan has been created that outlines all activities related to the yk issue 
generally speaking  the project involves three areas corporate headquarters  affiliated practices and third party payors 
corporate headquarters because we began operations in  most of our corporate computer hardware is relatively new 
additionally  most of the software applications are off the shelf  resulting in few internal software modifications 
in the prior six month period  all significant internal applications have been reviewed and updated 
we currently anticipate that all remaining internal applications will be yk compliant by the end of the second quarter of total costs incurred by us to modify the software used at the corporate office were not material 
affiliated practices we have assessed the status of the computer systems at our affiliated practices 
based on the results of this assessment  we have determined that the majority of our affiliated practices systems are yk compliant 
the remaining practices are currently upgrading their systems or are in the testing phase 
based upon our review  and discussion with our affiliated practices  we expect all remaining affiliated practices to be compliant by the end of the second quarter of all costs to modify systems to become yk compliant have been and will be borne by the affiliated practices 
third party payors although our affiliated practices internal systems are expected to be compliant by the end of the second quarter of  our affiliated practices also have important relationships with third party payors and managed care organizations 
we have been reviewing with these major payors and managed care organizations the status of their yk readiness 
most of our major payors are large insurance carriers and government agencies 
based on discussions with some of our affiliated practices  many of the major third party payors are either compliant or are in the testing phase at this time 
however  we also understand there are some government payors  such as medicare  that are not yet yk compliant 
any failure by one of our significant third party payors to fully address all yk issues could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we believe we are addressing all significant yk issues which could affect us  we have few alternatives available  other than reversion to manual methods  in order to avoid the effects of not establishing yk readiness 
as a result  if any significant issues arise with our corporate headquarters  our practices or third party payors  we could incur significant additional costs to correct the problem 
there can be no assurance that any remediation plan will address all the problems that may arise 
for the yk non compliance issues identified to date  the cost to upgrade or prepare for yk is not expected to have a material impact on our operating results
