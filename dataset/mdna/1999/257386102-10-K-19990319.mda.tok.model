item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for the second year in a row the company achieved record revenues  number of homes delivered  and net income 
revenues for increased to million from million for net income increased to million in from million in the company delivered a record  homes in compared to  in home sales for increased to  from  for the company ended with a record backlog of sales contracts compared with at the end of the company s market share in central ohio grew to by year end from at year end the company and the building industry in general continued to enjoy favorable economic conditions  generally stable interest rates and a particularly mild winter season during however  as evidenced by the company s increasing market share in central ohio  the company s aggressive marketing programs  large selection of desirable lots  emphasis on quality name brand components and customer satisfaction contributed to the company s record results in the company s ability to take advantage of the mild winter season allowed it to sell  construct and close an unusually large number of homes in the first half of the company experienced subcontractor and material cost increases and additional production expenses in order to meet the increase in the number of homes delivered 
these production related cost increases combined with higher customer financing costs due to a change in fha financing programs reduced the company s gross profit margin during the company increased its homes under construction inventories at december  to million from million at december  this increase in homes under construction also contributed to the production related cost increases 
during the second half of  the company was able to increase sales prices and reduce customer financing costs 
the increased sales prices are reflected in the average sales price of homes in the december  backlog 
the december  average sales price of homes in backlog increased to  from  at december  this increase is attributed to increased sales prices and the sale of larger homes and homes with more options 
the company believes that its superior land position is a key to maintaining a dominant market position in central ohio 
the difficulty and time required to obtain the required zoning for land is a major concern and is forcing the company to commit more resources to land inventories 
real estate inventories at december  increased to million from million at december   an increase of 
of the million increase  million is a result of increased land and land development inventories and million is a result of an increase in home construction inventories and building supplies 
land and land under development inventories increased as a result of increased development activity during the fourth quarter of this development activity was undertaken to ensure an adequate supply of lots for  to make lots available for the wider range of homes the company is offering  and to reduce the costs of lot development 
the company s expansion in the louisville  kentucky market proceeded according to plan 
offices were opened and staffed late in the third quarter of the company acquired several lots and committed  for lot and land purchase deposits as of december  the company incurred approximately  in start up costs which were charged to operations in company outlook the company closed with a record backlog of homes that had an aggregate sales value of million 
the sales outlook for appears favorable  but the company does not expect to repeat its all time record home sales realized in first quarter among other factors  the harsher winter conditions experienced early in prevented potential customers from visiting sales models 
the harsh weather conditions experienced in early has slowed the company s construction activities 
consequently  a number of deliveries and associated revenues that had been expected in the first half of will be delayed until later in the year 
as a result  closings and revenues in the first half of are expected to be lower than comparable periods in the company expects higher gross profit per home due to higher sales prices and a concentration of larger homes in backlog at december  to offset some of the effects of the decreased number of closings 
the company expects in time to be among the leading homebuilders in louisville  kentucky 
however  during  the company expects to close fewer than homes in this market 
the costs of developing a new vendor and subcontractor base and an initial home sales pricing strategy designed to establish market share are expected to result in lower gross profit margins on these homes than on comparable homes in central ohio 
consequently  the company projects that its louisville operations will incur a modest loss in year readiness disclosure statement the year problem exists because many computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
accordingly  such computer programs do not distinguish a year that begins with from a year that begins with 
if not corrected  these computer programs could fail or create erroneous results 
the company has developed and is in the process of implementing a plan for the identification and remediation of year issues that could affect its business 
the identification and remediation plan has five categories mission critical software  other software  information technology hardware  non information technology systems  and third party related issues 
mission critical software the company has identified four mission critical software systems homebuilding accounting and job cost  contract administration  sales management  and lumber division accounting and inventory management 
in january  the company purchased and began implementation of a jdedwards homebuilding and job cost accounting software system 
this is the primary software the company uses to run its business 
the project was completed july  and has been tested as year compliant 
in august  the company completed transition of its contract administration and sales management software systems to new software systems which have been tested as year compliant 
in september  the company began implementation of a jdedwards accounting and inventory management software system at its lumber division 
this system has been warranted to be year compliant 
the company completed implementation of this software system in february other software the company maintains and periodically updates an inventory of all other software utilized by it  such as word processing  spreadsheet  and database management 
during third quarter  the company began testing this software for year compliance 
the company expects to complete this testing and transition to year compliant software by second quarter information technology hardware the company maintains and periodically updates an inventory of all information technology hardware 
the company has identified and tested for year compliance the items that are likely to have the greatest impact on the company s ability to conduct business  such as its network server 
during fourth quarter  the company began evaluating the remainder of its information technology hardware 
the company expects to complete this testing and replace any non compliant hardware by third quarter non information technology systems the company has begun developing an inventory of all non information technology systems that are likely to have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct business  such as telephones and security systems 
the company intends to perform internal testing and has gathered third party representations as to the systems year compliance 
this process and any necessary migrations to new systems are expected to be completed by third quarter third party related issues the company has identified those vendors and subcontractors which have a material affect on the company s ability to conduct business 
the company has developed and distributed a questionnaire to be completed by all such vendors and subcontractors with respect to their own year compliance 
once the company has analyzed the questionnaire responses  it will take appropriate action to assist non compliant vendors and subcontractors to become compliant and or to transition to compliant vendors and subcontractors as soon as practical prior to the end of costs to address the year issues the company has spent approximately million on its year compliance plan through and has budgeted a total cost of million 
these costs include normal system upgrades and technology improvements that would have been implemented regardless of the year issue 
risks failure of the company or its vendors and subcontractors to adequately address the year issues in a timely manner could impede the company s ability to build and close homes and thus have a material adverse affect on the company s ability to generate revenues 
accordingly  the company intends to address all known year issues before problems materialize 
should the efforts on the part of the company  its vendors  and subcontractors fail to adequately address their relevant year issues  the worst case scenario would be an interruption of revenues of an undetermined length of time 
as indicated above  the company expects to complete its internal testing and transition to year compliant software and hardware by third quarter the company does not know at this time whether the vendors and subcontractors which are material to its business are currently year compliant and  if not  whether they will become year compliant on a timely basis 
the company has not yet begun to develop a contingency plan in the event that current non compliant vendors and subcontractors cannot become compliant on a timely basis  but it intends to develop such a plan by third quarter new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all entities recognize them as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and subsequently measure them at fair market value 
it also prescribes specific accounting principles to be applied to hedging activities and hedging transactions which are significantly different from prior accounting principles 
the company has not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation act of the statements contained in this report under the captions company outlook and year readiness disclosure statement and other provisions of this report which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve various important risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
these important factors include  without limitation  the following risks and uncertainties real or perceived adverse economic conditions  an increase in mortgage interest rates  mortgage commitments that expire prior to homes being delivered  the company s ability to install public improvements or build and close homes on a timely basis due to adverse weather conditions  delays or adverse decisions in the zoning  permitting or inspection processes  the effect of changing consumer tastes on the market acceptance for the company s products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  the effect of shortages or increases in the costs of materials  subcontractors  labor and financing  the continued availability of credit  the outcome of litigation  the impact of changes in government regulation  problems associated with the year issue  problems that could arise from expansion into the louisville  kentucky market and the other risks described in the company s securities and exchange commission filings 
seasonality and variability in quarterly results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels 
typically  closings and related revenues will increase in the second half of the year 
the company believes that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings 
the following table sets forth certain data for each of the last eight quarters sales backlog three revenues contracts closings at period end months ended in thousands in units in units in units mar

at december  the aggregate sales value of homes in backlog was million compared to million at december  the average sales value of homes in backlog at december  increased to  from  at december  the company annually incurs a substantial amount of indirect construction costs which are essentially fixed in nature 
for purposes of financial reporting  the company capitalizes these costs to real estate inventories on the basis of the ratio of estimated annual indirect costs to direct construction costs to be incurred 
thus  variations in construction activity cause fluctuations in interim and annual gross profits 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the statements of operations contained in the financial statements expressed as percentages of total revenues  as well as certain operating data year ended december  revenues cost of real estate sold gross profit selling  general and administrative settlement of litigation income from operations interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income homes sales contracts    closings    backlog at year end average sales price of homes closed during the year in thousands average sales price of homes in backlog at year end in thousands aggregate sales price of homes in backlog at year end in thousands    a home is included in sales contracts when the company s standard sales contract  which requires a deposit and generally has no contingencies other than for buyer financing and or for the sale of an existing home  is executed 
closings or deliveries represent homes for which the closing has occurred and conveyance of the deed has passed from the company to the buyer 
revenue and cost of real estate sold are recognized at the time of closing 
backlog represents homes for which the company s standard sales contract has been executed  but for which closings had not occurred as of the end of the period 
homes included in sales contracts and in backlog in the foregoing table are net of cancellations 
most cancellations occur because customers cannot qualify for financing 
while most cancellations occur prior to the start of construction  some cancellations occur during the construction process 
the cancellation rates for homes in backlog as of december   and were  and  respectively 
compared to revenues

as production volume increased  the company found it necessary to pay higher costs in order to attract quality vendors and expand the capacity of its existing subcontractors 
the company also experienced increased customer financing costs during due to a change in fha rules that caused many customers to move from fha financing to more expensive conventional financing 
during mid the company was able to increase its sales prices and somewhat offset the increased construction and financing costs

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s capital needs have depended upon sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
the company s traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing 
the company has incurred substantial indebtedness in the past and expects to incur substantial indebtedness in the future to fund its operations and its investment in land 
sources and uses of cash compared to net cash required by homebuilding operations in declined to million from million in the principal reasons for this reduction were the increase in net income to million from million and a reduction in the incremental increase in real estate inventories to million from million in increased payments during for prepaid expenses offset these reductions by million 
the increase in prepaid expenses principally reflected additional sales commissions and employee benefits paid during compared to the company invested million in property and equipment in compared to  during the most significant purchases during were for model home  office  and lumberyard improvements

the company generally does not buy unimproved land for speculation and generally limits its investment in unimproved land to an amount it expects to be able to develop and sell within the next three to five years 
at december   the company either owned or had under contract to purchase lots or land that could be developed into approximately  lots  and the company controlled through option agreements an additional  lots 
during  the company exercised options to purchase  controlled lots  including lots from brc 
option agreements expire at varying dates through june the company s decision to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land is based upon an assessment of a number of factors  including its existing land inventory at the time and its evaluation of the future demand for its homes 
during  the company sold lots and land to other builders for million 
real estate inventories at december  which includes homes under construction increased to million from million at december   an increase of million 
of this increase  million was a result of increased land and land development inventories and the remaining inventory increase was principally due to increased homes under construction 
land and land development inventories as a whole continued to grow in anticipation of continued strong home sales and to replace the record number of lots sold in land inventories held for future development declined million while land under development increased million 
developed lots and other land inventories remained stable 
land under development inventories increased as a result of increased development activity during the fourth quarter of this development activity was undertaken to ensure an adequate supply of lots for  to make lots available for the wider range of homes the company is offering  and to reduce the costs of lot development

the interest rate swap contracts mature between october  and may  and fix interest rates between and  plus a variable margin based on the company s interest coverage ratio 
the variable margin may range from to and is determined quarterly 
since the inception of the facility the variable margin has been 
as of december   the company was in compliance with facility covenants and the company had million available under its facility  after adjustment for borrowing base limitations 
borrowing availability under the facility could increase  depending on the company s utilization of the proceeds 
inflation and other cost increases the company is not always able to reflect all of its cost increases in the prices of its homes because competitive pressures and other factors require it in many cases to maintain or discount those prices 
while the company attempts to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  unanticipated additional costs may be incurred which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require the company  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  additional costs may be incurred to obtain more subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which additional costs can result in lower gross profits 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of  each  maturing on october   january  and may  these interest rate swap contracts  reflected in aggregate in the table below  commenced on october   january  and may  and fix the variable interest rate on the company s revolving credit note at  and  respectively 
the company enters into interest rate swap contracts to achieve an appropriate level of variable and fixed rate debt as approved by senior management 
interest rate swap contracts allow the company to have variable rate borrowings and to select the level of fixed rate debt for the company as a whole 
the expectation is that the resulting cost of funds is lower than that available under the variable rate borrowings 
under interest rate swap contracts  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount 
the level of fixed rate debt  after the effect of interest rate swap contracts have been considered  is maintained at approximately of total borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility
