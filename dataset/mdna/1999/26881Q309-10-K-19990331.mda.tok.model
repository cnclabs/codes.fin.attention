the company anticipates fluctuation in its quarterly results of operations due to several factors  including the timing of fees and milestone payments received from strategic partners  the formation of new strategic alliances by the company  the timing of expenditures in connection with research and development activities  the timing of product introductions and associated launch  marketing and sales activities  and the timing and extent of product acceptance for different indications and geographical areas of the world

revenues in also included million for work performed in connection with product development contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increased operating expenses resulted from higher research and development costs associated with advancing angiomark through clinical trials and the addition of personnel and resources to support research in the area of thrombus imaging and further development of the company s core technology 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increase was partially due to additional marketing activities  which included the hiring of personnel and development of marketing communication programs 
also contributing to the increase were higher legal costs related to ongoing patent activities and the hiring of additional support personnel 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the  increase was primarily due to higher average levels of invested cash during interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in interest expense was unchanged due to the timing of the note payable proceeds  which were received in december comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  included milestone payments of million received from mallinckrodt and  received from daiichi pursuant to collaboration agreements covering the company s lead product candidate  angiomark

annual revenues also include million and million of angiomark development contract revenue earned from strategic partners in and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increase resulted principally from additional costs for personnel and resources to support research in the area of thrombus imaging and the development of core technology 
higher costs associated with advancing angiomark through clinical trials also contributed to higher research and development expenses in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for higher expenses in were largely the result of the costs associated with the formation of two major strategic collaborations 
in addition  general and administrative expenses included a  non recurring expense related to the restructuring of a licensing arrangement under a liver agent development program that was terminated in partially offsetting these items were higher expenses in for ongoing patent protection activities  and the additional costs of becoming and operating as a publicly held company 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to  for the million increase was primarily due to higher average levels of invested cash during interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the period included interest on borrowings under promissory notes and bridge loans which were outstanding during the first five months of year the year issue results from computer programs and systems that were created to accept only two digit dates 
such systems may not be able to distinguish th century dates from st century dates 
this could result in miscalculations and system failures that could inhibit the company s ability to engage in normal business activities 
the company s state of readiness and risk the company is conducting both internal and external reviews to address the year issue 
internally  the company has been reviewing information technology it systems  and non it systems such as scientific instruments and other electronic devices that could be affected by this issue 
if required  the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software and systems for year modifications 
externally  the company has made initial contact with all of its significant external business partners including vendors  suppliers and strategic partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to their failures and to ascertain year compliance and risk 
if any of the company s business partners do not  or if the company itself does not  successfully deal with the year issue  the company could experience delays in its receipt of funding  materials and other resources which could adversely affect the conduct of its research and development operations 
the severity of these possible problems would depend on the nature of the problem and how quickly it could be corrected or an alternative implemented  which is unknown at this time 
although the company expects to have obtained year compliance before the year  the inability of the company or its business partners to remedy the year issue could have a significant impact on the company s business  financial position or results of operations 
the company estimates that the inventory and assessment of it systems  scientific instruments  and material third parties will be completed during the second quarter of the company expects to complete remediation efforts by the end of the second quarter of  and to complete the validation phase by the end of the third quarter of the company s costs of year remediation while management has not specifically determined the costs of its year efforts  the total cost to obtain year compliance is currently projected to be less than  such costs will include direct and indirect costs incurred through monitoring and managing the year issue 
direct costs include potential charges by third party software and hardware vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which are not enhanced 
indirect costs will principally consist of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
the company believes such costs will not have a material effect on the company s business  financial position  or results of operations 
the company s contingency plans at this time the company has not initiated the formulation of contingency plans 
the determination of the necessity for contingency plans will be made by the end of the third quarter of some risks of the year issue  however  are beyond the control of the company and its business partners 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations from inception through december  primarily with million in net proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in february  million from a follow on public offering of common stock in november  million from private sales of equity securities  million received from third parties in connection with collaboration and license arrangements  million of equipment lease financing and million in interest income 
from inception through december   the company has incurred million of costs attributable to operating activities  including million related to the research and development of technology and new product candidates  including angiomark 
the company s principal source of liquidity consists of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  the company is eligible to receive additional payments of million from daiichi upon the attainment of certain future angiomark development milestones 
daiichi is responsible for funding development of angiomark in japan 
under the company s agreement with mallinckrodt  mallinckrodt and the company generally will share equally in future development costs of angiomark up to a specified maximum amount 
during the year ended december   the company used approximately million of cash for operating activities  exclusive of license fee revenues 
the company expects that its cash needs for operations will increase significantly in future periods due to planned clinical trials and other expenses associated with the development of angiomark and new research and development programs 
the company estimates that existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will be sufficient to fund its operations through the first quarter of the company believes that it will need to raise additional funds for research  development and other expenses  through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances or otherwise  prior to commercialization of any of its product candidates 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both united states and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of the company s ongoing research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of the company s products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
because of anticipated spending to support development of angiomark and new research programs  the company does not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for any future quarterly or annual period prior to commercialization of angiomark 
the company anticipates continued investments in fixed assets  including equipment and facilities expansion to support new and continuing research and development programs 
in july  the company reached an agreement that will enable it to lease its current principal scientific facilities through december  the company also has a short term lease for a nearby office space  which expires in december but can be extended by the company for up to three years 
the company has incurred tax losses to date and therefore has not paid significant federal or state income taxes since inception 
at december   the company had loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes resulting from sales of equity securities  the company s ability to use the loss carryforwards is subject to limitations as defined in sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
the company currently estimates that the annual limitation on its use of net operating losses through may  will be approximately  pursuant to sections and of the code  the change in ownership resulting from public equity offerings in and any other future ownership changes may further limit utilization of losses and credits in any one year 
the company also is eligible for research and development tax credits that can be carried forward to offset federal taxable income 
the annual limitation and the timing of attaining profitability may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its operations
