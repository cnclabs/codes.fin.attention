the statements contained in this annual report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements that involve various important assumptions  risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause the company s actual results for fiscal year and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
these important factors include  without limitation  the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties set forth herein  as well as other assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors disclosed elsewhere in this report and in the company s press releases  shareholders reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations fiscal and fiscal consolidated net sales increased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal sales for fiscal grew mainly due to the inclusion of full year results from the acquisition of igc polycold systems inc igc polycold  which was added to the refrigeration segment in november  sales for fiscal increased because of the igc polycold acquisition and the inclusion of a full years results of igc medical advances inc igc mai  which was added to the electromagnetics segment in march  as a percentage of net sales  gross margins declined in fiscal due mainly to inventory write offs  production problems  and an unfavorable sales mix in certain business groups 
gross margins had improved in fiscal due to cost reduction efforts and a favorable product mix  including the acquisition of igc mai and igc polycold 
looking forward  the company expects greater sales and earnings in fiscal this expectation is based on the following assumptions  among others the market for mri systems continues to grow  the company can successfully contend with continued competitive pressure on selling prices in the mri marketplace for magnets and materials  anticipated sales of refrigerants occur  sales of refrigeration products to asian customers increase  reductions in production costs in the operating segments continue  including resolution of production problems at igc apd cryogenics inc igc apd  no adverse consequences of the year problem or any litigation occur  and  unconsolidated affiliate improves operating performance 
also  the company expects future sales growth due to the signing of a five year agreement with philips medical systems to be the exclusive developer and supplier of advanced superconductive magnet systems  with a total value estimated to exceed  the purchase of manufacturing rights from the company s european joint venture partner  as described below  and the signing of a  agreement to supply over four years superconducting materials for the large haldron collider which will be  when completed  the world s most powerful particle accelerator  at the european laboratory for particle physics located near geneva  switzerland 
company funded product research and development expenses decreased in fiscal by compared to an increase of in fiscal  almost all of which was due to acquisitions 
the decline in resulted from the completion of certain internal programs and the termination of the field effects division business 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared with an increase of in fiscal the modest increase in was due to the inclusion of igc polycold for a full year  offset by reductions in other refrigeration products and the termination of field effects 
the increase was due primarily to acquisitions  increased marketing expenses for igc apd  and a non cash charge of  associated with the issuance of a warrant to sumitomo corporation of america in connection with a distribution agreement 
in november  the company decided to close the field effects division after the unilateral cancellation of a marketing agreement by the exclusive distributor of the field effects permanent magnet based clinical mri system 
as a result  the company wrote off  of inventory and recorded a charge to operations of  relating to the costs associated with the expenses necessary to close out the business unit 
in fiscal the company began to separately report the amortization of intangible assets due to the significance of such expense resulting from acquisitions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired for these acquisitions and investments is being written off over years 
in fiscal the company froze all pension benefits as of december  with the exception of approximately bargaining union members at igc apd inc 
therefore  no additional benefits were accrued after that date 
since prior company contributions were intended to fund both benefits earned and those expected to be earned in the future  the freezing of the benefits generated a curtailment gain of  which has been credited to the appropriate operating expenses containing salary and wages expense 
the company has been advised that the pension plan has sufficient assets to permit termination of the plan and has begun the required steps to do so in accordance with statutory requirements 
the actual termination date depends on economic conditions and receiving regulatory approval and may require the company to recognize additional pension expense to provide full funding of vested benefits upon termination 
interest expense was slightly higher in fiscal due to utilization of short term borrowings  and in principally due to the issuance of a short term note as part of the igc polycold acquisition 
during the company s fiscal year  smis experienced cash flow problems and continued operating losses as a result of its inability to achieve the anticipated improvements in its business plan  including new product orders  improved manufacturing results and cost reductions 
in march   it was determined by smis management that additional funds would be required to sustain operations based on projected cash flows and the deterioration in its backlog 
based on the company s evaluation of smis past performance and projections for future results it was determined by intermagnetics management in the fourth quarter of fiscal that it would not provide additional funding to smis 
subsequent to the close of the company s fiscal year  smis agreed in principle to sell the majority of its business at a price that will not result in any return to its shareholders 
accordingly  the company recorded a impairment charge of million to write off its investment in and advances to smis  consisting of ordinary and redeemable preference shares in the amount of  and notes receivable in the amount of  and to provide for the estimated million that will be required to settle third party debt of smis guaranteed by the company 
in fiscal the company incurred a net loss and recognized a tax benefit of  relating to the portion of the loss which can be reflected on income tax returns 
during fiscal year  the company recognized approximately  of capital losses for income tax purposes  including approximately  in connection with the write off of smis 
under current tax law  only  can be carried back against previously recognized capital gains 
the company s effective income tax rate increased in fiscal to  up from in fiscal  due mainly to the effect of non deductible amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions 
see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for detailed information regarding income taxes 
in may   the company entered into a distributorship agreement with sumitomo corporation of america to market fr refrigerant in the asia pacific market 
in june   the company entered into a warrant agreement with sumitomo under which sumitomo could purchase up to  shares of common stock 
sumitomo paid  for the rights to the warrants 
the company issued an initial warrant to purchase  shares at per share 
in connection with the initial warrant  the company incurred a non cash charge of  in fiscal the warrant expired unexercised in november in december   pennzoil products company announced that it was merging with quaker state and  as a consequence  was discontinuing the distribution of frigc refrigerants to concentrate on its core businesses 
pennzoil turned over to the company their frigc related mobile air conditioning refrigerant business and the company repurchased pennzoil s frigc refrigerant inventory 
the company is servicing the former pennzoil customers through direct sales and wholesale distributors 
segment discussion electromagnetics segment 
this segment consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of superconductive magnets  rf coils  and other magnetic products 
sales for the segment decreased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal the decrease was due decreased sales by igc mbg and decreased sales as a result of the closing of the field effects division  offset by increased sales from igc mai 
the increase was principally due to the inclusion of igc mai for the full year 
magnet system sales decreased by in fiscal compared to an decrease of in fiscal  whereas rf coil sales increased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal sales is due to the inclusion of igc mai s full year results 
in fiscal  gross profit margins declined for electromagnetic products  principally because of the write off of the field effects division and an unfavorable sales mix 
in fiscal  gross profit margins increased for electromagnetic products due to continued cost improvements  higher sales and improved product mix  including igc mai s impact on the full year 
operating profit increased in this segment during the past two years  mainly due to the acquisition of igc mai 
the fiscal results were adversely affected by the termination of the field effects division 
superconducting materials segment 
this segment consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of superconducting wire and cable 
superconducting material sales increased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal  these increases were principally due to substantially higher superconducting material sales to a major customer who had previously decided not to renew a long term supply agreement 
gross margins in this segment increased in fiscal and fiscal due mainly to increased sales 
operating profit has increased for the past two years due to increased sales and improved cost controls 
refrigeration segment 
this segment  which consists of the design  development  manufacture and sale of refrigeration equipment and refrigerants  had increased sales of in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to the inclusion of igc polycold for a full year  which more than offset the decline in sales for igc apd 
fiscal includes igc polycold s sales for six months  which slightly exceeded the reduction in sales of frigc refrigerants and igc apd s refrigeration equipment due to reduced demand for both product lines 
gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  declined substantially in fiscal after having increased slightly in fiscal the fiscal decline was due to production problems  manufacturing variances  inventory write offs  and lower sales for cryogenic refrigeration equipment  principally in the igc apd business 
this segment has experienced operating losses during the past two years  despite the acquisition of igc polycold 
in fiscal  this segment experienced significant inventory write downs together with continuing higher than normal warranty expenses 
in fiscal this segment recorded a  non cash charge to operations for the issuance of a warrant

year compliance the transition to the year could potentially affect any computer system or software application that uses date data 
the year problem sometimes called the year bug or millennium bug refers to the fact that some computer systems store the year portion of dates in two digit form identifying as  for example 
state of readiness the company recognizes the importance of providing customers with products that will continue to function correctly during the year and beyond 
we continue to assess the potential impact of the year on our internal business systems  products  and operations 
our year initiatives include testing and upgrading significant information technology systems and facilities  testing and developing upgrades  contacting key vendors to determine their year compliance status  and developing contingency plans 
the company has developed and is implementing a remediation plan to identify and  if necessary  correct potential year problems in the following areas products 
the company has implemented a compliance program to test and evaluate the year readiness of the material products that it currently manufactures and sells 
the company has determined that all material products superconducting magnets  radio frequency imaging coils  superconducting wire and cable  cryogenic equipment  and refrigeration systems are year compliant 
however  as many of the company s products are complex  interact with or incorporate third party products  and operate on computer systems that are not under the company s control  there can be no assurance that the company has identified all of the year problems with its current products 
computer systems 
the company has completed the evaluation of all desktop and server systems for the existence of year problems using commercial evaluation software 
the majority of our non compliant desktop and server systems have been replaced or upgraded to become year compliant 
the small number of remaining non compliant desktop and server systems will be corrected and tested before the end of october  business software 
the company s assessment and remediation plan has identified that several of the present business systems are not year compliant 
the company has had an ongoing project to install an enterprise wide resource planning system designed to integrate all business entities 
this project began in the software and hardware selected for this project is year compliant and is expected to be implemented by the end of october  this represents a five month delay from the originally expected implementation date of may  one of our business units has rendered its existing business system year compliant and will be implementing the corporate wide enterprise resource planning system in fiscal non information technology systems 
non information technology systems include facilities and communications systems such as hvac  telephone  voice mail  and security systems  as well as machine tools and controls used in the manufacturing process 
the company has completed its evaluation of these systems and has developed replacement or upgrade plans to correct the problems incurred 
non compliant phone and voice mail systems at two of our locations will be replaced by the end of october business partners 
the company is in the process of identifying and assessing the year readiness of key vendors that are believed to be significant to the company s business operations 
beginning in  the company requested year readiness information from all its vendors 
the company is now in the process of performing year risk assessments for all critical suppliers 
for our most critical vendors  contingency plans have been developed  and in some cases implemented  to mitigate year risks 
the company believes that its major customers have substantially mitigated their year risks 
costs the company estimates that the total cost of its assessment and remediation plan will amount to approximately million  which is being funded through operating cash flows 
included in this amount is approximately million for the replacement of the business systems described above  which is being capitalized because its purchase and implementation was primarily related to increases in system functionality 
approximately million of the expected total cost has been expended as of july  contingency plans the company is performing year risk assessments for all its critical suppliers to ensure the uninterrupted flow of good and services into the year as part of risk mitigation  the company is developing contingency plans that will allow its primary business operations to continue despite disruptions due to year problems 
these plans include identifying and securing alternate suppliers  increasing inventories  and modifying production facilities and schedules 
the company expects to complete the year risk assessment of all critical suppliers and to implement contingency plans  where deemed appropriate  by the end of september risks of the company s year issues while the company is attempting to minimize any negative consequences arising from the year issue  there can be no assurance that year problems will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations  or financial condition 
while the company expects that upgrades to its internal business systems will be completed in a timely fashion  there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter unexpected costs or delays 
despite its efforts to ensure that its material current products are year compliant  the company may see an increase in warranty and other claims  especially those related to company products that incorporate  or operate using  third party software or hardware 
if any of the company s significant vendors experience business disruptions due to year issues  there may also be a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur material costs in defending or bringing lawsuits related to year issues 
in addition  if any year issues are identified  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain qualified personnel to remedy such issues 
any unexpected costs or delays arising from the year issue could have a significant adverse impact on the company s business  operations  and financial condition in amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated at this time

on november   the company acquired igc polycold of san rafael  ca  a manufacturer of low temperature refrigeration systems including water vapor cryopumps  cryocoolers  cold trap chillers and gas chillers  for an aggregate consideration of approximately  consisting of a day promissory note for  paid in march   shares of the company s common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock  which is redeemable in cash or common stock at the option of the company 
the  excess of purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired is being amortized over years 
the preferred stock is redeemable in cash by the company at any time at per share 
also  the company may convert some or all of the preferred stock into common stock at any time after december   but before december  if any of the preferred stock is not so converted by the company  it shall automatically convert into common stock as of december  the conversion shall be effected by dividing the conversion price per share by the average of the closing prices of the common stock on the ten trading days preceding the date of conversion 
in fiscal  the company entered into an agreement to purchase  from its european joint venture partner  all of the manufacturing rights and licenses  as well as certain other assets of the joint venture  for a total consideration of  the joint venture will cease operating about the beginning of the year when increased shipments will begin from the company s latham  ny factory 
in fiscal  the company made an initial payment of  of the purchase price with the balance scheduled for payment in march  it is expected that this transaction will result in up to a increase in the company s mri magnet shipments  as well as a similar increase in the manufacture of superconducting wire by igc advanced superconductors beginning in mid it is not expected that these increased production rates will require substantial investments in additional capital equipment 
during fiscal  under the company s stock buy back program  the company repurchased a total of  shares of common stock for  also in fiscal  the company paid  for the early retirement of  convertible subordinated debentures due september and recorded a pre tax gain of  which is included in interest and other income 
during the year ended may   smis obtained line of credit financing in the amount of  pounds  as of may  the company has guaranteed by issuing a letter of credit repayment of one half of the outstanding balance  up to  pounds  approximately  as of may  in the event of default by smis 
the company has included the expected cost of honoring this guarantee in the amount written off restricted with the impairment loss recorded on investment in and advanced to smis 
in september  the company acquired  shares of the series a preferred stock  of powercold corporation  a publicly held corporation powercold for approximately  powercold has strong ties with the supermarket refrigeration industry and is a solution provider of energy efficient products for refrigeration  air conditioning and power industries 
the series a preferred stock is convertible by the company at any time until september  when it will automatically be converted into shares of powercold common stock 
the conversion price subject to adjustments will be based on a percentage of the thirty day average closing bid price for the powercold common stock on the otc bulletin board prior to conversion or  if lower  prior to september  see the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this report  for a detailed description of the sources and uses of cash during fiscal as well as the two preceding years 
the company s capital resource commitments as of august  consisted principally of capital equipment commitments of approximately  approximately  for the smis loan guarantee and the balance due on the purchase of rights from the european joint venture 
the company has an unsecured line of credit of  which expires in november  of which  was in use at may  and none at may  the company may elect to apply interest rates to borrowings under the line which relate to either the london interbank offered rate libor or prime  whichever is the most favorable 
the weighted average interest rate with respect to borrowings at may  was 
the line of credit agreement provides for various covenants  including requirements that the company maintain specified financial ratios 
the company was not in compliance with its minimum tangible net worth and interest coverage ratios for the fiscal year ended may  the company has received a waiver dated august  from the financial institutions related specifically to these events of default as of may  and a commitment from the financial institutions to amend the aforementioned financial ratios 
the company has issued letters of credit in the aggregate amount of  pounds approximately  at may  in support of guarantees of indebtedness for smis and the performance of a contract 
the company believes that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its needs for the short term by using internally generated funds and existing credit facilities 
however  on a longer term basis with substantial increases in sales volume and or unusually large expenditure requirements to commercialize the frigc family of refrigerants or high temperature superconducting materials and devices  the company may be required to obtain additional lines of credit for working capital purposes and possibly make periodic public offerings or private placements in order to meet the liquidity needs of such growth 
while the company does not believe it will be restricted in financing such growth  there can be no assurances that such sources of financing will be available to the company in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
under such circumstances  the company would expect to manage its growth within the financing available
