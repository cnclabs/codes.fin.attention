funds were used primarily to repay fhlb advances totaling million  to fund purchases of investment securities available for sale totaling million  and to originate loans held for sale of million 
savings institutions  such as the bank  are required to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets equal to a certain percentage of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable deposit accounts and borrowings payable in one year or less 
the liquidity requirements may vary from time to time between and depending upon economic conditions and savings flows of all savings institutions 
at the present time  the required liquid asset ratio is

the company s liquidity could be impacted by a decrease in the renewals of deposits or general deposit runoff 
however  the company has the ability to raise deposits by conducting deposit promotions 
in the event the company requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  the company could obtain additional advances from the fhlb 
the company could also obtain funds through the sale of investment securities from its available for sale portfolio 
market risk management the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of interest income and interest expense and the market value of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the primary goal of the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize its net interest income over time while keeping interest rate risk exposure within levels established by the company s management 
the company s ability to manage its interest rate risk depends generally on the company s ability to match the maturities and repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities while taking into account the separate goals of maintaining asset quality and liquidity and achieving the desired level of net interest income 
the principal variables that affect the company s management of its interest rate risk include the company s existing interest rate gap position  management s assessment of future interest rates  the need for the company to replace assets that may prepay before their scheduled maturities  and the withdrawal of liabilities over time 
one technique used by the company in managing its interest rate risk exposure is the management of the company s interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
at december   the company s one year positive gap interest earning assets maturing within a period exceed interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period was approximately million  or of total assets 
thus  during periods of rising interest rates  this implies that the company s net interest income would be positively affected because the yield of the company s interest earning assets is likely to rise more quickly than the cost on its interest bearing liabilities 
in periods of falling interest rates  the opposite effect on net interest income is likely to occur 
the interest sensitivity gap position of the company is a static analysis at december  because many factors affect the composition of the company s assets and liabilities  a change in prevailing interest rates will not necessarily result in the corresponding change in net interest income that would be projected using only the interest sensitivity gap table for the company at december  at december   the company s one year positive gap was approximately million  or of total assets 
the increase in the one year positive gap of approximately million was primarily the result of a faster prepayment assumptions in regarding prepayment of loans which has resulted in an increase in one year interest sensitive loans of million  b a decrease in mortgage backed securities with one year interest sensitivity of million due primarily to sales  maturities and principal repayments  c a decrease of million of one year interest sensitive deposits due primarily to a decrease in the outstanding balances of certificates of deposit and  d a decrease of million in one year interest sensitive advances from the federal home loan bank as proceeds from mortgage backed certificates were used to pay down advances 
the company manages its interest rate risk by influencing the adjustable and fixed rate mix of its loans  securities  deposits and borrowings 
the company can add loans or securities with adjustable  balloon or call features  as well as fixed rate loans and mortgage securities if the yield on such loans and securities is consistent with the company s asset liability management strategy 
also  the company can manage its interest rate risk by extending the maturity of its borrowings or selling certain assets and repaying borrowings 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any method of analysis used to estimate a financial institution s interest rate gap 
the analysis is based at a given point in time and does not take into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities also may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
the interest rates on loans with balloon or call features may or may not change depending upon their interest rates relative to market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features that may restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
the company is also subject to prepayment risk  particularly in falling interest rate environments or in environments where the slope of the yield curve is relatively flat or negative 
such changes in the interest rate environment can cause substantial changes in the level of prepayments of loans and mortgage backed certificates  which may also affect the company s interest rate gap position 
as part of its borrowings  the company may utilize from time to time  convertible advances from the fhlb atlanta 
convertible advances generally provide for a fixed rate of interest for a portion of the term of the advance  an ability for the fhlb atlanta to convert the advance from a fixed rate to an adjustable rate at some predetermined time during the remaining term of the advance the conversion feature  and a concurrent opportunity for the company to prepay the advance with no prepayment penalty in the event the fhlb atlanta elects to exercise the conversion feature 
changes in interest rates from those at december  may result in a change in the estimated maturity of convertible advances and  therefore  the company s interest rate gap position 
also  the methodology used estimates various rates of withdrawal or decay for money market deposit  savings  and checking accounts  which may vary significantly from actual experience 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are subject to repricing or that mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the table reflects certain assumptions regarding prepayment of loans and mortgage backed certificates that are outside of actual contractual terms  and are based on the prepayment experience of the company 
additionally  loans and securities with call or balloon provisions are included in the period in which they balloon or may first be called

the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december   based on the information and assumptions set forth in the notes to the table 
totals as of december  are included for comparative purposes 
the company had no derivative financial instruments  foreign currency exposure or trading portfolio as of december  and the amounts included under each expected maturity date for loans  mortgage backed certificates  and other investments were calculated by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes to the table 
similarly  expected maturity date amounts for interest bearing core deposits were calculated based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding as set forth in the notes 
with respect to the company s adjustable rate instruments  amounts included under each expected maturity date were measured by adjusting the instrument s contractual maturity date for expectations of prepayments  as set forth in the notes 
interest earning assets maturing in one year increased and those maturing after five years decreased at december  due primarily to an increase in the loan prepayment rate assumptions at december  these prepayment rates increased as a result of lower interest rates which also contributed to the overall decreases in yields on average interest earning assets between december  and interest bearing liabilities maturing in one year decreased at december  primarily as a result of the reduction in interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings which resulted primarily from increases in noninterest bearing deposits and the sale of mortgage backed certificates 
interest bearing liabilities maturing in years three and four changed primarily from the assumption that federal home loan bank convertible advances were estimated to mature in year four at december  instead of year three at december  a lower cost mix of interest bearing liabilities contributed to the decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities at december  compared to those paid at december  amount maturing in there fair dollars in thousands year years years years years after total value interest earning assets loans fixed rate         average interest rate adjustable rate         average interest rate mortgage backed certificates fixed rate    average interest rate adjustable rate      average interest rate investments        average interest rate federal funds sold    average interest rate total december          average interest rate total december          average interest rate interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits         average interest rate borrowings     average interest rate total december          average interest rate total december          average interest rate assumes the following annual prepayment rates for single family residential adjustable loans which adjust based upon changes in the one year constant maturity treasury index   for single family fixed rate first mortgage loans  from to  for commercial real estate loans  an average of  for consumer loans  an average of  and for most other loans  from to

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  this statement is not currently applicable to the company  because the company does not have any derivative instruments and is not involved in hedging activities 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  such computer programs will not recognize the correct date after december  also  systems and equipment that are not typically thought of as computer related referred to as non it contain imbedded hardware or software that may have a time element 
in  the company implemented a four phase project of inventory  assessment  renovation and testing implementation to address the year issue 
the scope of the project includes ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on the mainframe  pc and lan systems  addressing issues related to non it embedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance of the company s significant borrowers and third party providers 
a summary of significant milestones is presented below the first three phases of inventory  assessment and renovation have been substantially completed 
the final phase  testing and implementation  is in process and is expected to be substantially completed by march  the company plans to conduct additional testing throughout the year 
the majority of the company s non it related systems and equipment are currently year compliant based primarily on communications with vendors 
compilation of written documentation regarding compliance is underway and is scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of  as is any testing of critical systems that the company determines needs to be conducted 
the potential impact of year will depend not only on the corrective measures the company undertakes but also on other entities who provide data to or receive data from the company and on those whose operational capability or financial conditions are important to the company 
the company has received assurances from all major third party vendors that they are either year compliant or expect to be in compliance prior to the end of the second quarter of in addition  management has reviewed significant lending and deposit relationships and consulted with these customers as to their plans to address year issues 
the plans of such parties are currently being monitored  and any fundamental impact on the company will be evaluated 
the company has established an internal review process to evaluate its year testing results 
monthly progress reports are made to the company s senior management and board of directors 
the company estimates  based on current projections of allocations of existing resources and known direct costs  that total costs related to the year project will be approximately  the company estimates that approximately of these costs will be related to the redeployment of existing personnel to address year issues  while approximately of these costs will represent incremental expenses to the company since inception of the year project 
since inception  the company has incurred approximately  of costs related to its year project  of which approximately  represents incremental expenses 
of the  of year project costs incurred since inception  approximately  and approximately  were incurred in and  respectively 
some computer related initiatives have been delayed due to the allocation of resources towards year issues 
management believes there has not been an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or day to day operations as a result of computer projects being deferred due to reallocation of resources to the year project 
the company has established a customer awareness program to inform customers of year issues and provide status reports as to the bank s year efforts 
the company expects its critical systems to be compliant well before december  in the unlikely event that a critical system should not perform as expected or if there is non compliance by a major third party provider  the company is developing a contingency plan to address the possible failure of critical systems 
the company expects to complete its contingency plan by the end of the second quarter of safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of information contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other than historical information  may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  the company s interest rate risk position  and future credit and economic trends including inflation and changing prices and the company s compliance with year data processing standards
