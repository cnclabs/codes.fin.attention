funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  and other non recurring items  plus depreciation amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry 
depreciation amortization of assets not unique to the industry  such as amortization of deferred financing costs and non real estate assets  is not added back 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
the company considers ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of the company s presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits

year in  the company began a comprehensive review of its year compliance issues utilizing an overlapping  three phased approach 
phase i involves assessments of building infrastructure and internal computer systems including both hardware and software to identify possible compliance failures 
phase ii involves vendor compliance and actual testing of hardware and software applications including significant electronic interfaces 
phase iii involves identifying remaining company wide risks and development of contingency plans 
the company expects to complete phases i and ii of its year review in mid phase iii is expected to run from march through december based on the review plan as well as the expected success of remediation efforts currently underway  management believes the company has no material risks related to the ability of its hardware and software to recognize the year and beyond as valid dates 
the company s primary financial and operational software programs are purchased from outside vendors who have already resolved year issues 
the company has received letters from these vendors indicating that their software is year compliant 
the company is in the process of replacing one computer system  however  which is not currently year compliant at an estimated cost of approximately million 
the new system was implemented in january and is expected to be fully operational in early the related cost will be depreciated over its estimated useful life 
as part of phase ii  the company has initiated steps to identify and contact key vendors whose inability to provide service in the year could have a material adverse effect on the company s business operations 
with the exception of utility services  the company believes that there are no other critical suppliers whose inability to provide service would materially affect business operations 
this is due primarily to the physical nature of the company s product as well as the availability of multiple suppliers of property services 
the company does not have a contingency plan to address the possibility that utility services may not be available 
however  management believes that this is a very unlikely scenario 
readers are cautioned that these conclusions involve numerous subjective assumptions and there can be no assurances that management has adequately identified or addressed all possible contingencies 
excluding the replacement system  the company s year compliance efforts have been primarily conducted with internal staff 
accordingly  the costs have been immaterial and are expensed as incurred
