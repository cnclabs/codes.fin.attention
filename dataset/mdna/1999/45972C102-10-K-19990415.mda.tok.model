the company is continuing to negotiate potential financing options including long term mortgage financing for its facilities 
the company s future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including commencing production of radioisotopes  possible delays in the final regulatory approval process for its radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility and the linac  expenses in developing the proposed medical imaging camera  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  technological and market developments  and the ability of the company to maintain collaborative academic and commercial research  development and marketing relationships 
the company has incurred losses from operations since inception and has an accumulated deficit of  as of december  the company s history of operating losses has resulted in continued dependence upon additional external financing 
management s plans regarding its liquidity involve the successful execution of its business plan  including the successful commercialization of the company s products 
the company intends to obtain additional capital necessary to fund operations  complete the installation of the linac  and meet debt service requirements  from public and private sales of equity or debt securities 
the company anticipates  based on the execution of its business plan and its continued capital raising activities  that it will have sufficient funds to finance its operating activities for at least the next twelve months 
in the event the company is unable to secure sufficient funds  the company s operations and business expansion would be significantly curtailed 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing or obtain financing on terms acceptable to the company 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
impact of year the year will have a broad impact on the business environment in which the company operates due to the possibility that many computerized systems across all industries will be unable to process information containing dates beginning in the year the company has established an enterprise wide program to assess the extent of the company s exposure to year issues and to formulate and execute a plan to effectively mitigate the effects of the year problem on the company s operations 
the company has established an executive steering committee to provide oversight to the implementation of the year program and is responsible for reviewing and approving the plans  activities  and decisions associated with identifying and mitigating the risk associated with the year problem 
the committee also reviews budgetary information  provides guidelines and acts as a liaison to the board of directors  which has the ultimate responsibility for the budget and mitigation of the year problem 
responsibilities for implementing the plan have been assigned and the company has identified critical equipment and software for the following operational areas o linac identified critical equipment and software in the linac includes the oscilloscopes  modulators  lab view time date system  daq hardware  gpib hardware and autocad software 
vendor assurance letters of the year compliance have been obtained on these components and internal validation is being done 
o cyclotron list of critical equipment in the cyclotron is still being prepared 
vendor assurance letters have been obtained on the critical equipment identified and will be obtained on future identified critical equipment 
internal validation should be completed by june  o radiopharmacy identified critical equipment within the radiopharmacy includes thermal transfer printer  gamma spectroscopy system  sodium iodine scintillator detector system istrument software ionization chamber and dose calibrators 
vendor assurance letters have been received on all but the instrumentation software  which is pending as of march  internal validation is planned for the second quarter of o computer equipment and software all computer equipment and software is identified as critical equipment 
inventories of all systems hardware and software have been completed 
software inventory reporting software has been installed on each computer  which monitors installed software on each computer 
vendor assurance letters of year compliance have been obtained for all software owned by the company 
we will be installing clicknet yk software on all computers during the second quarter to maintain year compliance 
o utility equipment systems identified critical equipment for the utilities systems include series controllers  pumps and controllers  hvac  and wfi chillers 
vendor assurance letters of year compliance have been received for each of these components and internal validation has been performed 
the company is performing year compliance testing on new equipment and components as they are being put into place 
as of march   year testing has resulted in no significant remediations required 
in addition to the assesement of in house systems  the company is currently assessing the readiness of its vendors for the year issue 
the company has commenced inquiries of key vendors regarding the status or the respective year compliance procedures  and in certain cases  certifications regarding year compliance have been obtained 
by the second quarter  the company intends to have developed contingency plans in the event key vendors have not provided the company with satisfactory evidence of their readiness to handle year issues 
the company intends to make every reasonable effort to assess the readiness of its key vendors and to create action plans to address any identified risks 
the company has estimated the total cost of the year remediation including modification  upgrade  or replacement of systems and equipment to be approximately  the company expects to identify and resolve all year issues that could materially and adversely affect its business operations by june  although the company has estimated the total cost of the remediation efforts to be about  any unanticipated failures by key vendors  as well as failures by the company to execute its own remediation efforts  could have a material adverse effect on the cost of the year project and its completion date 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to variable rate loans that are benchmarked to us bank prime lending rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage overall borrowing costs or reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
the impact on the company s results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of the variable rate debt as of december  would be immaterial
