during  management expects that the communities will benefit further from improvements completed in and plans to continue to fund similar non recurring  revenue enhancing upgrades in addition to normal capital replacements 
impact of the year on system processing the year yk problem concerns the inability of information systems to properly recognize and process date sensitive information beyond january  as a result  the yk problem can affect any system that uses date data  including mainframes  pcs  and embedded microprocessors that control security systems  call processing systems  building climate systems  elevators  office equipment and even fire alarms 
all references to percent complete below are as of the company s state of readiness the company began addressing the yk issue in september as such it divided its review into two segments business critical and mission critical systems 
business critical systems are those with the potential to affect the financial and operational infrastructure of the company 
mission critical are those systems with a potential to affect the delivery of electricity and natural gas to our residents  commercial tenants and employees and the safety of residents  commercial tenants and employees 
recognizing that the mission critical systems rely heavily on public service vendors  the company s focus to date has been on business critical systems under the assumption that market forces and regulatory agencies would encourage and monitor the compliance of the telecommunications  utilities and emergency service industries 
the company has set up systems to monitor the progress of mission critical service providers and will develop contingency plans  possibly in coordination with industry organizations  as needed  to minimize the possibility that the yk problem would disrupt the lives of its residents  commercial tenants and employees 
the company relies exclusively on micro computers pc s 
pc s exist in the corporate office  regional offices and at the communities 
the company is complete with its review and modification of corporate office systems towards yk compliance 
outstanding projects include upgrading the voicemail system and installing yk compliant modules of non critical property management software 
specifically  the software vendors have advised the company that the property management  accounts payable and general ledger software and payroll software is compliant 
the company will continue a dialog with all software service providers so that any additional upgrades can be completed as necessary 
the company is complete with its review and modification of regional office systems and complete with its review and modification of community based systems 
the company has one and one half full time employees dedicated to upgrading regional offices and community based systems 
additional information systems employees will assist as needed 
employee participation in this effort is slightly greater than originally anticipated resulting in additions to our dedicated staff 
the company anticipates its regional office systems will be tested for compliance by july and that its community based systems will be tested for compliance by september both of the testing targets have been extended in recognition of the company s need for more resources than originally anticipated 
once all hardware and software components are believed to be yk ready  the company plans to periodically match its systems inventory against hardware and software component manufacturer upgrade releases to assure that its systems have the most current yk upgrades including any properties acquired 
the ability of the company to successfully transact monetary exchanges is key to continued successful operation 
for this reason  all financial institutions which the company has a relationship will be identified and queried for yk readiness status during the second quarter of this evaluation has been delayed as it was felt that a delay would result in a more accurate picture of the bank s status 
the company s significant relationships are with regional and national financial institutions which are also subject to the oversight of various federal regulatory agencies for their yk compliance 
delivery of goods and services ie  building and elevator access  security systems  hvac  life safety  etc 
to the company s communities and offices must continue to be provided without interruption 
the company expects to have surveyed all critical suppliers by june to determine their yk readiness status 
contingency plans testing will begin in august to determine the company s business critical system readiness 
based on testing results  contingency plans may be put in place 
this target date has been changed as management is more comfortable that the time required to develop contingency plans will be less than originally planned 
risks since the company s major source of income is rental payments under term leases at communities located in different municipalities  the failure of business critical systems at any one community is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
given the complexity and general uncertainty of the yk issues in the gas  electric  telecommunications  banking and related industries  even the most comprehensive program  however  cannot assure that unforeseen problems will not occur 
the company therefore is unable at this time to determine whether any unforeseen impacts could have a material effect on the company s financial condition 
the company believes that upon the full implementation of our upgraded business system and assuming yk compliance of our public service vendors  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should not be material 
costs the total cost of the company s yk activities  which is estimated at  is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position 
approximately  has been expended as of march  the remaining expenditures to be incurred will be funded from operations 
a majority of these costs are an acceleration of the amounts the company would anticipate incurring to upgrade business systems  regardless of the yk problem  considering the evolution of technology and the requirements for running newly acquired and improved system applications 
environmental issues phase i environmental audits have been completed on substantially all of the owned properties 
there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities as there are no known contingencies with respect thereto 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a liability for site restoration or other costs that may be incurred with respect to the sale or disposal of a property 
recent accounting pronouncements the company is not aware of any pronouncements which would have a material impact 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which enables the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
these short term leases minimize the potential adverse effect of inflation on rental income  although residents may leave without penalty at the end of their lease terms and may do so if rents are increased significantly
