item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations has been the principal source of capital to fund the company s ongoing operations 
the company s issuance of common and preferred stock  use of the company s revolving credit facilities and financing from unsecured notes and mortgage debt have been the principal sources of capital required to fund its growth 
in order to continue to expand and develop its portfolio of properties and other investments  the company intends to finance future acquisitions and growth through the most advantageous sources of capital available to the company at the time  which may include the sale of common stock  preferred stock or debt securities through public offerings or private placements  the incurrence of additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings  and the reinvestment of proceeds from the disposition of assets 
the company also may enter into joint ventures with institutions to acquire large properties 
in these instances  the company generally receives property management and leasing fees in addition to a disproportionate share of the profits after a preferred return is received by the institutional partner 
the company s financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by i maintaining a prudent level of leverage  ii maintaining a large pool of unencumbered properties  iii managing its exposure to interest rate risk represented by its floating rate debt  iv where possible  amortizing existing non recourse mortgage debt secured by specific properties over the term of the leases with anchor tenants at such mortgaged properties  and v maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio 
the company has a revolving credit facility of million in unsecured advances from a group of banks 
the facility expires in december and bears an interest rate of basis points over libor 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under this facility 
the covenants of the credit facility include maintaining certain ratios such as liabilities to assets of less than and maintaining a minimum interest coverage of to the company also has an unsecured revolving credit facility of million through november  all of which was outstanding as of december  in addition to outstanding amounts on the company s credit facilities  debt as of december  consisted of million of mortgages payable having a weighted average interest rate of and million of notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 
of this debt  million bear variable interest rates 
additionally  the company has million in marketable equity securities which are sensitive to market price changes and notes receivable in the amount of approximately canadian million approximately us million as of december  which are sensitive to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in november  the company filed a billion shelf registration statement 
this registration statement was filed for the purpose of issuing debt securities  preferred stock  depository shares  common stock  warrants or rights 
currently  no securities have been issued under this shelf registration statement 
on february   the company established a program for the sale of up to million aggregate principal amount of medium term notes due nine months or more from date of issue 
the trust will guarantee any medium term notes issued by the company in the future under this program under this shelf registration statement 
other sources of funds are available to the company 
based on management s internal valuation of the company s properties  many of which are free and clear of mortgages  the estimated value is considerably in excess of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness 
accordingly  management believes that potential exists for additional mortgage financing as well as unsecured borrowing capacity from banks and other lenders 
the company has three classes of preferred stock outstanding as of december  i  shares of series a cumulative convertible preferred stock outstanding which have an annual distribution of per share payable quarterly  ii  depositary shares outstanding  each representing of a share of series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock  with an annual distribution of per depositary share payable quarterly  and iii  depositary shares outstanding  each representing of one share of series d cumulative voting step up premium rate preferred stock  with a liquidation preference and annual distribution of and per depositary share  respectively 
the current quarterly dividend on the company s common stock is 
per share 
the company anticipates that the quarterly dividend will increase at least 
per share per quarter which quarterly increases amount to 
per share on an annualized basis and effectively increase the annualized dividend rate by 
per share for each share held over a month period until the annualized quarterly dividend on the company s common stock is at least per share 
the maintenance of this dividend policy will be subject to various factors  including the discretion of the board of directors of the company  the ability to pay dividends under applicable law and the effect which the payment of dividends may have from time to time on the maintenance by the company of its status as a reit 
in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either non financial or non qualitative 
such risks principally include credit risks and legal risks and are not included in the aforementioned notes 
year compliance year compliance readiness the company s centralized corporate business and technical information systems have been assessed as to year compliance and functionality 
year compliance issues with respect to the company s internal business and technical information systems were substantially remediated as of december  see year compliance detail below 
in addition  the company has completed the identification and review of major computer hardware and software suppliers and has verified the year preparedness of these suppliers 
year compliance detail the company addressed the year issue with respect to the following i the company s information technology and operating systems  including its billing  accounting and financial reporting systems  ii the company s non information technology systems  including building access  parking lot light and energy management  equipment and other infrastructure systems that may contain or use computer systems or embedded micro controller technology  and iii certain systems of the company s major suppliers and material service providers insofar as such systems relate to the company s business activities such as payroll  health services and alarm systems 
as described below  the company s year review involves a an assessment of the year problems that may affect the company  b the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase to the extent practical or feasible  c the testing of such remedies and d the preparation of contingency plans to deal with worst case scenarios 
assessment phase as part of the internal assessment phase  the company has attempted to substantially identify all the major components of the systems described above 
in determining the extent to which such systems are vulnerable to the year issue  the company is evaluating internally developed and or purchased software applications and property operational control systems eg  heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac  lighting timers  alarms  fire  sewage and access 
in addition  in october  the company began sending letters to or making inquiries of certain of its major suppliers and service providers  requesting them to provide the company with assurance of existing or anticipated year compliance by their systems insofar as the systems relate to their activities with the company 
the company expects that it will complete its distribution of these inquiries by april  the company is requesting that all responses to the inquiries be returned to it no later than may  remediation and testing phase based upon the assessment and remediation efforts to date  the company has completed  tested and put on line the year compliance modification in all the internally developed software for its accounting and property management applications 
the company s computer terminals or personal computers are year compliant in all material respects 
the company has secured software to upgrade that part of the computer that will make it compliant 
that part is called the bios chip or basic input output system 
if there is any unforeseen problem with a particular unit it will be replaced 
replacements are readily available 
based on an inventory by model type of the company s personal computers  bios chip year issues are not expected to be material 
a conservative  worst case scenario is included in the cost estimate 
the versions of the purchased software that the company uses for spread sheet analysis  database applications  word processing systems and its apartment rent collection system have been tested and are compliant 
the outsourced payroll service and the integrated internal input system are compliant 
the new york and san diego corporate office phone  communication and data collection networks are year compliant  however  based on the expanded needs of the company  replacement of the phone system including the voicemail system is scheduled to occur by june  phone systems at other than corporate office locations are year compliant 
phone systems at the apartment communities are year compliant 
the balance of the phone systems at the apartment communities are scheduled to be reviewed and be year compliant by june the cost estimates derived from this assessment are treated as worst case 
most of the company s shopping centers are open air type and are simple and very limited in terms of technology 
field systems for shopping center hvac  sprinkler and lighting are more than reviewed and year compliant for those systems supplied by the company some are supplied by tenants 
the systems not supplied by the company  the number of which is small  are being reviewed and are projected to not have a material impact 
all of the apartment communities have had reviews completed and  except for phone systems as discussed above  are year compliant 
costs related to the year issue the total historical or anticipated remaining costs for the year remediation are estimated to be immaterial to the company s financial condition 
the costs to date have been expensed as incurred and consist of immaterial internal staff costs and other expenses such as telephone and mailing costs 
the company currently estimates that to have all systems year compliant will require certain additional expenditures 
at this time  the expenditures are expected to range from a total of  to a worst case of  risks and contingency plans considering the substantial progress made to date  the company does not anticipate delays in finalizing internal year remediation within remaining time schedules 
however  third parties having a material relationship with the company eg  utilities  financial institutions  major tenants  suppliers  governmental agencies and municipalities may be a potential risk based on their individual year preparedness which may not be within the company s reasonable control 
the failure of critical third parties computer software programs and operating systems to achieve year compliance may result in system malfunctions or failures 
such an occurrence would potentially affect the ability of the third party to operate its business and thereby raise adequate revenue to meet its contractual obligations to the company or provide services to the company 
in that event  the company may not receive revenue or services that it had otherwise expected to receive pursuant to existing leases and contracts 
the failure of critical third parties to achieve year compliance may have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company is in the process of identifying and reviewing the year preparedness of critical third parties 
anticipated completion of this review is may  pending the results of that review  the company will determine what course of action and contingencies  if any  will need to be made 
although the company s year efforts are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on the company s business  operating results and financial condition  the actual effects of the issue and the success or failure of the company s efforts cannot be known until the year at this point  the company believes that the most likely external sources of a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition as a result of year issues are utilities ie  electricity  natural gas  telephone service and water furnished by third parties to the company and a wide universe of other customers  none of which utilities are readily available from alternate sources 
the reasonably likely worst case scenario that could affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be a widespread prolonged power failure affecting a substantial number of the geographic regions in which the company s properties are located 
in the event of such a widespread prolonged power failure  a significant number of tenants may not be able to operate their stores and  as a result  their ability to pay rent could be substantially impaired 
the company is not aware of an economically feasible contingency plan which could be implemented to prevent such a power failure from having a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the merger immediately following the merger on september   approximately million shares of common stock were outstanding and former holders of the trust s common shares held approximately of those shares 
as provided in the merger agreement  since september   the board of directors of the company has consisted of the six former members of excel s board and the nine former members of the trust s board

funds from operations the company calculates funds from operations ffo as net income attributable to common shareholders on a diluted basis before gain or loss on sales of real estate and securities  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate and amortized leasing commission costs  and other non recurring items 
ffo is not a substitute for cash flows from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo is presented because industry analysts and the company consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of performance of reits 
the following information is included to show the items included in the company s ffo for the past three years in thousands  except per share amounts five months five months ended ended december  year ended december  july  year ended year ended unaudited july  july  net income      preferred dividends    minority interest net income applicable to common shareholders diluted      gains loss on real estate and securities depreciation and amortization      funds from operations      weighted average of common shares outstanding diluted      on a pro forma basis  ffo would have been   and  for the twelve months ended december   the five months ended december  and  had the merger been consummated on august  and  respectively 
economic conditions the majority of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  the company believes that many of its existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental such rates may be increased to current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of such leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
many regions of the united states  including regions in which the company owns property  may experience economic recessions 
such recessions  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some existing tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by discount department stores  supermarkets and drug stores which usually offer day to day necessities rather than high priced luxury items 
these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally continue to maintain their volume of sales despite a slowdown in economic conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company had approximately million of outstanding floating rate debt 
the company does not believe that the interest rate risk represented by its floating rate debt is material as of that date in relation to the approximately billion of outstanding total debt of the company  the approximately billion of total assets of the company and the approximately billion market capitalization of the company s common stock as of that date 
the company was not a party to any hedging agreements with respect to its floating rate debt as of december  in the event of a significant increase in interest rates  the company would consider entering into hedging agreements with respect to all or a portion of its floating rate debt 
although hedging agreements would enable the company to convert floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities  such agreements would expose the company to the risk that the counterparties to such hedge agreements may not perform  which could increase the company s exposure to rising interest rates 
generally  however  the counterparties to hedging agreements that the company would enter into would be major financial institutions 
the company may borrow additional money with floating interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits of any hedging agreements that the company may enter into in the future  would increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect cash flow and the ability of the company to service its debt 
if the company enters into any hedging agreements in the future  decreases in interest rates thereafter would increase the company s interest expense as compared to the underlying floating rate debt and could result in the company making payments to unwind such agreements 
as of december   the company had notes receivable in the total amount of approximately canadian million approximately us million as of december  
the company does not believe that the foreign currency exchange risk associated with these loans is material 
the company had no other material exposure to market risk including foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk as of december
