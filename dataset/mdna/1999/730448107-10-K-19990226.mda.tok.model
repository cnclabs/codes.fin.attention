natural gas thailand prices 
the price that the company receives under the gas sales agreement for its natural gas production from the thailand concession normally adjusts on a semi annual basis 
however  the gas sales agreement provides for adjustment on a more frequent basis in the event that certain indices and factors on which the price is based fluctuate outside a given range 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and related production 
due to the volatility of the thai baht and the current economic difficulties in the kingdom of thailand and throughout southeast asia  the price that the company receives under the gas sales agreement adjusted several times during  and almost monthly in the latter half of the company cannot predict what the baht to dollar exchange rate may be in the future

commencing on october   the company and its joint venture partners in the thailand concession have been delivering less natural gas than is being nominated by ptt under the gas sales agreement 
this could result in the company receiving only of the current contract price on a portion of its future natural gas sales to ptt 
the company is taking actions that it currently believes will minimize the penalty that it will incur on future gas sales to ptt by  among other things  increasing production from the tantawan field 
as of december   the company was not a party to any future natural gas sales contracts 
crude oil and condensate thailand prices 
since the inception of production from the tantawan field  crude oil and condensate has been stored on the fpso until an economic quantity was accumulated for offloading and sale

the increase in lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand for  compared to  was primarily related to the fact that prior to the commencement of production in the tantawan field on february   no lease operating expenses were incurred by the company in thailand 
a substantial portion of the company s lease operating expenses in the kingdom of thailand relate to lease payments made by tantawan services  llc  in connection with its bareboat charter of the fpso  which amounted to  and  net to the company s interest for and  respectively 
see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements  other material long term commitments 
in addition to the reasons discussed above  north american lease operating expenses for  compared to  also increased due to a shortage of qualified offshore service contractors  which permitted such contractors to increase the costs of their services significantly during  increased expenses related to the leasing of certain equipment in the gulf of mexico  a year to year increase in the level of the company s operating activities  including increased operating costs related to additional properties brought on production and an increased ownership interest in certain properties as a result of the acquisition of such interests also contributed to the increase

dry hole and impairment expenses dry hole and impairment expenses relate to costs of unsuccessful wells drilled  along with impairments resulting from the application of sfas no 
due to decreases in expected reserves from producing wells

depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses the company accounts for its oil and gas activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and all development costs are capitalized 
proved properties are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of such property on the company s books may not be recoverable 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed when circumstances suggest the need for such a review and  if required  he proved properties are written down to their estimated fair value 
estimated fair value includes the estimated present value of all reasonably expected future production  prices  and costs 
as a result of poor reservoir performance and persistent low oil and gas prices  the company performed such a review in and expensed  related to its domestic oil and gas properties which is included in the consolidated statements of income as dry hole and impairment expense 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized until the results are determined 
if proved reserves are not discovered  the exploratory drilling costs are expensed 
other exploratory costs are expensed as incurred 
the provision for dd a expense is based on the capitalized costs  as determined in the preceding paragraph  plus future costs to abandon offshore wells and platforms  and is determined on a cost center by cost center basis using the units of production method 
the company generally creates cost centers on a field by field basis for oil and gas activities in the gulf of mexico and gulf of thailand 
generally  the company establishes cost centers on the basis of an oil or gas trend or play for its oil and gas activities onshore in the united states and canada 
the increase in the company s dd a expenses for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in the company s composite rate  that was not entirely offset by a decline in the company s natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production 
the increase in the company s dd a expenses for  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in the company s natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the company s composite dd a rate 
the increase in the composite dd a rate for all of the company s producing fields for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increased percentage of the company s production coming from certain of the company s fields that have dd a rates that are higher than the company s recent historical composite rate and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the company s production coming from fields that have dd a rates that are lower than the company s recent historical composite dd a rate 
management currently anticipates that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future  resulting in generally increasing dd a rates 
interest interest charges 
the increase in the company s interest charges for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the average amount of the company s outstanding debt and  to a lesser extent  increased average interest rates on the debt outstanding resulting primarily from the issuance of the notes on may   which bear interest at an annual interest rate 
as of december   the company was not a party to any interest rate swap agreements 
management currently expects the average interest rate on its outstanding debt to continue to increase due to the issuance of the notes on january   which bear interest at a interest rate 
capitalized interest 
the increase in capitalized interest for  compared to and  resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of capital expenditures subject to interest capitalization during  compared to  and  and from an increase in the computed rate that the company uses to apply on such capital expenditures to arrive at the total amount of capitalized interest 
a substantial percentage of the company s capitalized interest expense during the latter half of and resulted from capitalization of interest related to capital expenditures for the development of the benchamas field in the gulf of thailand and  to a lesser extent  several development projects in the gulf of mexico 
foreign currency transaction gain loss the foreign currency transaction gain and loss each resulted primarily from the fluctuation against the us dollar of cash and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in thai baht that were on the company s subsidiary s financial statements during the respective periods 
in early july  the government of the kingdom of thailand announced that the value of the baht would be set against the dollar and other currencies under a managed float program arrangement 
this led to a substantial decline in value of the thai baht compared to the us dollar  resulting in the foreign currency transaction losses during during  the value of the thai baht has generally strengthened against the us dollar  resulting in corresponding foreign currency transaction gains 
however  the company cannot predict what the thai baht to dollar exchange rate may be in the future 
moreover  it is anticipated that this exchange rate will remain volatile 
as of december   the company was not a party to any financial instrument that was intended to constitute a foreign currency hedging arrangement 
income tax benefit expense the company s income tax benefit for  compared to its income tax expenses for and  resulted primarily from a pre tax loss resulting from substantially lower revenues in the united states and the tax benefit of accrued foreign losses from the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand

other matters inflation 
publicly held companies are asked to comment on the effects of inflation on their business 
currently annual inflation in terms of the decrease in the general purchasing power of the us dollar is running much below the general annual inflation rates experienced in the past

southeast asia economic issues 
a substantial portion of the company s oil and gas operations are conducted in southeast asia  and a substantial portion of its natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon production is sold there 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  have experienced severe economic difficulties which have been characterized by sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
the government of the kingdom of thailand and other governments in the region are currently acting to address these issues 
however  the economic difficulties currently being experienced in thailand  together with the volatility of the thai baht against the us dollar  will continue to have a material impact on the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand  together with the prices that the company receives for its oil and natural gas production there 
see results of operations  oil and gas revenues and results of operations  foreign currency transaction gain loss 
all of the company s current natural gas production from the thailand concession is committed under a long term gas sales agreement to ptt at a price denominated in thai baht which is determined in accordance with a formula that is intended to ameliorate  at least in part  any decline in the purchasing power of the thai baht against the us dollar 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and business miscellaneous  sales 
although the company currently believes that ptt will honor its commitments under the gas sales agreement  a failure by ptt to honor such commitments could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s crude oil and condensate production from the thailand concession is currently sold on a tanker load by tanker load basis 
prices that the company receives for such production are based on world benchmark prices  which are denominated in us dollars  and are typically paid in us dollars 
see business international operations  contractual terms governing the thailand concession and related production and business miscellaneous  sales 
the company believes that the current economic difficulties in southeast asia have resulted in a decreased demand for petroleum products in the region  which has contributed to the recent general decline in crude oil and condensate prices throughout the world 
this price decline has had an adverse effect on all oil and gas companies that sell their production on the world spot markets  including the company  without regard to where their respective production is located 
year readiness disclosure 
many computer software systems  as well as certain hardware and equipment using date sensitive data  were structured to use a two digit date field meaning that they may not be able to properly recognize dates in the year the company is addressing this issue through a process that entails evaluation of the company s critical software and  to the extent possible  its hardware and equipment to identify and assess year issues and to remediate  replace or establish alternative procedures addressing non year compliant systems  hardware and equipment 
the company has substantially completed an inventory of its systems and equipment including computer systems and business applications 
based upon this review  the company currently believes that all of its critical software and computer hardware systems are either year compliant or will be within the next six months 
the company continues to inventory its equipment and facilities to determine if they contain embedded date sensitive technology 
if problems are discovered  remediation  replacement or alternative procedures for non compliant equipment and facilities will be undertaken on a business priority basis 
this process will continue and  depending upon the equipment and facilities  is scheduled for completion during the first three quarters of as of december   the company had incurred approximately  in expenses related to its year compliance efforts 
these costs are currently being expensed as they are incurred 
however  in certain instances the company may determine that replacing existing equipment may be more efficient  particularly where additional functionality is available 
these replacements may be capitalized and therefore would reduce the estimated expenses associated with the year issue 
the company currently expects total out of pocket costs to become year compliant to be less than  the company currently expects that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  operations or liquidity 
the foregoing timetable and assessment of costs to become year compliant reflect management s current best estimates 
these estimates are based on many assumptions  including assumptions about the cost  availability and ability of resources to locate  remediate and modify affected systems  equipment and facilities 
based upon its activities to date  the company does not currently believe that these factors will cause results to differ significantly from those estimated 
however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial condition and operations if key third parties including  among others  suppliers  contractors  joint venture partners  financial institutions  customers and governments do not become year compliant on a timely basis 
the company is contacting many of these third parties to determine whether they will be able to resolve in a timely fashion their year issues as they may affect the company 
in the event that the company is unable to complete the remediation or replacement of its critical systems  facilities and equipment  establish alternative procedures in a timely manner  or if those with whom the company conducts business are unsuccessful in implementing timely solutions  year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
at this time  the potential effect in the event the company and or third parties are unable to timely resolve their year problems is not determinable  however  the company currently believes that it will be able to resolve its own year issues in a timely manner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces  purchases and sells natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
in the past  the company has made limited use of a variety of derivative financial instruments only for non trading purposes as a hedging strategy to manage commodity prices associated with oil and gas sales and to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations 
see business competition and market conditions 
as discussed earlier  the company was not party to any derivative financial instruments during interest rate risk from time to time  the company has entered into various financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
currently  the company has no open interest rate swap or interest rate lock agreements 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from its short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts stated in thousands and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  fair thereafter total liabilities long term debt variable rate     average interest rate fixed rate   average interest rate value liabilities long term debt variable rate  average interest rate fixed rate  average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in thai baht and the canadian dollar and is therefore subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
the company conducts a substantial portion of its oil and gas production and sales in southeast asia 
southeast asia in general  and the kingdom of thailand in particular  have experienced severe economic difficulties  including sharply reduced economic activity  illiquidity  highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates and unstable stock markets 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations  foreign currency transaction gain loss and liquidity and capital resources  other matters  southeast asia economic issues 
however  the economic difficulties in thailand and the volatility of the thai baht against the us dollar will continue to have a material impact on the company s thailand operations and prices that the company receives for its oil and gas production there 
although the company s sales to ptt under the gas sales agreement are denominated in baht  because predominantly all of the company s crude oil sales and its capital and most other expenditures in the kingdom of thailand are dominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for the company s operations in the kingdom of thailand 
exposure from market rate fluctuations related to activities in canada  where the company s functional currency is the canadian dollar  is not material at this time
