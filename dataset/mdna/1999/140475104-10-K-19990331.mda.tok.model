the assumption and release agreement and wmfc note mature in january and january  respectively 
the senior living communities acquired by the company from gramercy and tesson are gramercy hill in lincoln  nebraska and tesson heights  in st 
louis  missouri 
the acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations  and the company s operations have included the operations of tesson heights and gramercy hill since october  from through december   the company acquired interests in communities and entered into an operating lease with respect to one community  which was terminated effective january  since  the company expanded its senior living management services by entering into the management service contracts on communities for four independent third party owners and commenced providing development and construction management services for new residence properties in addition to adding a home care service agency 
the company generates revenue from a variety of sources 
for the year ended december   the company s revenue was derived as follows from the operation of owned communities that were operated by the company  from lease rentals from triple net leases of three skilled nursing facilities and four physical rehabilitation centers  from management fees arising from management services provided for four affiliate owned senior living communities from january  through september  and one affiliate owned senior living community from january  through december  and third party owned senior living communities  and from development fees earned for managing the development and construction of new senior living communities for third parties 
the company believes that the factors affecting the financial performance of communities managed under contracts with third parties do not vary substantially from the factors affecting the performance of owned and leased communities  although there are different business risks associated with these activities 
the company s third party management fees are primarily based on a percentage of gross revenues 
as a result  the cash flow and profitability of such contracts to the company are more dependent on the revenues generated by such communities and less dependent on net cash flow than for owned communities 
further  the company is not responsible for capital investments in managed communities 
while the management contracts are generally terminable only for cause  in certain cases the contracts can be terminated upon the sale of a community  subject to the company s rights to offer to purchase such community 
the company s triple net leases extend through the year for three of its owned communities and through the year for four of its owned communities 
the payments under these leases are fixed and are not subject to change based upon the operating performance of these communities 
following termination of the lease agreements  the company may either convert and operate the communities as assisted living and alzheimer s care facilities  sell the facilities or evaluate other alternatives 
the company s current management contracts expire on various dates between december and september and provide for management fees based generally upon rates that vary by contract from of net revenues to of net revenues 
in addition  certain of the contracts provide for supplemental incentive fees that vary by contract based upon the financial performance of the managed community 
the company s development fees are generally based upon a percentage of construction cost and are earned over the period commencing with the initial development activities and ending with the opening of the community 
as of december   development fees have been earned for services performed for communities under development or expansions for third parties 
during   and  the company made various purchases of limited partnership interests in hcp 
hcp owns and operates a skilled nursing facility and owns and leases to third party operators under triple net leases three skilled nursing facilities and four physical rehabilitation centers 
during   and  the company paid approximately    and  respectively  for partnership interests in hcp 
the company changed its method of accounting for its investment in hcp from the cost method in to the equity method in as a result of additional purchases  the company s ownership interest in hcp exceeded on june  accordingly  this partial acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting  and the assets  liabilities  minority interest  and the results of operations of hcp have been consolidated in the company s financial statements since january  the company acquired  on november   the nhp notes owned by cslc in the formation transactions for  the nhp notes bear simple interest at per annum and mature on december  interest is currently paid quarterly at a rate of  with the remaining interest deferred 
beginning november  through september   the company has been recording interest income at of the purchase price paid  which was determined based on the discounted amount of principal and interest payments to be made following the maturity date december  of the nhp notes using a six month lag between maturity and full repayment  due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate realization of the accrued interest 
on september   the company purchased four properties from nhp 
nhp is in turn redeeming  of the company s investment in the nhp notes and is distributing approximately  of deferred interest not previously paid on such notes 
from october  through december   the company reevaluated its investment in the nhp notes  and is recording additional income  after giving consideration to current payment of interest  partial redemption of the nhp notes with accrued interest and the estimated residual value in nhp 
also  during and  the company paid and  for and  respectively  ownership of limited partnership interests in nhp 
the company accounts for its investment in nhp on the cost method with respect to the nhp limited partnership interests and as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost with respect to the nhp notes 
the company will continue to develop and acquire senior living communities 
the development of senior living communities typically involves a substantial commitment of capital over a to month construction period during which time no revenues are generated  followed by a month lease up period 
the company anticipates that newly opened or expanded communities will operate at a loss during a substantial portion of the lease up period 
the company s growth strategy may also include the acquisition of senior living communities  home care agencies  and other properties or businesses that are complementary to the company s operations and growth strategy

year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize the year as a date other than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on ongoing assessments  the company has developed a program to modify or replace significant portions of its software and certain hardware  which are generally pc based systems  so that those systems will properly recognize and utilize dates beyond december  the company has substantially completed software reprogramming and software and hardware replacement as of december   with completion targeted for september  the company presently believes that these modifications and replacements of existing software and certain hardware will mitigate the year issue 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the costs of year remediation are not expected to be material based on the company s operations 
the company has assessed its exposure to operating equipment  and such exposure is not significant due to the nature of the company s business 
the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of determining whether or ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has completed most but not all necessary phases of its year program 
in the event that the company does not complete the current program or any additional phases  the company could incur disruptions to its operations 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems failure 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of its year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in mid and determine whether such a plan is necessary 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
inflation could  however  affect the company s future revenues and results of operations because of  among other things  the company s dependence on senior residents  many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  during inflationary periods  the company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
at december   the company had  million of variable rate debt tied to libor  consisting of one  revolving credit facility that matures on december  the bank one facility and one  credit facility that matures on october  the lehman facility 
the company expects to complete a refinancing of the lehman facility with long term fixed rate mortgage loans during the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the company will complete this refinancing as expected 
interest on the bank one facility is based on libor plus 
interest on the lehman facility is based on libor plus 
at december   the libor rate was 
an increase in interest rates will increase the amount of interest expense incurred by the company 
other notes payable of  consist of fixed rate mortgage loans
