item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are funds from operations and ebitda 
funds from operations is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales or write down of assets  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities  extraordinary items  gain loss on sale of assets and preferred dividends 
this data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
while the performance of individual centers and the management companies determines ebitda  the company s capital structure also influences funds from operations 
the most important component in determining ebitda and funds from operations is center revenues 
center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents  percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries 
minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents 
minimum rent will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level 
additionally  to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms  expense recoveries will increase 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table reflects the company s acquisitions in  and date acquired location acquisition centers villa marina marketplace january  marina del rey  california valley view center october  dallas  texas rimrock mall november  billings  montana vintage faire mall november  modesto  california pacific view formerly known as buenaventura mall december  ventura  california fresno fashion fair december  fresno  california huntington center december  huntington beach  california acquisition centers south towne center march  sandy  utah stonewood mall august  downey  california manhattan village august  manhattan beach  california the citadel mall december  colorado springs  colorado great falls marketplace december  great falls  montana acquisition centers ere yarmouth portfolio february  twelve properties in eight states south plains mall june  lubbock  texas westside pavilion july  los angeles  california village at corte madera june july corte madera  california carmel plaza august  carmel  california northwest arkansas mall december  fayetteville  arkansas denotes the company owns these centers through a joint venture partnership 
the financial statements include the results of these centers for periods subsequent to their acquisition 
many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the addition of these properties to the portfolio during  and many factors impact the company s ability to acquire additional properties including the availability and cost of capital  overall debt to market capitalization level  interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the company s criteria 
accordingly  management is uncertain whether during the balance of  and in future years  there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in revenues  net income and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the  and acquisition centers 
pacific view formerly known as buenaventura mall  crossroads mall boulder  huntington center and parklane mall are currently under redevelopment and are referred to herein as the redevelopment centers 
all other centers are referred to herein as the same centers 
the bankruptcy and or closure of an anchor  or its sale to a less desirable retailer  could adversely affect customer traffic in a center and thereby reduce the income generated by that center 
furthermore  the closing of an anchor could  under certain circumstances  allow certain other anchors or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center 
during  montgomery ward filed for bankruptcy 
the company has montgomery ward as an anchor in of its centers 
montgomery ward has indicated that it plans to cease operating at three of these locations 
the company is negotiating to recapture these locations and replace montgomery ward with another department store 
montgomery ward has not yet disclosed whether they will cease to operate any of its eight remaining stores at the centers 
if montgomery ward ceases to operate any of its stores and the company is unable to replace them with other tenants  it could have an adverse effect on a center 
in addition  the company s success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors  including general economic conditions  the ability of tenants to make rent payments  increases or decreases in operating expenses  occupancy levels  changes in demographics  competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases

year readiness disclosure the information provided below contains year statements and is a year readiness disclosure pursuant to pub 
l 
no 
year issues the year issue is the result of many existing computer programs and embedded technology using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or erroneous data which would cause disruptions of operations 
the company has initiated a year compliance program consisting of the following phases identification of year issues  assessment of year compliance of systems  remediation or replacement of non compliant systems  testing to verify compliance  and contingency planning  as appropriate 
this program includes a review of both information technology it and non it systems and is being supervised by the company s year team which consists of management as well as operational and it staff members 
on february   the company acquired several properties from various safeco corporation entities and is in the process of reviewing each property s year readiness 
such review is anticipated to be completed by june  see recent developments acquisitions 
the following disclosure provides information regarding the company s properties excluding those acquisition properties 
it systems the company has reviewed its core computer hardware systems and software programs to determine if such systems and programs will properly process dates in the year and thereafter 
based on manufacturer or vendor information  the company presently believes most of its critical computer hardware systems and software programs are substantially year compliant 
the company is aware of one critical hardware system which needs a year upgrade at a cost of approximately  the company is currently conducting its own evaluation and testing to verify compliance of its critical hardware systems and software and expects to conclude such testing by june  the most important software program to the company s operations is its property management and accounting software 
the company has been advised by its independent software vendor that it has completed its evaluation  testing and modification of this program and the necessary changes have been completed to achieve year compliance 
the company is conducting its own evaluation and testing to confirm this conclusion and expects to complete such testing by june the company completed its assessment of the year compliance of its non critical computer hardware systems and software programs by its target date of december  based on manufacturer or vendor information  the company presently believes that substantially all of its non critical hardware systems and software programs are year compliant 
year readiness disclosure  contined non it systems part of the company s year program also includes a review of the various operating systems of each of its portfolio properties and main offices 
these systems typically include embedded technology which complicates the company s year efforts 
examples of these types of systems include energy management systems  telecommunication systems  elevators  security systems and copiers 
the various operating systems have been assigned priorities based on the importance of the system to each property s operations and the potential impact of non compliance 
all of the company s properties have substantially completed their initial assessment of each system and are verifying year compliance through the manufacturers and or vendors of the systems 
approximately of the critical operating systems for which the company has received information from manufacturers or vendors are substantially year compliant as reported by such entities 
certain critical systems  energy management systems  one telephone system  and one parking access computer software system  will need year upgrades and the company is in the process of obtaining such upgrades at an aggregate cost of approximately  other non compliant critical systems are being upgraded by the manufacturer at no cost to the company or were previously scheduled for replacement or upgrades prior to january  with respect to approximately of its critical operating systems  the company has not received the necessary information to assess the year compliance of such systems 
the company is contacting these manufacturers vendors to obtain the information necessary to complete its year compliance assessment 
each property is preparing recommendations regarding the remediation and testing phases 
remediation and testing recommendations and time lines are prepared based on the importance of each system to the property s operations and information received from the manufacturer vendor 
the company plans to coordinate the testing phase with the manufacturers vendors of the systems  as appropriate 
the company established june  as its target date to complete the remediation and testing phases for the critical operating systems at each property 
the company will need the cooperation of its manufacturers vendors in providing information and testing assistance to meet this timeline for its critical operating systems 
if such cooperation is not provided  completion of these phases will be delayed 
the company expects the year program to continue beyond january  with respect to non critical operating systems and issues 
material third parties the company mailed surveys to its material vendors  utilities and tenants about their plans and progress in addressing the year issue 
those entities surveyed include the utilities for each mall ie  electric  gas  water  telephone and waste management companies  the largest tenants of the company based on the amount of their rent payments and certain anchor tenants 
as of this date  the company has received responses from approximately of those entities surveyed 
generally  the responses received state that the entity is in the process of addressing the year compliance issues and expects to achieve compliance prior to january  costs because the company s assessment  remediation and testing efforts are ongoing  the company is unable to estimate the actual costs of achieving year compliance for its it and non it systems 
based on information received from manufacturers vendors  the company presently anticipates that the assessment and remediation costs will not be material 
as of december   the company has not expended significant amounts since its evaluation of year issues has been primarily conducted by its own personnel 
the company does not separately record the internal costs incurred for its year compliance program 
such costs are primarily the related payroll costs for its personnel who are part of the year program 
risks as is true of most businesses  the company is vulnerable to external forces that might generally effect industry and commerce  such as utility company year compliance failures and related service interruptions 
in addition  failure of information and operating systems of tenants may delay the payment of rent to the company or impair their ability to operate 
a formal contingency plan has not yet been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company will continue to evaluate potential areas of risk and develop a contingency plan  as appropriate 
based on currently available information  the company believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not adversely affect the company s results of operations or its relationships with tenants or other third parties 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of third parties will not have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
funds from operations the company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is ffo 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit to be net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales or write down of assets  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations  as defined by gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
the following reconciles net income available to common stockholders to ffo shares amount shares amount amounts in thousands net income available to common stockholders   adjustments to reconcile net income to ffo basic minority interest   loss on early extinguishment of debt  gain on sale of wholly owned assets  loss on sale or write down of assets from unconsolidated entities pro rata  depreciation and amortization on wholly owned centers   depreciation and amortization on joint ventures and from the management companies pro rata   less depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan costs and interest rate caps   ffo basic     additional adjustment to arrive at ffo diluted impact of convertible preferred stock   n a n a impact of stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method impact of convertible debentures n a anti dilutive ffo diluted     funds from operations  continued calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic ffo 
weighted average number of shares includes the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for assuming the conversion of all outstanding op units 
the computation of ffo diluted and diluted average number of shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method 
convertible debentures for the twelve month period are anti dilutive and are not included 
on february   the company sold million of its series a preferred stock 
on june   the company sold million of its series b preferred stock 
the preferred stock can be converted on a one for one basis for common stock 
the preferred shares are not assumed converted for purposes of net income per share as they would be anti dilutive to that calculation 
the preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of ffo diluted per share as they are dilutive to that calculation 
included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was  for   for and  for inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the consumer price index 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
this reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
new pronouncements issued in march   the financial accounting standards board fasb  through its emerging issues task force eitf  concluded based on eitf  accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions  that all internal costs to source  analyze and close acquisitions should be expensed as incurred 
the company has historically capitalized these costs in accordance with gaap 
the company has adopted the fasb s interpretation effective march  and the impact was approximately per share reduction of net income and ffo diluted per share for in may   the fasb  through the eitf  modified the timing of recognition of revenue for percentage rent received from tenants in eitf  accounting for contingent rent in interim financial periods 
the company applied this accounting change as of april  the accounting change had the effect of deferring  of percentage rent in the second quarter of and  of percentage rent in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the fasb reversed eitf accordingly  the company has resumed accounting for percentage rent on the accrual basis 
the effect of these changes was that approximately  was deferred from the second and third quarters of to the fourth quarter of new pronouncements issued  continued in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will be effective for the company s financial statements for periods beginning january  the new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
changes in the fair values of those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company has not yet determined when it will implement sfas nor has it completed the complex analysis required to determine the impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  reducing interest rate exposure on certain long term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities  using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions  and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity
