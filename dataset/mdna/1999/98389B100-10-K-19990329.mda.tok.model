item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis northern states power company  a minnesota corporation nsp minnesota  has two significant subsidiaries northern states power company  a wisconsin corporation nsp wisconsin  and nrg energy  inc  a delaware corporation nrg 
nsp minnesota also has several other subsidiaries  including viking gas transmission company viking  energy masters international  inc emi  eloigne company eloigne  seren innovations  inc seren and ultra power technologies  inc ultra power 
nsp minnesota and its subsidiaries collectively are referred to as nsp 
all financial information pertaining to per share amounts and number of common shares outstanding has been adjusted to reflect a two for one stock split that occurred on june  financial objectives and results nsp s financial objectives are to achieve a return on equity in the top one fourth of the utility industry based on a three year average 
nsp s average return on common equity for the three years ending in was percent  which places nsp below the top quarter of the industry  which was approximately percent  and above the median industry average of approximately percent 
the total return to investors measured by dividends plus stock price appreciation on nsp common stock for the last five years averaged percent per year  matching the total average return for the electric industry 
nsp s stock price fell percent in  while the standard poor s s p electric utilities group increased in price by percent 
to increase dividends on a regular basis and maintain a long term average payout ratio of to percent 
nsp has increased its dividend for consecutive years 
in june  nsp s annualized common dividend rate was increased by cents per share  or percent  from to 
the dividend payout ratio was percent in  slightly outside the long term objective range 
to maintain long term average annual earnings per share growth of percent 
nsp s earnings per share have grown by an average annual rate of percent since to provide at least percent of nsp earnings from nrg by the year nrg provided cents  or percent  of nsp s earnings per share in cents  or percent  of nsp s earnings per share in to maintain continued financial strength with a aa rating for utility bonds 
nsp minnesota s first mortgage bonds were rated aa by fitch investors service  inc aa by s p aa by moody s investors services moody s aa by duff phelps  inc these ratings reflect the views of rating agencies  which can provide an explanation of the significance of the ratings 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency 
first mortgage bonds issued by nsp wisconsin carry comparable ratings 
business strategies nsp s mission is to be a recognized leader in the energy industry by increasing the value provided to our customers with energy related products and services 
we will utilize the skills and talents of our people to thrive in a dynamic and competitive energy environment that provides increased value for our customers and shareholders and significant growth opportunities for our company 
during  nsp developed the following point game plan to achieve this mission grow nrg nsp expects nrg to provide percent of nsp earnings in  one year ahead of schedule 
in addition  nrg s goal is to become a top independent power producer in each of its core markets north america  europe and asia pacific 
nrg expects to achieve these goals by profitably growing existing businesses and adding new businesses 
position nsp s generation business for long term value nsp s conventional plants include coal fired  hydro  refuse derived fuel  natural gas and oil fired facilities 
to ensure these assets remain valuable  nsp will make careful investments in these facilities to keep them reliable  efficient and competitive 
nsp is preparing to operate its generation facilities as a stand alone business in a competitive market 
create an independent nuclear generating company nsp s monticello and prairie island nuclear plants are extremely valuable assets 
with increasing regulation and associated costs in the nuclear industry  nsp believes the best way to enhance nsp s nuclear assets is to combine our plants with other well run nuclear plants and create a free standing nuclear generating company 
expand energy marketing to enhance nsp s position in the increasingly competitive electric market  nsp expanded its wholesale energy marketing efforts by establishing energy marketing within its generation business unit 
energy marketing is responsible for meeting the requirements of nsp s retail and wholesale electric customers for low cost energy  while optimizing margins from nsp s generation resources 
create an independent transmission company to foster competition in the wholesale electricity market  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc requires the transmission portion of a utility s business to be functionally separate from the utility s generation facilities 
the state of wisconsin also calls for a separate transmission operating structure 
nsp believes the best way to ensure a reliable  efficient  customer focused and investor responsive electric transmission network is to create a for profit  independent transmission company 
expand nsp s core electric and gas distribution business to expand our core business  nsp will actively seek to acquire and merge with other energy companies 
develop seren seren has moved into the telecommunications business  with plans to deliver high speed internet access  video on demand  telephone service and cable tv 
seren is currently constructing a broadband network in st 
cloud  minn 
further expansion and development is anticipated 
grow viking nsp s goal is to continue the growth of viking through pipeline expansion 
drive emi to profitability emi is moving toward profitability by reducing costs and narrowing its focus to concentrate on retrofitting and upgrading customer facilities for greater energy efficiency 
as part of its effort to concentrate on federal facilities  emi has been selected as a qualified vendor by the us department of energy and department of defense 
manage nsp s entire business as a portfolio nsp will manage its collective businesses as a portfolio of assets with a focus on growth 
nsp will acquire or divest businesses and assets if it will increase shareholder value 
financial review the following discussion and analysis by management focuses on those factors that had a material effect on nsp s financial condition and results of operations during and  or are expected to have a material impact in the future 
it should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and notes 
except for the historical statements contained in this report  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  expect  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures business conditions in the energy industry competitive factors unusual weather changes in federal or state legislation regulation issues relating to year remediation efforts the higher risk associated with nsp s nonregulated businesses as compared with nsp s regulated business the items described under factors affecting results of operations the other risk factors listed from time to time by nsp in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  including exhibit to nsp s report on form k results of operations compared with and nsp s earnings per share for the past three years were as follows earnings per share diluted regulated utility operations excluding merger costs nonregulated operations subtotal excluding merger costs write off of merger costs total revenue and expense items affecting earnings in these periods are discussed later

electric retail sales growth increased in due to strong economic conditions in nsp s service territory 
electric retail sales growth increased in due to economic conditions  partially offset by unfavorable average temperatures compared with favorable average temperatures in sales for resale volumes and revenues increased in due to the expansion of nsp s energy marketing operations 
sales for resale volumes decreased in due to constraints on nsp s system from unscheduled plant outages and storms 
revenues from sales to other utilities increased in due to higher market prices 
electric margin as shown in the table below  electric margin equals electric revenue minus related production expenses  which includes electric fuel and power purchase costs 
millions of dollars electric revenue fuel for electric generation purchased and interchange power electric margin electric production expenses tend to vary with changing retail and wholesale sales requirements and unit cost changes in fuel and purchased power 
however  due to fuel clause cost recovery mechanisms for retail customers and the ability to vary wholesale prices with changing market conditions  most fluctuations in production expenses do not affect electric margin  as shown below

the firm sales decrease was due to more unfavorable weather in  compared with  partially offset by sales growth 
also  interruptible sales declined in because favorable alternate fuel prices  as compared with natural gas  caused interruptible customers to purchase less natural gas 
the interruptible sales decrease also was due to the ability of customers to switch to transportation only service 
the decrease in firm sales in was primarily due to the impacts of favorable weather in and unfavorable weather in  partially offset by sales growth 
the weather adjusted sales growth was partially offset by lost gas sales as a result of flooding in the grand forks area

business interruptions in included flooding in nsp s service area  an unscheduled baseload nuclear plant outage and storm damage to transmission lines 
technology improvements included development of customer information  automated meter reading and other systems  including year remediation 
cost increases were partially offset by a million decrease in administrative and general expenses  reflecting decreases in insurance and employee benefit costs 
depreciation and amortization costs increased million in and million in primarily due to higher levels of depreciable plant  including new information systems and equipment with relatively short useful lives

the decrease is due primarily to lower average short term borrowing levels  and the retirement of million of first mortgage bonds in october the average short term debt balance for utility operations was million in  million in and million in merger costs in may  nsp and wisconsin energy corporation wec mutually terminated their plans to merge 
nsp s earnings for include a pretax charge to nonoperating expense of million  or cents per share  to write off its cumulative merger related costs incurred 
preferred dividends dividends paid to preferred shareholders declined by million in and million in due to the redemption of several series of preferred stock during those years 
nonregulated business results nsp anticipates that the earnings from nonregulated operations will experience more variability than regulated utility businesses  due to the nature of these nonregulated businesses 
a description of nsp s primary nonregulated businesses and their earnings contribution is summarized below 
nrg is primarily involved in independent power production  commercial and industrial heating and cooling  and energy related refuse derived fuel production 
nrg s business strategy includes holding a portfolio of nonregulated energy projects on both a wholly owned and joint venture basis 
the divestitures of partial or entire interests in projects when the economics maximize shareholder value is a continuing part of nrg s strategy 
emi is primarily an energy services company 
eloigne invests in affordable housing 
seren provides broadband communication services 
contribution to nsp s earnings per share nrg emi eloigne seren other total nrg nrg s earnings increased in  compared with  primarily due to income from new projects  including el segundo  long beach  certain pacific generation company pgc operations  an increase in nrg s holdings in energy developments limited and higher earnings from loy yang 
in addition  nrg s landfill gas subsidiary  neo  entered into projects in and that are generating higher levels of energy tax credits 
increased earnings were partially offset by higher interest costs due to the million senior notes issued in mid  interest on nrg s revolving line of credit and new debt obtained for certain neo projects and the purchase of pgc 
also  nrg s earnings in were adversely affected by declines in the value of the australian dollar and german deutsche mark in relation to the us dollar 
if exchange rates throughout had stayed the same as the beginning of the year  nrg s earnings would have been approximately cent per share higher 
in december  nrg sold one half of its percent interest in enfield energy centre ltd 
eecl to an affiliate of el paso international for approximately million  resulting in an after tax gain to nrg of approximately million 
this gain increased earnings by approximately cents per share 
nrg continues to hold a percent interest in eecl 
also in  nrg recorded a charge of approximately million million after tax to write down its investment in a megawatt  coal fired power station in cilegon  west java  due to the political and economic instability in indonesia 
this write down reduced earnings by approximately cents per share 
nrg s earnings increased compared with largely due to income from new projects  including tax credits from neo 
new projects contributing to nrg s earnings include bolivian power company ltd 
cobee  pgc  schkopau and loy yang 
nrg s earnings also included gains on the sale of equity interests in two projects late in  offset by a write down of nrg s sunnyside project 
nrg s increased earnings in were partially offset by increased interest costs and declines in the value of the australian dollar and german deutsche mark in relation to the us dollar 
if exchange rates throughout stayed the same as the beginning of the year  nrg s earnings would have been approximately cents per share higher 
in the past  nsp has reported gains from divestitures of nrg projects and losses from write downs of nrg projects as nonrecurring items 
since its inception  nrg s investment in nonregulated energy projects has grown substantially 
nrg manages these projects as a portfolio and evaluates earnings enhancement opportunities and risks from unsuccessful ventures on an ongoing basis 
as such  nsp expects gains and losses to occur periodically 
therefore  while nsp will continue to disclose significant nrg gains and losses  we will no longer report these transactions as nonrecurring events 
further information on nrg s financial results may be obtained from nrg s annual report on form k filed with the sec 
emi emi s losses for were lower than  due to increased margins and losses incurred by enerval  a joint venture previously held by emi 
in june  emi sold its interest in enerval 
emi s investment in enerval was written down in the fourth quarter of and  as a result  the transaction had no material impact on earnings 
emi s losses for were higher than losses  primarily due to losses incurred by emi s gas marketing joint venture  enerval  the partial write down of emi s investment in enerval  and increased expenses related to combining operations with energy solutions international  inc and energy masters corporation  both purchased by emi in july these increased losses were partially offset by increased operating margins  primarily due to the curtailment of gas trading activity in the second quarter of  which negatively affected operating margins during the first half of other eloigne s earnings grew in and  due to new investments in affordable housing projects 
seren is experiencing losses as it develops its broadband communication services network in st 
cloud  minn 
factors affecting results of operations nsp s results of operations during  and primarily were dependent on its electric and gas utility businesses 
nsp s utility revenues depend on customer usage  which varies with weather conditions  general business conditions and the cost of energy services 
various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric and gas service within their respective jurisdictions 
in addition  nsp s nonregulated businesses are contributing to nsp s earnings 
the historical and future trends of nsp s operating results have been and are expected to be affected by the following factors regulation nsp s utility rates are approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and state regulatory commissions in minnesota  north dakota  south dakota  wisconsin  arizona and michigan 
rates are designed to recover plant investment  operating costs and an allowed return on investment  using an annual period upon which rate case filings are based 
nsp requests changes in rates for utility services as needed through filings with the governing commissions 
the rates charged to retail customers in wisconsin are reviewed and adjusted biennially 
because comprehensive rate changes are requested infrequently in minnesota  nsp s primary jurisdiction  changes in operating costs can affect nsp s earnings  shareholders equity and other financial results 
except for wisconsin electric operations  nsp s retail rate schedules provide for cost of energy and resource adjustments to billings and revenues for changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation  purchased energy  purchased gas and  in minnesota  conservation and energy management program costs 
for wisconsin electric operations  where cost of energy adjustment clauses are not used  the biennial retail rate review process and an interim fuel cost hearing process provide the opportunity for rate recovery of changes in electric fuel and purchased energy costs in lieu of a cost of energy adjustment clause 
in addition to changes in operating costs  other factors affecting rate filings are sales growth  conservation and demand side management efforts and the cost of capital 
regulated public utilities are allowed to record as assets certain costs that would be expensed by nonregulated enterprises and to record as liabilities certain gains that would be recognized as income by nonregulated enterprises 
if restructuring or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  nsp may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets and liabilities from its balance sheet 
such changes could have a material adverse effect on nsp s results of operations in the period the write off is recorded 
at dec 
  nsp reported on its balance sheet regulatory assets of approximately million and regulatory liabilities of approximately million that would need to be recognized in the income statement in the absence of regulation 
included in these regulatory assets are million of conservation expenditures that are expected to be recovered by the year in addition to a potential write off of regulatory assets and liabilities  deregulation and competition may require recognition of certain stranded costs not recoverable under market pricing 
nsp currently does not expect to write off to expense any stranded costs unless and until market price levels change or unless cost levels increase above market price levels 
see notes and to the financial statements for further discussion 
in june  the minnesota department of public service recommended the minnesota public utilities commission mpuc discontinue recovery of lost margins  load management discounts and performance incentives from conservation programs for nsp minnesota and other minnesota public utilities 
in november  the mpuc approved continued recovery of lost margins  discounts and performance bonuses for however  the mpuc put minnesota utilities on notice that there may be significant changes  including elimination of rate recovery  pending the outcome of a study 
a commission round table will study the issue and report its findings by may  in  nsp minnesota recorded approximately million  primarily in electric revenue  from the conservation incentives under review by the mpuc 
rate filings the status of nsp s recent rate and cost of service filings with regulators is summarized below in december  nsp minnesota filed an annual natural gas rate increase request of approximately million in minnesota 
an interim rate increase totaling million on an annualized basis was approved effective feb 
  subject to refund 
on dec 
  the mpuc issued its final order granting nsp minnesota a gas rate increase of million  or percent  on an annualized basis 
in november  nsp wisconsin filed a retail electric and gas rate case with the public service commission of wisconsin pscw  requesting an annual increase of approximately million  or percent  in retail electric rates and an annual decrease of million  or percent  in retail gas rates 
on sept 
  the pscw issued an order granting an electric rate increase of million  or percent  and a gas rate decrease of million  or percent  on an annual basis 
in february and march of  nsp filed wholesale electric point to point and nts rate cases with the ferc 
the proposed point to point rates would  if approved  increase third party transmission service revenue by approximately million and ancillary service revenues by million  annually 
the nts tariff change would  if approved  reduce nts costs from levels 
during april  the ferc voted to allow the proposed increases in point to point and ancillary service rates effective oct 
  subject to refund  and to consolidate the cases 
in late  nsp reached a settlement in principle with the parties to the case 
the settlement is expected to be filed in the first quarter of and is subject to ferc approval 
in june  viking filed a rate case with the ferc  requesting a million annual rate increase 
in december  viking arrived at a settlement in principle with parties to the case 
the final settlement will be filed in the first quarter of and is subject to ferc approval 
in december  nsp minnesota submitted a voluntary cost separation filing with the mpuc  which outlines the method nsp proposes to use to assign costs of its electric operations to business segments and state jurisdictions 
because of changes and increased competition in the electric industry  nsp wants to separate or unbundle its generation  transmission and distribution costs 
this filing does not propose to change electric rates for any of nsp s customers in minnesota 
an administrative law judge has been assigned to convene a technical conference of interested parties to discuss the merits of nsp s cost separation proposal 
a report is expected to be issued in the second quarter of competition the energy policy act of has been a catalyst for comprehensive and significant changes in the operation of electric utilities  including increased competition 
the act s reform of the public utility holding company act of puhca promoted creation of wholesale nonutility power generators and authorized the ferc to require utilities to provide wholesale transmission services to third parties 
the legislation allows utilities and nonregulated companies to build  own and operate power plants nationally and internationally without being subject to restrictions that previously applied to utilities under the puhca 
in  the ferc issued orders no 
and to foster competition in the electric utility industry 
these orders give competing wholesale suppliers the ability to transmit electricity through a utility s transmission system 
order no 
grants nondiscriminatory access to transmission service 
order no 
seeks to ensure a fair market by imposing standards of conduct on transmission system owners  by requiring separation of the wholesale power supply or merchant function from the transmission system operation function  and by mandating the posting of transmission availability and pricing information on an electronic bulletin board 
these new open access rules became effective in and in  the ferc issued clarifying final orders in response to rehearing requests by numerous market participants regarding orders no 
and these ferc clarifying final orders are currently being appealed in federal court 
nsp has made open access transmission tariff filings and compliance filings with the ferc and believes it is taking the proper steps to comply with the new rules as they become effective 
some states have begun to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier  and many other states are considering retail access proposals 
the minnesota legislature continues to study the issues  but has determined that further study is necessary before any action can be taken 
the pscw revised its restructuring plan  delaying the start of retail competition to the michigan public service commission approved a plan to begin offering a choice of suppliers to retail customers in selected markets in the timing of regulatory actions regarding restructuring and their impact on nsp cannot be predicted at this time and may be significant 
independent transmission company itc in april  nsp announced its intention to divest its electric transmission business to form an independent company unaffiliated with the rest of its utility operations 
several developments have occurred since this commitment was made 
in april  the wisconsin act became law 
act includes provisions that require the pscw to order a public utility that owns transmission facilities in wisconsin to transfer control of its transmission acilities to an independent system operator iso or divest the public utility s interest in its transmission facilities to an independent transmission owner ito if the public utility has not already transferred control to an iso or divested to an ito by june  under certain circumstances  the pscw has authority to waive imposition of such an order on june  at dec 
  the net book value of nsp wisconsin s transmission assets was approximately million 
in november  nsp and alliant energy alliant announced plans to develop an itc to provide transmission services to the upper midwest 
the two companies are developing a relationship by which nsp will create an itc  which will lease the transmission assets of alliant 
lease terms have not been finalized 
the itc is intended to be a publicly traded entity and not an affiliate of nsp or alliant 
nsp and alliant plan to seek the necessary approvals from state and federal regulators in  with the itc proposed to be operational in in november  the members of mid continent area power pool mapp rejected a proposal to establish a mapp iso 
in december  minnesota power company mp filed a complaint with the ferc  alleging that nsp violated its duty in a settlement agreement to work cooperatively to form an iso by voting against the mapp iso 
mp also wants nsp s transmission rate structure to be declared unreasonably discriminatory 
mp is requesting the ferc to order nsp to join the newly formed midwest iso  or to order nsp to charge the midwest iso regional rate and to revoke nsp s market rate authority 
due to the need for regulatory approval and other factors outside nsp s control  there is no guarantee that nsp will be successful in forming an itc  or that if an itc is formed it will include alliant 
in the event that nsp is successful in forming an itc  nsp would ultimately divest its electric transmission assets 
at dec 
  the net book value of nsp s transmission assets was approximately million 
if nsp is not successful in forming an itc  act currently would require the transfer of control of nsp wisconsin s transmission assets to an iso  unless a waiver is granted 
independent nuclear generating company in april  nsp announced its intention to divest its nuclear generation business to form an independent company unaffiliated with the rest of its utility operations 
during  in the first step toward this commitment  nsp  alliant  wec and wisconsin public service corp 
agreed to form a cooperative nuclear alliance to improve plant performance and reliability  strengthen operational efficiency  maintain high safety levels and reduce costs 
working teams are being organized to implement cooperative alliances in several areas  including fuel management  year initiatives  inventory management  information exchange and self assessment programs 
the four companies operate seven nuclear units at five sites with a total generation capacity exceeding  megawatts 
nsp continues to work with regulators and potential business partners toward the divestiture of its nuclear generation business 
at dec 
  the net book value of nsp s nuclear assets excluding decommissioning investments and obligations was approximately million 
energy marketing in april  nsp announced an initiative to expand its wholesale energy marketing efforts by formally establishing an energy marketing division within nsp s generation business unit 
during  energy marketing established a comprehensive risk management program 
since electricity cannot be stored  there is potential for extreme price volatility 
strict risk management is an integral element of energy marketing s business activity 
led the development of the minneapolis grain exchange mge electricity futures and option contracts 
the mge contracts provide nsp and the region an opportunity to hedge against the price volatility inherent in the electric market 
obtained market based rate approval from the ferc in june this enables energy marketing to sell energy at market prices in addition to selling under traditional cost based rates 
expanded the scale of nsp s electric sales for resale  increasing sales volume by approximately percent 
used nuclear fuel storage and disposal in  nsp received legislative authorization from the state of minnesota for the use of casks for temporary spent fuel storage at nsp s prairie island nuclear generating facility 
through the use of longer fuel cycles and utilization of temporary storage racks in the spent fuel pools  nsp has determined casks will allow operation of the facility until the first nine casks have been authorized by the minnesota environmental quality board meqb 
nsp had loaded seven of the casks as of dec 
 as a condition of the authorization  the minnesota legislature established several resource commitments for nsp  including wind and biomass generation sources as well as other requirements 
nsp is complying with these requirements 
the meqb has terminated an alternative siting process  which had been one of the original legislative requirements 
nsp and other utilities have an ongoing dispute with the us department of energy doe regarding the doe s statutory and contractual obligations to provide permanent storage and disposal facilities for nuclear fuel by jan 
  as required by the nuclear waste policy act of see notes and to the financial statements for more information 
year yk readiness to the extent allowed  the information in the following section is designated as a year readiness disclosure 
nsp is incurring significant costs to modify or replace existing technology  including computer software  for uninterrupted operation in the year and beyond 
in  nsp s board of directors approved funding to address development and remediation efforts related to yk 
a committee made up of senior management is leading nsp s initiatives to identify yk related issues and remediate business processes as necessary 
nsp s yk program covers not only nsp s  computer applications  consisting of about  programs and totaling more than million lines of code  but also the thousands of hardware and embedded system components in use throughout nsp 
embedded systems perform mission critical functions in all parts of operations  including power generation  transmission  distribution  communications and business operations 
nsp has implemented a yk methodology consistent with state of the art best practices and standards within the utility industry 
this seven step process includes discovery of possible date related logic in components  systems and processes assessment of potential problems development of a plan to address the problem remediation to resolve the problem testing to verify that the solutions are workable implementation of the solution into production closure through retesting and documentation and review by a separate internal due diligence committee nsp s timetable for yk completion is as of dec 
  percent of nsp s mission critical systems and processes were yk ready 
by march   completion of all yk efforts on percent of mission critical systems and processes 
by june   completion of all yk efforts on mission critical systems and processes  completion of all nuclear plant remediation in accordance with nuclear regulatory commission guidelines and finalization of all contingency planning 
by dec 
  complete remediation of low priority applications  complete all testing and implementation  and final closure 
nsp is communicating with its key suppliers and business partners regarding their yk progress  particularly in software and embedded component areas  to determine the areas in which nsp s operations may be vulnerable to those parties failure to complete their remediation efforts 
nsp is currently evaluating and initiating follow up actions regarding the responses from these parties as appropriate 
nsp is also working closely with the electric power research institute  mapp  the nuclear energy institute  the north american electric reliability council nerc and other utilities to enhance coordination  system reliability and compliance with industry and regulatory requirements 
in its fourth quarter report  nerc stated  findings continue to indicate that transition through critical yk dates is expected to have minimal impact on electric operations in north america 
nsp has made significant progress implementing its yk plan 
based upon the information currently known regarding its internal operations and assuming successful and timely completion of its remediation plan  nsp does not anticipate significant business disruptions from its internal systems due to the yk issue 
however  nsp may possibly experience limited interruptions to some aspects of its activities  relating to information technology  operations and administrative functions 
nsp is considering such potential occurrences in planning for its most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
in addition  risk exists regarding the noncompliance of third parties with key business or operational importance to nsp 
yk problems affecting key customers  interconnected utilities  fuel suppliers and transporters  telecommunications providers or financial institutions could result in lost power or gas sales  reductions in power production or transmission  or internal functional and administrative difficulties on the part of nsp 
nsp is not presently aware of any such situations  however  occurrences of this type  if severe  could have material adverse impacts upon the business  operating results or financial condition of nsp 
consequently  there can be no assurance that nsp will be able to identify and correct all aspects of the yk problem that affect it in sufficient time  or that the costs of achieving yk readiness will not be material 
nsp is currently updating contingency plans for all material yk risk and is on track to meet the contingency planning schedule set forth by nerc 
among the areas contingency planning will address are delays in completion of nsp s remediation plans  failure or incomplete remediation results and failure of key third party contacts to be yk compliant 
through  nsp had spent approximately million for yk efforts  which primarily is expensed as incurred 
the additional development and remediation costs necessary for nsp to prepare for yk is estimated to be approximately million 
environmental matters nsp incurs several types of environmental costs  including nuclear plant decommissioning  storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel  disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  remediation of contaminated sites and monitoring of discharges into the environment 
because of greater environmental awareness and increasingly stringent regulation  nsp has experienced increasing environmental costs 
this trend has caused  and may continue to cause  slightly higher operating expenses and capital expenditures for environmental compliance 
in addition to nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal expenses  costs charged to nsp s operating expenses for environmental monitoring and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes were approximately million in million in million in nsp expects to average approximately million per year for the five year period however  the precise timing and amount of environmental costs  including those for site remediation and disposal of hazardous materials  are currently unknown 
capital expenditures on environmental improvements at its utility facilities  which include the costs of constructing spent nuclear fuel storage casks  were approximately million in million in million in nsp expects to incur approximately million in capital expenditures for compliance with environmental regulations in and approximately million for the five year period see notes and to the financial statements for further discussion of these and other environmental contingencies 
weather nsp s earnings can be significantly affected by unusual weather 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase electric and gas sales 
unseasonably mild weather reduces electric and gas sales 
the following summarizes the estimated impact on nsp s earnings due to temperature variations from historical averages 
weather in decreased earnings by an estimated cents per share weather in decreased earnings by an estimated cents per share weather in increased earnings by an estimated cents per share impact of nonregulated investments a significant portion of nsp s earnings comes from nonregulated operations 
nsp expects to continue investing in nonregulated projects  including domestic and international power production projects through nrg 
the nonregulated projects in which nsp or its subsidiaries have invested and may invest in the future carry a higher level of risk than nsp s traditional utility businesses due to a number of factors  including competition  operating risks  dependence on certain suppliers and customers and domestic and foreign environmental and energy regulations  partnership and government actions and foreign government  political  economic and currency risks  and development risks  including uncertainties prior to final legal closing 
most of nrg s current project investments as listed in note to the financial statements consist of minority interests  and a substantial portion of future investments may take the form of minority interests  which may limit nrg s financial risk and ability to control the development or operation of the projects 
in addition  significant expenses may be incurred for projects pursued by nrg that do not materialize 
the aggregate effect of these factors creates the potential for volatility in the nonregulated component of nsp s earnings 
accordingly  the historical operating results of nsp s nonregulated businesses may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
use of derivatives and market risk nsp uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on nrg s international project cash flows  natural gas prices on emi s margins  electricity prices on energy marketing s margins and interest rates on the cost of borrowing 
the fair value of nrg s foreign currency contracts is sensitive to market risk as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of dec 
  a percent appreciation in foreign exchange rates from prevailing market rates would decrease the market value of nrg s foreign currency contracts by approximately million 
conversely  a percent depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would increase the market value by approximately million 
emi is exposed to market risk through changes in market prices of natural gas forward and futures contracts 
as of dec 
  a percent increase in natural gas forward and futures prices would result in a gain on these contracts of approximately million 
conversely  a percent decrease in natural gas forward and futures prices would result in a loss on these contracts of approximately million 
these hypothetical gains and losses on natural gas forward and futures contracts would be offset by the gains and losses on the underlying commodities being hedged 
nsp s energy marketing division is exposed to market risk of changes in market prices of electricity 
the market risk of these energy futures contracts is immaterial 
market risk associated with nsp s interest rate swap agreement results from short term interest rate fluctuations 
this market risk is not material since this swap expired on feb 
 see notes and to the financial statements for further discussion of nsp s financial instruments and derivatives 
accounting changes the financial accounting standards board fasb has proposed new accounting standards that would require the full accrual of nuclear plant decommissioning and certain other site exit obligations 
material adjustments to nsp s balance sheet would occur upon implementation of the fasb s proposal  which does not currently have a scheduled effective date 
however  the effects of regulation are expected to minimize or eliminate any impact on operating expenses and earnings from this future accounting change 
for further discussion of the expected impact of this change  see note to the financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet and all changes in fair value be recognized currently in earnings or deferred as a component of other comprehensive income  depending on the intended use of the derivative  its resulting designation and its effectiveness 
nsp is required to adopt this standard in  but can elect to adopt it earlier 
nsp has not determined the potential impact of implementing this statement or its expected adoption date 
inflation inflation at its current level is not expected to materially affect nsp s prices or returns to shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources financing requirements nsp s need for capital funds primarily is related to the construction of plant and equipment to meet the needs of electric and gas utility customers and to fund equity commitments or other investments in nonregulated businesses 
in total utility capital expenditures including afc were million 
of that amount  million related to replacements and improvements of nsp s electric system and nuclear fuel  and million involved construction of natural gas facilities  including viking 
nsp companies mainly nrg and eloigne invested approximately million for equity interests in and loans to nonregulated projects  for the acquisition of existing businesses and for additions to nonregulated property 
financing activity during  nsp s sources of capital included internally generated funds and external financings 
the allocation of financing requirements between these capital resources is based on the relative cost of each resource  regulatory restrictions and nsp s long range capital structure objectives 
a capital structure consisting of percent common equity at year end contributes to nsp s financial flexibility and strength 
the following summarizes the financing sources used in internal funds funds generated internally from operating cash flows in remained sufficient to meet working capital needs  debt service  dividend payout requirements and construction expenditures  as well as to fund a significant portion of nonregulated investment commitments 
nsp s stated goal for its pretax interest coverage ratio for utility operations is the utility pretax interest coverage ratio  excluding afc  was in  in and in  which falls within the range 
internally generated funds from utility operations could have provided financing for more than percent of nsp s utility capital expenditures for and approximately percent of the billion in utility capital expenditures incurred for the five year period the pretax interest coverage ratio  excluding afc  for all nsp operations was in  in and in external financing nsp s short term debt availability and usage is described in note to the financial statements 
in general  short term borrowings are used to provide temporary financing  mainly for nsp minnesota and nrg  for utility capital expenditures  nonregulated projects and other short term cash needs 
nsp s long term debt and capital stock activity are shown on the statements of capitalization and stockholders equity 
these sources are used to provide permanent financing for both regulated and nonregulated business activities 
in addition to funding current year capital needs  external financing activities also reflect nsp s management of its capital structure to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
nsp s nonregulated construction expenditures and equity investments in nonregulated projects were primarily financed through internally generated funds and the issuance of debt by nonregulated subsidiaries 
project financing requirements  in excess of equity contributions from investors  were satisfied with project debt and loans from nsp s nonregulated businesses  mainly nrg 
project debt associated with many of nsp s nonregulated investments is not reflected in nsp s balance sheet because the equity method of accounting is used for such investments 
see note to the financial statements 
loans made by nsp to nonregulated projects are reflected separately on the balance sheet as notes receivable from nonregulated projects 
future financing requirements nsp currently estimates that its utility capital expenditures will be million in and billion for the five year period of the amount  approximately million is scheduled for electric utility facilities and approximately million for natural gas facilities  including viking 
in addition to utility capital expenditures  expected financing requirements for the five year period include approximately million to retire long term debt and fund principal maturities 
if nsp carries out its game plan to divest transmission and nuclear generation assets  capital expenditures would be significantly lower 
another game plan item  expansion of nsp s utility distribution  includes possible business combinations that may require substantial issuance of capital 
through its subsidiaries  nsp expects to invest significant amounts in nonregulated projects in the future 
financing requirements for nonregulated project investments will vary depending on the success  timing and level of involvement in projects currently under consideration 
potential capital requirements for nonregulated projects and property  which include acquisitions and project investments  are estimated to be approximately billion in and approximately billion for the five year period the nonregulated capital requirements reflect nrg s expected acquisitions of existing generation facilities  including arthur kill  astoria  somerset  dunkirk  huntley and encina 
a significant portion of these capital requirements is expected to be financed by nonrecourse project debt 
nsp and its subsidiaries continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareholder returns and achieve long term financial objectives through investments in projects or acquisitions of existing businesses 
these investments could cause significant changes to the capital requirement estimates for nonregulated projects and property 
long term financing may be required for such investments 
nsp also will have future financing requirements for the portion of nuclear plant decommissioning costs not funded externally 
based on the most recent decommissioning study approved by regulators  these amounts are anticipated to be approximately million and are expected to be paid during the years to future sources of financing nsp expects to meet future financing requirements by periodically issuing long term debt  short term debt  common stock and preferred securities to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
over the long term  nsp s equity investments in and acquisitions of nonregulated projects are expected to be financed at the nonregulated subsidiary level from internally generated funds or the issuance of subsidiary debt 
financing requirements for the nonregulated projects  in excess of equity contributions from partners  are expected to be fulfilled through project or subsidiary debt 
decommissioning expenses not funded by an external trust are expected to be financed through a combination of internally generated funds  long term debt and common stock 
the extent of external financing to be required for nuclear decommissioning costs is unknown at this time 
the following summarizes the financing sources expected to be available to nsp in the near future internal funds internally generated funds from utility operations are expected to equal approximately percent of anticipated utility capital expenditures for and approximately percent of the billion in anticipated utility capital expenditures for the five year period because nrg has generally been reinvesting foreign cash flows in operations outside the united states  the equity income from foreign investments is not fully available to provide operating cash flows for domestic cash requirements such as payment of nsp dividends  domestic capital expenditures and domestic debt service 
through nrg  nsp is establishing a diverse portfolio of foreign energy projects with varying levels of cash flows  income and foreign taxation to allow maximum flexibility of foreign cash flows in the future 
short term debt nsp s board of directors has approved short term borrowing levels up to percent of capitalization 
nsp has received regulatory approval for up to million in short term borrowing levels and plans to keep its credit lines at or above its average level of commercial paper borrowings 
nsp credit lines as discussed in note to the financial statements make short term financing available in the form of bank loans  letters of credit and support for commercial paper for utility operations 
long term debt nsp minnesota s and nsp wisconsin s first mortgage indentures limit the amount of first mortgage bonds that may be issued 
the mpuc and the pscw have jurisdiction over securities issuance 
at dec 
  with an assumed interest rate of percent  nsp minnesota could have issued about billion of additional first mortgage bonds under its indenture and nsp wisconsin could have issued about million of additional first mortgage bonds under its indenture 
in november  nsp filed with the sec a million universal debt shelf registration 
nsp currently has million of registered  but unissued  bonds remaining from its million first mortgage bond shelf registration  which was filed in october depending on market conditions  nsp expects to issue the bonds to raise additional capital for general corporate purposes or to redeem or retire outstanding securities 
in  nrg anticipates issuing approximately million of corporate debt to finance several acquisitions that are expected to close during the year 
common stock nsp s articles of incorporation authorize an additional million shares of common stock in excess of shares issued at dec 
 in  nsp filed a registration statement with the sec to provide for the sale of up to million additional shares of new common stock under nsp s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase program drspp and executive long term incentive award stock plan 
nsp may issue new shares or purchase shares on the open market for its stock based plans 
see note to the financial statements for discussion of stock awards outstanding 
nsp plans to issue new shares for its drspp  employee stock ownership plan esop and executive long term incentive award stock plans in also  nsp may consider a general common stock offering in  depending on corporate needs and opportunities 
preferred stock nsp s articles of incorporation authorize the maximum amount of preferred stock that may be issued 
under these provisions  nsp could have issued all million of its remaining authorized  but unissued  preferred stock at dec 
  and remained in compliance with all interest and dividend coverage requirements
