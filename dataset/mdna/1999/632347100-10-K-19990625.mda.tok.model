this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in the company s marketplace for its company owned stores  which is principally the new york metropolitan area

year nathan s performed an internal evaluation of its computer systems and determined that its existing computer systems would require a significant amount of effort and cost in order to make them year compliant 
accordingly  in order to meet its growing business requirements and assure year compliance  nathan s decided to replace its existing accounting systems 
in july  nathan s entered into a contract to license lawson accounting software which has been certified to be year compliant 
nathan s successfully completed the conversion of its financial systems in january and the remaining aspects of the complete lawson implementation  were completed in june with the implementation of this new system  all of nathan s major financial systems should be year complaint  however  no assurance can be given in this regard 
nathan s estimates that the total cost associated with this effort to be approximately  and doesn t expect the final cost to vary materially  however  there can be no assurance to this effect

nathan s will be notifying its franchisees  in the next monthly franchise mailing  that they should contact their point of sale provider to be sure that they have received and installed the correction software mentioned above 
nathan s has received assurance from its financial institutions that their systems are or will be year compliant before the end of the year 
nathan s is also beginning to contact key suppliers and distributors about their state of readiness and will seek their assurances with respect to their year compliance and contingency plans 
no assurances can be given that such suppliers and distributors will in fact be year compliant 
nathan s believes that its primary year risk relating to its operations is centered upon the ability of its suppliers and distributors to continue to receive nathan s orders by telephone and have the product delivered by truck 
during the third quarter of  nathan s will conclude evaluating this year risk and will develop any necessary contingency plans to assure continued supply of products to its restaurants 
nathan s cannot predict the effect of the year problem on the vendors and others with which nathan s transacts business and there can be no assurance that the effect of the year problem on the entities nathan s does business with will not have a material adverse effect on nathan s business  operating results and financial position
