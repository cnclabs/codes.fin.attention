item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition management s discussion and analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding the company s results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years 
this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in tables through included with this discussion and analysis 
all per share amounts for periods prior to have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split distributed on september  to shareholders of record on august  mergers and acquisitions on november   first bank acquired a first union national bank branch located in lillington  north carolina 
deposits assumed totaled approximately  no loans were included in the purchase 
in the fourth quarter of  first bank completed its cash acquisition of the laurinburg and rockingham branch offices of first scotland bank 
assets acquired were approximately million including earning assets of approximately million  of which approximately million were loans 
deposit liabilities assumed were approximately million 
during the third quarter of  the company completed its cash acquisition of central state bank in high point  north carolina 
central state had approximately million in assets with earning assets of approximately million  including approximately million in loans 
central state also had approximately million in deposits 
for additional information on these acquisitions  please see analysis of results of operations and analysis of financial condition below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
analysis of results of operations net interest income  the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  constitutes the largest source of the company s earnings 
other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses  noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries  occupancy expense  equipment expense and other overhead costs  as well as the effects of income taxes 
overview compared to net income for was a record  a increase over the  earned in the net income amounted to per basic share  a increase over the basic earnings per share in earnings per share on a diluted basis amounted to in compared to in  an increase of 
results included  pretax in gains from commercial loan sales  which are not common from a historical perspective but are the type of gain that may occur again in the future under certain circumstances 
results included  pretax in nonrecurring income related to the receipt of an early termination fee for a data processing contract 
a primary contributor to the growth in earnings during was a increase in the company s net interest income 
this increase was a result of strong growth in loans and deposits 
partially offsetting the effects on earnings of the loan and deposit growth was a decrease in the company s net interest margin and a higher provision for loan losses 
the increase in the provision for loan losses from  in to  in was primarily attributable to the significant loan growth experienced by the company  and not because of concerns about the company s asset quality 
also contributing to the growth in earnings was a increase in the company s noninterest income  which grew from  in to  in  an increase of  core noninterest income  which the company defines as service charges on deposit accounts  commissions from insurance sales  fees from presold mortgages  and other service charges  commissions  and fees  increased  or  during  from  in to  in noninterest income not defined as core amounted to  and  during and  respectively  and is discussed in more detail below 
noninterest expenses increased  or  from  in to  in these higher operating expenses were experienced in all areas of the company s operations and are associated with the growth in the company s branch network and customer base 
overview compared to first bancorp s net income for amounted to  or basic earnings per share of  compared to  or basic earnings per share of  for this represents a increase in net income and basic earnings per share over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share amounted to in  a increase over the diluted earnings per share for excluding the after tax effects of nonrecurring gains of  or per share  in the fourth quarter of related to an early termination fee of a data processing contract and  or per share  in the third quarter of related to a branch sale  the increase in net income and basic earnings per share would have been over  and the increase in diluted earnings per share would have been 
the primary reason for the increase in net income in was a increase in net interest income that was a result of strong loan and deposit growth 
the provision for loan losses increased over the prior year  which is primarily a reflection of the company providing for the loan growth experienced during the year 
noninterest income decreased for the year and noninterest expenses increased for the year 
see additional discussion below 
net interest income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to  in   in  and  in table analyzes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
the company s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased by in and in these increases were primarily a result of a increase in average earning assets in and a increase in average earning assets during the effects of the increase in average earning assets on taxable equivalent net interest income in were partially offset by an overall narrowing of the company s interest rate spread 
the company s net interest margin net yield on average interest earning assets decreased basis points to in compared to in the company s interest rate spread the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points  from in to in a significant factor in this narrowing of the spread during was a decrease in the average rate the company earned on its loans 
in  the average interest rate the company earned on its loans decreased basis points  from in to in in addition to the effects of the average prime rate decreasing from in to in  other factors contributing to the decline in the loan yield were a highly competitive market and a continuing slight shift in the company s loan mix from riskier  but higher yielding  consumer installment loans  to less risky  but generally lower yielding  real estate loans see table and additional discussion below 
another significant factor contributing to the narrowing of the interest rate spread was a lower yield earned on taxable securities 
the yield the company earned on its taxable securities decreased basis points in to  compared to in this decline was primarily due to generally declining rates in the bond market that have occurred over the past few years  which has resulted in lower reinvestment yields of matured and called bonds 
despite the lower interest rate trend in the prime rate and bond market in  the average rate that the company paid on in its interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to 
the increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits was due primarily to the company more competitively pricing its deposits to fund the strong loan growth and a higher reliance on time deposits greater than  which generally carry higher interest rates 
average time deposits greater than  increased during compared to a increase for total average interest bearing liabilities 
in  the effects of the increase in average earning assets on taxable equivalent net interest income were enhanced by an increase in the company s interest rate spread by basis points  from in to in in the yield realized on earning assets increased by basis points from  while the average yield the company paid on interest bearing liabilities increased by only basis points  resulting in an increase in net interest margin of basis points to in from the yield realized in the increase in yield realized on earning assets was primarily affected by a basis point increase in the yield realized on loans that was largely a result of the basis point increase in the bank s prime lending rate that occurred in march and remained in effect for the remainder of the year 
the average rate paid on deposits  although basis points higher in compared to  was favorably impacted by higher growth in lower yielding savings  now  and money market deposits growth versus higher yielding time deposits growth 
changes in total interest income and total interest expense result from changes in both volumes and rates in the related earning asset and interest bearing liability categories 
table shows the quantitative effects on net interest income of the changes in volumes and rates experienced by the company 
as discussed above and illustrated in table  changes in volumes have been the primary cause of changes in the amounts of interest income and interest expense recorded by the company 
see additional information regarding net interest income on page in the section entitled interest rate risk provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on an evaluation of the portfolio  current economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other risk factors 
the company made provisions for loan losses of  in compared to  in and  in the increases in the provision for loan losses in both and were largely in response to a higher volume of loan growth experienced by the company over the prior year s growth  as the company s asset quality ratios improved during both years 
the company originated million in new loans  net of repayments  in compared to million in and million in see the section entitled allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with the bank s loan analysis and grading program  and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income recorded by the company amounted to  in   in  and  in the increase in noninterest income compared to was driven by a  or  increase in the amount of core noninterest income earned by the company 
core noninterest income  which includes service charges on deposit accounts  commissions from insurance sales  fees from presold mortgages  and other service charges  commissions  and fees increased from  in to  in the decrease in noninterest income from to was driven largely by a  decrease in core noninterest income 
noninterest income not defined as core amounted to  during   in  and  in see table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts increased  or  in after declining  or  in the increase was due to  but did not keep pace with  the growth rate of deposits 
management believes that service charges on deposit accounts have not increased at the same rate as deposits in the last two years primarily due to the mix of the company s deposit growth 
the number of transaction accounts  which includes demand  savings  and money market deposits and generates the majority of these fees  have not increased at the same rate as the growth in time deposits  which have fewer related fees 
additionally  the dollar increases that have occurred in the outstanding balance of transaction accounts have been more heavily concentrated in a fewer number of accounts with large balances 
another factor in the essentially flat two year deposit service charge growth relates to the bank s decision during to increase fees for certain services to make them more commensurate with the related expenses the bank incurred in providing the services 
also  an internal emphasis was placed on collecting the fees for all such services 
this initially had the effect of increasing gross service fee revenue which resulted in higher total service charge revenues in as compared to subsequently  management believes customers became more cognizant of the higher fees and made efforts to reduce their use of these services  which resulted in a decline in these same revenues for the bank during compared to commissions from insurance sales decreased by  in and  in as a result of lower commission fee rates negotiated with brokers  as well as a higher percentage of the company s customers utilizing their home equity lines of credit to finance consumer purchases versus obtaining consumer installment loans  where the company has typically brokered more insurance policies 
fees that the company earns from presold mortgage loans grew by  or during and have more than doubled since a lower interest rate environment conducive to mortgage loan refinancings and a dedicated staff of mortgage loan originators are primarily responsible for this significant increase 
other service charges  commissions  and fees increased by  or in after being almost flat comparing to the primary reason for the increase in this category of income was a surcharge that was levied on non customer atm transactions beginning in march these revenues amounted to  in  which is helping to defray the significant capital investment and maintenance expense incurred on atm machines 
the remainder of the increase in this category is largely due to increases in transaction related fee activities such as credit card merchant income  check cashing fees  and debit card income that were higher due to the growth in the company s customer base 
noninterest income not classified as core by the company in was primarily comprised of gains from commercial loan sales 
during  the company sold approximately million in newly originated commercial loans that resulted in gains of  these sales were executed primarily to maintain a proper balance between the amount of loans and deposits that the company maintains 
noninterest income not classified as core by the company in was primarily comprised of data processing fees totaling  and an early termination fee in the amount of  that montgomery data received from a bank that terminated its data processing contract with montgomery data prematurely 
as noted earlier  montgomery data makes its excess data processing capabilities available to area financial institutions for a fee 
montgomery data had one nonaffiliated customer in and for the first eleven months of  at which time the customer terminated its contract as a result of being acquired by another institution and paid the early termination fee 
montgomery data did not have any nonaffiliated customers from december to december in december  a contract was signed to provide data processing for a nearby start up bank 
this customer is expected to contribute approximately  in fees during montgomery data is not aggressively marketing this service and has no other prospective customers at this time 
noninterest income not classified as core by the company in was primarily comprised of  for data processing fees related to the nonaffiliated customer noted above and a net gain of  that the company realized from a sale of a branch premises and its related deposits 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses for were  a increase over the  recorded in the amount was higher than the  incurred in the increases in noninterest expenses in the past two years occurred in almost all categories and were due primarily to the company s growth 
the company incurred higher expenses in order to properly process  manage  and service the increase in loans and increase in deposits that have occurred over the past two years 
in addition  the company s branch network grew from to branches from january  through december the wagram office was consolidated with the laurinburg office on december  resulting in remaining branches 
personnel expense  the single largest component of noninterest expense  increased during and during these increases were primarily due to additional employees associated with the company s growth  as well as normal annual wage increases 
the total number of employees of the company increased in and in the company has announced plans to open a new branch in angier  nc  in the first quarter of in addition  the company has announced plans to close two branches by consolidating them with other branches in the same towns 
the effects of the net reduction in branches by one is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s overall noninterest expense 
table presents the components of the company s noninterest expense during the past three years 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was  in   in  and  in the increase in tax expense in compared to is a result of a increase in pretax income  as well as an increase in the company s effective tax rate from in to in the increase in the company s effective tax rate occurred as a result of the company deriving a smaller percentage of its earnings from tax exempt securities 
the increase in taxes when comparing to was due entirely to the company s increase in pretax income  as the company s effective tax rate remained constant 
table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates 
analysis of financial condition and changes in financial condition the following discussion focuses on the factors considered by management to be important in assessing the company s financial condition 
the company s assets and deposits continued strong growth rates that began in  reflecting growth in existing markets and expansion into new geographic areas 
as previously noted  over the past two years  the company s loans have grown by and deposits have grown by 
total assets were million at december   an increase of over december  assets during grew to million at year end  a increase over the million at december  interest earning assets amounted to million at december   a increase over the amount at december  interest earning assets at december  were million  an increase of over the million held at december  loans  the primary interest earning asset  grew in and in  with a total of million at december  funding the and asset growth were increases in deposits 
deposits increased  or million  during  amounting to million at year end 
in  deposits grew  or million  to million at year end 
approximately million of the asset and deposit growth can be attributed to a fourth quarter purchase of a first union national bank branch located in lillington  nc the company s assets and deposits have experienced compound annual growth rates of approximately over the last five years 
distribution of assets and liabilities table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of the company s balance sheets at december    and the most significant variance in this table is the shift in asset mix over the past two years from securities to loans that is primarily due to strong loan growth that was partially funded with proceeds from securities maturities and sales 
securities information regarding the company s securities portfolio as of december    and is presented in tables and total securities available for sale and held to maturity amounted to million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
the increase in securities at december  compared to december  is largely due to the company purchasing approximately million in securities during the fourth quarter of until the fourth quarter of  because of the relatively flat yield curve  the company maintained its excess cash in overnight investments 
with the steepening of the yield curve that occurred with the three successive basis point rate cuts by the federal reserve beginning in early october  management of the company purchased securities to realize the higher yield that could be obtained from securities versus overnight investments 
the decrease in year end securities at december  as compared to was due to the company investing more funds in overnight cash investments at year end to fund the strong loan demand experienced by the company near year end  as well as the lack of yield incentive to invest in securities with maturities longer than overnight due to the flattening of the yield curve that occurred near that time 
average total securities were approximately million during compared to million during and million in the lower average balance in securities during was due to the company holding more cash in overnight investments versus investing in securities for most of the year for the reasons discussed above 
the increase in the average balance of securities during was due to a higher level of funds provided by the slightly higher growth in the amount of average deposits during the year versus average loans  as well as funds provided by earnings of the company 
the composition of the securities portfolios at december    and reflects a shift in and from us treasuries and government agencies to higher yielding mortgage backed securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations 
included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  included in mortgage backed securities at december  were collateralized mortgage obligations with an amortized cost of  and a fair value of  at december   net unrealized gains of  were included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale compared to net unrealized gains of  at december  and  at december  management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
net unrealized gains  net of applicable deferred income taxes  of   and  have been reported as a separate component of shareholders equity as of december    and  respectively 
the fair value of securities held to maturity  which the company carries at amortized cost  exceeded their carrying value by  at december    at december   and  in management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates  not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations 
table provides detail as to scheduled contractual maturities and book yields on securities available for sale and securities held to maturity at december  mortgage backed securities are shown in the time periods consistent with their estimated life based on expected prepayment speeds 
approximately of the available for sale portfolio has a maturity date within years 
the weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the maturity date for non mortgage backed securities  and the expected life for mortgage backed securities was years 
if above market callable bonds are assumed to be called at their call date  the average expected life of the available for sale portfolio drops to years 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was at december  the weighted average life of the securities held to maturity portfolio based on maturity dates was years at december  with a weighted average taxable equivalent yield of 
if above market callable bonds are assumed to be called on their call date  the weighted average maturity of the held to maturity portfolio drops to years 
as of december  and  the company held no investment securities of any one issuer  other than us treasury and us government agencies or corporations  in which aggregate book values and market values exceeded of shareholders equity 
other than the collateralized mortgage obligations previously discussed  the company owned no securities considered by regulatory authorities to be derivative instruments 
loans table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition at each of the past five year ends 
loans increased by million  or  in to million from the million held at december  the year end amount was million  or  higher than the million balance at december  the majority of the loan growth occurred in loans secured by real estate  with approximately million  or  of the net loan growth occurring in real estate mortgage or real estate construction loans 
in  real estate mortgage loans grew  real estate construction loans grew  commercial  financial  and agricultural cf a loans grew  and installment loans to individuals grew 
for four out of the past five years  cf a loans have comprised a lower percentage of the loan portfolio  and for five straight years  installment loans to individuals have decreased in relation to the overall portfolio 
this shift from non real estate to real estate loans has been partially due to a strategic shift towards higher dollar loans  which tend to be secured by real estate in most cases  in order to more quickly leverage the bank s balance sheet and extensive branch network 
as noted earlier  the shift to a higher percentage of real estate loans has contributed to the decrease in the bank s loan yields and net interest margin  as real estate loans generally carry lower interest rates than non real estate loans 
the loan growth in was also concentrated in real estate loans  with real estate loans comprising of the new loan growth 
in  real estate mortgage loans grew  real estate construction loans grew  cf a loans grew  and installment loans to individuals grew 
a large portion of the company s loan portfolio has historically been comprised of loans secured by various types of real estate 
at december   million or of the company s loan portfolio was secured by liens on real property 
included in this total are million  or of total loans  in credit secured by liens on family residential properties and million  or of total loans  in credit secured by liens on other types of real estate 
table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods  with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately 
approximately of the bank s loans outstanding at december  mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years 
these percentages are approximately the same as they were at december  the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans to total performing loans were and as of december  compared to and  respectively  as of december  the bank intentionally makes a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk 
the yield on performing loans as of december  was compared to at december  and at december  the decrease in the yield at december  is primarily due to a basis point lower prime rate when compared to a year earlier 
the slight increase in yield at december  was primarily a result of a higher prime rate in effect at year end 
both years were affected by the company s general trend  beginning in the second half of  of originating larger balance real estate loans with slightly lower yields 
see additional information regarding interest rate risk on page in the section entitled interest rate risk 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest  restructured loans and foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties 
as a matter of policy the company places all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis  and thus there were no such loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest 
table summarizes the company s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful 
the placing of loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or is charged off  ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes highly probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off  if appropriate  may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms 
nonperforming loans which includes nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and totaled   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to   and  at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in nonperforming loans from to is primarily due to improved overall loan quality  as well as the pay out of a  loan in the first quarter of that was on nonaccrual status at december  the decrease in nonperforming loans at december  as compared to december  is primarily attributable to the resolution of several relationships that resulted in partial charge offs during the year  as well as generally improved loan quality 
the increase in nonperforming loans at december  compared to december  was largely due to  more in loans on nonaccrual status that were assumed in corporate acquisitions occurring in and these nonaccrual loans that were originated by other institutions amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  as of december   the largest nonaccrual balance to any one borrower was  with the average balance for the nonaccrual loans being approximately  if the nonaccrual loans and restructured loans as of december   and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period  gross interest income in the amounts of approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans and   and  for restructured loans would have been recorded for  and  respectively 
interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in  and amounted to approximately   and  for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and   and  for restructured loans  respectively 
in addition to the nonperforming loan amounts included above  management believes that an estimated  of loans that are currently performing in accordance with their contractual terms may potentially develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general 
management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at december  see discussion below 
loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful  substandard  or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties have changed only slightly in total amount over the past two years  amounting to  at december  compared to  at december   and  at december  foreclosed  repossessed  and idled properties represented   and of total assets at the end of   and  respectively 
the company s management has reviewed recent appraisals of these properties and believes that their fair values  less estimated costs to sell  exceed the respective carrying values at the dates presented 
allowance for loan losses and loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
the recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of possible future losses and current economic conditions 
the bank uses a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate its evaluation of possible future loan losses and the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are assigned by management and tested by the bank s internal audit department and an independent third party consulting firm 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  loans that management identifies as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations 
the company strives to maintain its loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of the company s market areas 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
the company has no foreign loans  few agricultural loans and does not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries 
the majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are primarily various personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan 
collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within the company s principal market area 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to  at december  compared to  as of december  and  at december  this represented   and  of loans outstanding as of december    and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans has been gradually decreasing since its high of at september  the september  high of was an increase from the ratio at june  due primarily to an addition to the allowance of million that was recorded in the third quarter of in connection with a corporate acquisition in which a higher risk loan portfolio was acquired 
the general decrease in the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans since then has been largely due to charge offs associated with that portfolio  strong recent loan growth  as well as generally improved overall loan quality 
as noted in table  the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans amounted to at december  compared to at december  and at december  table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
the portion of these reserves that was allocated to specific loan types in the loan portfolio increased from  at december  to  at december  this increase was due to growth in the company s loan portfolio  as the company reserves a minimum percentage for all loans outstanding 
the allocated allowance decreased in to  from  at december  this decrease was due to significant improvement in the company s loan quality  which was partially offset by the effects of the minimum reserve percentage on the company s high loan growth 
in addition to the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  the company maintains an unallocated portion that is not assigned to any specific category of loans  but rather is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the overall portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
the general increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses has been consistent with overall loan growth 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover possible loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date 
it must by emphasized  however  that the determination of the allowance using the company s procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about future economic conditions and other factors affecting loans 
no assurance can be given that the company will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of conditions and factors then prevailing  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowances based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
for the years indicated  table summarizes the company s balances of loans outstanding  average loans outstanding  changes in the allowance arising from charge offs and recoveries by category  and additions to the allowance that have been charged to expense 
the company s net loan charge offs were approximately  in   in  and  in this represents   and of average loans during   and  respectively 
in the current economic environment  the company generally projects annual net charge offs to average loans of approximately to 
for the year ended  several large recoveries were primarily responsible for the low net charge off percentage 
for  unusually low gross charge offs of  were primarily responsible for the low net charge off percentage of 
charge offs in included approximately  of loans related to the parties involved in a litigation matter that was settled on december  deposits the average amounts of deposits of the company for the years ended december   and are presented in table average deposits grew million  or  during to million 
average deposits for grew by over the average to million 
the million in growth in the two time deposit categories accounted for of the growth  with average time deposits greater than  increasing by million  or  during the year and average other time deposits growing by million  or 
the increase in time deposits during was due to expansion of the company s customer base  as well as the company more competitively pricing time deposits in order to help fund the strong loan growth 
despite the slightly lower interest rate environment during  this more competitive pricing increased the average rate that the company paid on time deposits greater than  from in to in  and increased the average rate that the company paid on other time deposits from in to in while time deposits experienced the highest growth rates  the growth rates of the other deposit categories were also strong  with average interest bearing demand deposits growing by  average savings deposits growing by  and average non interest bearing deposits growing by 
the four basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits in can be attributed to reductions in the rates that the company paid on these accounts that were made when the prime and federal funds rates were decreased in the last quarter of the year 
the five basis point increase in the average rate paid on savings deposits is largely a result of most of the growth in this category occurring in the company s higher yielding preferred savings sweep account 
the category of deposits with the largest percentage increase during was interest bearing demand deposits  which increased by 
this increase can be partially attributed to the company restructuring several of its accounts within this category to offer more competitive rates 
this resulted in a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing demand deposits for the year 
for  average savings deposits increased by  average time deposits increased by  and average noninterest bearing deposits grew by  over the averages from the company has a large  stable base of time deposits with little dependence on volatile public deposits of  or more 
the time deposits are principally certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts obtained from individual customers 
deposits of certain local governments and municipal entities represented of the bank s total deposits at december  all such public funds are collateralized by investment securities 
the company does not purchase brokered deposits 
as of december   the company held approximately  in time deposits of  or more and other time deposits of  table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more as of december  this table shows that of the company s time deposits greater than  mature within one year 
interest rate risk including quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
net interest income is the company s most significant component of earnings 
notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits  the company s level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to the various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it is the company s policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection  to the extent practical  against wide interest rate fluctuations 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard gap reports  maturity reports  and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates  expected future interest rates  and various intervals of shock interest rates 
over the years  the company has been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin 
over the past ten years the net interest margin has not varied in any single year by more than the basis point change experienced by the company in  and the lowest net interest margin realized over that same period is within basis points of the highest 
prior to  the most that the company s net interest margin varied from one year to the next was basis points 
the company reported a net interest margin of in the fourth quarter of compared to in the third quarter of  in the second quarter of and in the first quarter of management believes  that assuming a relatively static interest rate environment  the net interest margin should stabilize 
at the end of the third quarter of  when changes in the prime rate began to occur  the company s interest sensitivity position was similar to that at december  as illustrated in table table illustrates that the company is more liability sensitive in the over to month horizon than in the months or less horizon 
as the effects of the fourth quarter drop in the prime rate continue to manifest  the company expects to have more liabilities repricing at the lower prime adjusted rate than assets 
the positive effects on net interest income of this scenario are likely to be offset by continued competitive pricing pressures  as well as securities that are expected to be called 
while the company can not guarantee stability in the net interest margin in the future  at this time  management does not expect significant fluctuations 
see additional discussion of the company s net interest margin in the net interest income section above 
table sets forth the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december   using stated maturities for all instruments except mortgage backed securities which are shown as a lump sum in the period consistent with their weighted average estimated life 
as illustrated by this table  the company has million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets this amount is reduced by approximately million if above rate callable bonds are assumed to be called on their call date 
this generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment 
however  this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings  market value  or management actions 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice  market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products 
for example  included in interest bearing liabilities at december  subject to interest rate changes within one year are deposits totaling million comprised of now  savings  and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management 
these types of deposits historically have not repriced coincidentally with or in the same proportion as general market indicators 
thus  the company believes that near term net interest income would not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates 
similarly  management would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates 
as of december   approximately of interest earning assets could be repriced within five years and substantially all interest bearing liabilities could be repriced within five years 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes  nor does it maintain any foreign currency positions 
table presents the expected maturities of the company s other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments 
table also presents the fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the company s fixed rate earning assets have estimated fair values that are slightly higher than their carrying value 
this is due to the yields on these portfolios being slightly higher than market yields at december  for instruments with maturities similar to the remaining term of the portfolios due to a generally declining interest rate environment at year end 
the estimated fair value of the company s time deposits is higher than its book value for the same reason 
off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
these commitments are not recorded as an asset or liability until exercised 
as of december   the company had outstanding loan commitments of  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
included in outstanding loan commitments were unfunded commitments of  on revolving credit plans  of which  were at variable rates and  were at fixed rates 
additionally  standby letters of credit of approximately  and  were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the company s exposure to credit loss for the aforementioned commitments in the event of nonperformance by the party to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above 
however  management believes that these commitments represent no more than the normal lending risk that the company commits to its borrowers 
if these commitments are drawn  the company plans to obtain collateral if it is deemed necessary based on management s credit evaluation of the counter party 
the types of collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory and commercial or residential real estate 
management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations 
derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  options contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
the company does not engage in derivatives activities 
return on assets and equity table shows return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average shareholders equity  dividend payout ratio dividends declared per share divided by net income per share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended december  liquidity the company s liquidity is determined by its ability to convert assets to cash or acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of its customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds  and to maintain required reserve levels  pay expenses and operate the company on an ongoing basis 
the company s primary liquidity sources are net income from operations  cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the company s securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash 
in addition  the bank has the ability  on a short term basis  to purchase million in federal funds from other financial institutions and has a million line of credit with the federal home loan bank the fhlb in place that can provide short or long term financing 
the company has not historically had to rely on these sources of credit as a source of liquidity 
the company has experienced an increase in its loan to deposit ratio over the past two years  from at december  to at december  to at december   as a result of the significant loan growth experienced 
this strong loan growth has reduced the company s liquidity sources 
to further enhance available liquidity sources  during the company increased its available line of credit with the fhlb from million to million 
beginning in the third quarter of  although the company did not have any liquidity or funding difficulties  the company began making periodic draws and repayments on this line of credit on an overnight basis to maintain liquidity ratios at internally targeted levels 
at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings totaling million  while the average amount outstanding for the year was million 
the company s management believes its liquidity sources are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet its operating needs 
capital resources the company is regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve board frb and is subject to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the bank is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the north carolina state banking commission 
the company is not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
the company and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the frb and fdic 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on both the company s and the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
these capital standards require the company to maintain minimum ratios of tier capital to total risk weighted assets and total capital to risk weighted assets of and  respectively 
tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles less intangible assets  and total capital is comprised of tier capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the company is the allowance for loan losses 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the company adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in frb and fdic regulations 
in addition to the risk based capital requirements described above  the company is subject to a leverage capital requirement  which calls for a minimum ratio of tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets of to  depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators 
the frb has not advised the company of any requirement specifically applicable to it 
in addition to the minimum capital requirements described above  the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for classification as well capitalized  which are presented with the minimum ratios and the company s ratios at december   and in table at december   and  the company was in compliance with all existing capital requirements 
although the company continues to exceed even the regulatory thresholds for well capitalized status  the company s capital ratios have been steadily declining with the strong growth the company has experienced 
the company s total risk based capital to tier ii risk adjusted assets ratio of at december   compared to the well capitalized threshold of  is the only one of the three regulatory ratios that is within basis points of falling below the well capitalized threshold 
the company has plans in place to correct any ratio that falls below the well capitalized threshold 
see supervision and regulation under business above and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect the company s capital resources 
year issue the company recognizes and is addressing the potentially severe implications of the year issue 
the year issue also known as yk is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations as the year approaches 
this issue is caused by the fact that many of the world s existing computer programs use only two digits to identify the year in the date field of a program 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century and could experience serious malfunctions when the last two digits of the year change to as a result of identifying a year designated as the year rather than the year this misidentification could prevent the company from being able to engage in normal business operations  including  among other things  miscalculating interest accruals and the inability to process customer transactions 
because of the potentially serious ramifications of the year issue  the company is taking the year issue very seriously 
the company s technology committee  which is comprised of a cross section of the company s employees  is leading the company s year efforts and involving all employees of the company in ensuring that the company is properly prepared for the year the company s board of directors has approved a plan submitted by the technology committee that was developed in accordance with guidelines set forth by the federal financial institutions examination council 
this plan has three primary phases related to internal year compliance 
the first phase of the company s efforts to address the year issue was to inventory all known company processes that could reasonably be expected to be impacted by the year issue and their related vendors  if applicable 
this inventory of processes and vendors included not only typical computer processes such as the company s transaction applications systems  but all known processes that could be impacted by micro chip malfunctions 
these include but are not limited to the company s alarm system  phone system  check ordering process  and atm network 
this phase is complete  although it is periodically updated as necessary 
the company s second phase in addressing the year issue was to contact all third party vendors  request documentation regarding their year compliance efforts  and analyze the responses 
this was a significant phase because the company does not perform in house programming  and thus is dependent on external vendors to ensure and modify  if necessary  the hardware  software  or service they provide to the company to be year compliant 
this phase is now virtually complete and the company is currently following up on any issues or concerns identified in the responses received  as necessary 
the next phase for the company under the plan is to complete a comprehensive testing of all known processes 
under the plan  processes are initially to be tested on a stand alone basis and then they are to be tested on an integrated basis with other processes 
testing of the company s processes on a stand alone basis is substantially complete 
testing on a integrated basis is scheduled to be complete by may  management plans for any corrective actions to be implemented to ensure that the company is fully prepared for the year by the end of the second quarter of the most significant phase of testing is the testing of the company s core software applications 
upgrades of the core software applications currently used by the company were received from the software vendor in june and were represented to be year compliant by the vendor 
these applications were successfully loaded onto the company s hardware system in july and year testing began in september the testing of the core applications on a stand alone basis revealed no problems and none are expected to be encountered during the integrated testing 
another part of the company s year plan is to assess the year readiness of its significant borrowers and depositors 
through the use of questionnaires and personal contacts  the company has gathered information regarding the year readiness of significant borrowers and depositors of the company 
the assessment of the company s significant depositors is complete 
the assessment of the company s significant borrowers is currently in process and is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of customers who the company has year concerns about are being counseled on the year issue  urged to take action  and placed on an internal watch list that will be updated on a quarterly basis and reviewed and monitored by the company for any potential effects on the company 
based on the evaluation to date  management of the company does not believe that the number or magnitude of customers with potential year problems will be significant 
prospective new loan customers are also assessed for year compliance as a part of the underwriting process of significant loans 
management is also working closely with outside consultants and the fdic on the company s year readiness 
in the company s form k  the company disclosed an estimated range of total costs to address the year issue to be from  to  during the second quarter of  management believed that the estimated cost to modify the company s automated teller machines atms would likely be higher than originally projected 
as a result  the company projected the total costs to address the year issue to be from  to  in the fourth quarter of  the company s year testing of its existing atms was successful  and now the company does not believe that there will be any significant year costs associated with the company s atms 
based on an evaluation of the company s current year status  it is now management s belief that total year costs will be approximately  which are being expensed as they occur 
in and to date  the company expensed approximately  in year issue related costs 
the majority of the remainder of the year issue costs are expected to occur in the first half of the estimated and actual year costs include only direct external costs associated with year readiness  and do not include any amounts attributable to the significant time that management and the staff of the company has spent planning  preparing and testing for year readiness 
although funding of the year project costs will come from normal operating cash flow  the external expenses associated with the year issue will directly reduce otherwise reported net income for the company 
management of the company believes that the potential effects on the company s internal operations of the year issue can and will be addressed prior to the year however  if required modifications or conversions are not made or are not completed on a timely basis prior to the year  the year issue could disrupt normal business operations 
the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios foreseeable at this time would include the company temporarily not being able to process  in some combination  various types of customer transactions 
this could affect the ability of the company to  among other things  originate new loans  post loan payments  accept deposits or allow immediate withdrawals  and  depending on the amount of time such a scenario lasted  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
because of the serious implications of these scenarios  the primary emphasis of the company s year efforts is to correct  with complete replacement if necessary  any systems or processes whose year test results are not satisfactory prior to the year nevertheless  should one of the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios occur in the year  the company is currently refining a contingency plan that would allow for limited transactions  including the ability to make certain deposit withdrawals  until the year problems are remediated 
the costs of the year project and the date on which the company plans to complete year compliance are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events such as the availability of certain resources including internal and external resources  third party vendor plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved at the cost disclosed or within the time frame indicated  and actual results could differ materially from these plans 
factors that might affect the timely and efficient completion of the company s year project include  but are not limited to  vendors abilities to adequately correct or convert software and the effect on the company s ability to test its systems  the availability and cost of personnel trained in the year area  the ability to identify and correct all relevant computer programs and similar uncertainties 
inflation since the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts  the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation 
interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases  but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same 
the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories 
during periods of high inflation  there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply  and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets  loans and deposits 
also  general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses 
accounting changes the company prepares its financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by  among others  the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic  the fasb frequently issues new rules and proposed new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities 
during  the company adopted three new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information and sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
none of the three standards adopted in changed the way company measures its assets  liabilities  income or expense 
the three standards adopted in are discussed below 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements 
comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period for non owner transactions and is divided into net income and other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income includes revenues  expenses  gains  and losses that are excluded from earnings under current accounting standards 
this statement does not change or modify the reporting or display in the income statement 
sfas no 
was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  comparative financial statements for earlier periods have been presented to reflect the application of this statement 
the fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the statement requires management to report selected financial and descriptive information about reportable operating segments 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
generally  disclosures are required for segments internally identified to evaluate performance and resource allocation 
sfas no 
was effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  in all material respects  the company s operations are entirely within the commercial banking segment  and the information presented herein reflects the results of that segment 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement standardized the disclosure requirements of pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement did not change any measurement or recognition provisions  and thus did not materially impact the company 
the company has two defined benefit plans that were subject to the disclosures required by this statement 
see the required disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board has also issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  because the company has not historically and does not currently employ the use of derivatives  this statement is not expected to impact the company 
in  the company adopted sfas no 
 earnings per share  which affected the way the company measured and presented its earnings per share information 
the company adopted sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas no 
as of december  sfas no 
superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 earnings per share apb no 
which the company had followed until the adoption of sfas no 
for companies that have potentially issuable stock complex capital structures  such as first bancorp with its stock option plan  sfas no 
requires that two earnings per share amounts be disclosed basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share is computed by assuming the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period 
currently  the company s only dilutive potential common stock issuances relate to options that have been issued under the company s stock option plan see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the stock option plan 
in computing diluted earnings per share  it is assumed that all such dilutive stock options are exercised during the reporting period at their respective exercise prices  with the proceeds from the exercises used by the company to buy back stock in the open market at the average market price in effect during the reporting period 
the difference between the number of shares assumed to be exercised and the number of shares bought back is added to the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period 
the sum is used as the denominator to calculate diluted earnings per share for the company 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion may contain statements that could be deemed forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act  which statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are statements that include projections  predictions  expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact 
such statements are often characterized by the use of qualifying words and their derivatives such as expect  believe  estimate  plan  project  or other statements concerning opinions or judgment of the company and its management about future events 
factors that could influence the accuracy of such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the financial success or changing strategies of the company s customers  actions of government regulators  the level of market interest rates  and general economic conditions
