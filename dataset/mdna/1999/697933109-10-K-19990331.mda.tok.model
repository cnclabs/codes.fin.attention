item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the pro forma financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
results of operations the company s results of operations as reported incorporate panamsat international s activity commencing may   the effective date of the merger 
since this represents only seven and one half months of activity for panamsat international in  management has determined that for comparative purposes  it would be more meaningful to present the information shown below on a pro forma basis reflecting the merger as though it had occurred at the beginning of the respective periods presented excluding the impact of panamsat international s million gain on the sale of its direct to home television rights in certain foreign markets to an affiliate concurrent with the merger  as well as certain professional and advisory fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the merger totaling million  both of which are nonrecurring items that are not indicative of the company s ordinary course of business 
the pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the combined results that would have occurred had the merger actually occurred at the beginning of pro forma as reported unaudited year year year year year ended ended ended ended ended in thousands  except per share data revenues operating leases  satel lite services and oth er      outright sales and sales type leases      total revenue      costs and expenses cost of outright sales and sales type leases

pro forma results for and as reported results since the merger date reflect the impact of the acquisition of panamsat international  including the use of purchase accounting 
comparisons of as reported results reflect significant increases in amortization of intangible assets  interest expense  the effective income tax rate and shares outstanding arising from the merger 
revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in video services revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the same pro forma period in the decrease was primarily due to less sales and sales type lease activity as compared to the same pro forma period in telecommunications services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of from the same pro forma period in the increase was due primarily to the growth in data and internet related service agreements 
revenue results can also be analyzed based on the type of agreement 
revenues from sales and sales type leases decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease is attributable to a lower volume in relative to of outright sales and sales type leases 
revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the increase was primarily due to the commencement of commercial service on two new satellites  pas and galaxy viii i  which were launched in the latter part of and generated a full year of operating lease revenues in as reported revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the impact of the merger  and also due to increased service agreements associated with available transponder capacity 
cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders 
the company recorded no cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same pro forma period in the pro forma cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders for the year ended december  are related to several outright sales and sales type leases executed during that period 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the exercise by the company of early buy out opportunities on sale leaseback agreements during direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same pro forma period in the increase primarily was due to direct costs associated with additional satellites placed in service and operating costs associated with the normal growth of the company attributable to the growth in the size of the satellite fleet 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in  due primarily to depreciation expense associated with additional satellites placed in service 
as reported depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in  from million in in addition to the impact of the merger  the increase was a result of depreciation expense associated with additional transponder capacity placed in service 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was primarily due to increased depreciation and direct operating costs associated with the company s expanded satellite fleet  offset by increased revenue generated by the expanded satellite fleet 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in the increase was due primarily to higher average borrowing levels during as well as less interest income earned as a result of the company s smaller investment portfolio and a lower amount of capitalized interest cost for the satellites under construction resulting from the lower borrowing rate in income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was due to the decrease in income before income taxes as well as to a lower effective tax rate in principally as a result of utilization of foreign sales corporation tax benefits 
minority interest 
minority interest  representing preferred stock dividends of panamsat international  were for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same pro forma period in the decrease was due to the conversion of panamsat international s mandatorily exchangeable senior redeemable preferred stock due into senior subordinated notes due in the third quarter of and the related termination of dividend payment obligations 
approximately of the senior subordinated notes were subsequently retired in connection with the tender offer and restructuring program described above 
extraordinary item 
the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million million before taxes during related to the early extinguishment of certain indebtedness of panamsat s subsidiaries 
the charge principally represented the excess of the price paid for the debt over its carrying value  net of any deferred financing costs and fair value adjustments recognized in connection with the merger 
compared to pro forma and as reported the following discussion of versus performance is primarily based on pro forma results 
pro forma results for and and as reported results since the merger date reflect the impact of the acquisition of panamsat international  including the use of purchase accounting 
comparisons of as reported results reflect significant increases in amortization of intangible assets  interest expense  the effective income tax rate and shares outstanding arising from the merger 
revenues 
pro forma revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in pro forma video services revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  principally as a result of increased service agreements associated with available transponder capacity  increased ad hoc revenue associated with significant international news events and increased revenues associated with dth services 
pro forma telecommunications services revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to less outright sales and sales type lease activity during pro forma satellite services and other revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in principally due to a decrease in ground services sales 
the pro forma revenue increase can also be analyzed based on the type of agreement 
pro forma revenues from sales and sales type leases decreased to million in from million in the decrease was attributable to a lower volume in relative to of outright sales and sales type leases 
pro forma revenues from operating leases of transponders  satellite services and other increased million  or  to million in from million in  due primarily to additional transponder capacity placed in service 
as reported revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the impact of the merger  and also due to increased service agreements associated with available transponder capacity 
cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders 
pro forma cost of outright sales and sales type leases of transponders decreased million  or  to million in from million in  due to the decrease in outright sales and sales type leases 
leaseback expense  net of deferred gain 
pro forma leaseback expense  net of deferred gain  increased million  or  to million in from million in direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs 
pro forma direct operating and selling  general and administrative costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in depreciation and amortization 
pro forma depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in  from million in  due primarily to depreciation expense associated with additional transponder capacity placed in service 
as reported depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in  from million in in addition to the impact of the merger  the increase was a result of depreciation expense associated with additional transponder capacity placed in service 
income from operations 
pro forma income from operations increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues and the decrease in cost of outright sales and sales type leases 
interest expense  net 
pro forma interest expense  net decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease in pro forma interest expense  net was due to increased interest income earned on marketable securities coupled with reduced interest expense reflecting larger amounts of interest capitalized on satellites under construction which are expected to be launched in and income tax expense 
pro forma income tax expense increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in pro forma income tax expense was principally due to the increase in taxable income 
the pro forma tax rates for and of and  respectively  are higher than the statutory rate due to the fact that goodwill amortization attributable to the merger is not deductible for tax purposes 
minority interest 
pro forma minority interest  representing preferred stock dividends of panamsat international  decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was due to the conversion of panamsat international s mandatorily exchangeable senior redeemable preferred stock due into senior subordinated notes due in the third quarter of and the related termination of dividend payment obligations 
extraordinary item 
the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million million before taxes during related to the early extinguishment of certain indebtedness of panamsat s subsidiaries 
the charge principally represented the excess of the price paid for the debt over its carrying value  net of any deferred financing costs and fair value adjustments recognized in connection with the merger 
spacecraft developments pas and pas were launched during the second half of and cover the ior and por  respectively 
pas b was launched during the fourth quarter of and is located in the aor 
as a result of technical problems that occurred on certain of the company s satellites in the last months  the company has modified its previously announced expansion and restoration strategy to support its existing fleet and customers and provide additional capacity 
the following recent technical events have affected panamsat s satellite fleet following the launch of pas in late  an anomaly was detected in its solar arrays 
the satellite experienced several circuit failures in its solar arrays and may experience additional failures in the future 
the circuit failures require the company to forego the use of some transponders initially and to turn off additional transponders in later years 
the company submitted an insurance claim for this partial loss and million was received during the ability of transponders to provide transmission power for dth signal reception using centimeter dishes is not affected 
during  three of the company s satellites experienced what is believed to be a related anomaly in their on board scps 
on may   all customer services on galaxy iv were permanently lost when the satellite experienced an scp failure that caused the satellite to rotate and lose its fixed orientation with the earth 
the spare scp was unavailable due to an earlier unrelated event that had not been previously detected 
the company submitted an insurance claim for this loss and received million in for non pre emptable customers  service was restored with the use of capacity on other company satellites  including capacity previously used by certain customers whose service was subject to preemption and terminated in accordance with their agreements 
subsequently  two other satellites galaxy vii and pas had primary scp failures but are operating normally on back up systems 
an investigation of the anomaly  conducted by hsc  the manufacturer of the three affected satellites  identified electrical short circuits involving tin plated relay switches as the most probable cause of the scp failures 
the report concluded that the short circuits can occur only when several factors are concurrently present 
of the satellites owned by panamsat that were constructed by hsc  five satellites including pas and galaxy vii are the same model spacecraft as the affected satellites  and have tin plated relay switches similar to the switches on the failed scps 
no assurance can be given that additional scp failures will not occur 
on august   the company s galaxy x satellite was destroyed during the inaugural launch of the boeing delta iii rocket which exploded shortly after liftoff 
the company plans to launch a replacement for galaxy x  galaxy x r  by the fourth quarter of the company received million in insurance proceeds as a result of the failure 
in march  two cells failed in the battery system of pas the batteries sole purpose is to power the payload and spacecraft operations during the daily eclipse periods having a duration of one minute to a maximum of minutes per day which occur during two day periods around each of march and september during the autumn eclipse season in  additional full and partial cell failures occurred on the satellite 
in future eclipse seasons  service to one or more existing full time customers may be interrupted for brief periods which  depending upon their extent  could result in a claim by affected customers for termination of their agreements 
the company intends to submit an insurance claim for this partial loss 
the company intends to use pas  an international satellite scheduled for launch in january  to migrate its largest ku band customer from pas this will result in fewer transponders being utilized on a full time basis on pas the company believes that this will reduce the likelihood that full time c band customers on pas will experience service interruptions during upcoming eclipse seasons  although there can be no assurance that additional battery cell failures will not occur in the future 
also in the autumn eclipse season of  a battery problem similar to the pas anomaly was detected on galaxy viii i  which is the same model satellite as pas the incident resulted in the shut off of a substantial number of transponders for brief periods during the eclipses 
the company intends to submit an insurance claim for this loss 
there can be no assurance that additional battery cell failures will not occur in future eclipse seasons 
the company plans to monitor the battery cells on pas and galaxy viii i during future eclipse seasons to determine whether the condition has stabilized 
following the launch of the company s pas satellite  an error of the satellite s manufacturer was discovered that affected the geographical coverage or flexibility of all of the ku band transponders on the satellite 
the impact of the error is being evaluated by the company  and it is currently believed that certain of the transponders will not be marketable for their intended purpose  although the affected transponders may be capable of generating revenue at a reduced rate 
the power of the transponders is not affected 
the company anticipates making an insurance claim for its losses 
the c band beams have not been affected by the error 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s satellite deployment plan has been modified to serve as an expansion  restoration and back up plan 
satellite deployment plan panamsat s satellite deployment plan is intended to enable the company to provide back up and replacement capacity as well as expanded satellite services on an expedited basis in the united states and worldwide 
panamsat modified its expansion plan to accommodate the back up and restoration needs of its largest customers in light of the unforeseen technical problems that occurred during described in the previous section 
panamsat expects to launch six additional satellites by late  consisting of three new satellites for latin america pas r  pas and galaxy iii c and three new satellites for the united states galaxy xi  galaxy iv r and galaxy x r 
galaxy iii c will carry a payload capable of supporting services for both latin america and the united states 
one of the company s existing satellites  sbs  which has reached the end of its expected life  is expected to be removed from service by mid  resulting in a planned total fleet of satellites  including multiple satellites in each ocean region worldwide and one in orbit spare satellite galaxy vi for the united states 
the company also will have options to procure three ground spare satellites for launch on an expedited basis 
panamsat s us strategy anticipates that it will launch galaxy xi in the third quarter of initially  galaxy xi will be located at degrees wl  galaxy vi s current location 
this will permit galaxy vi to return to its original intended service as a back up for the company s us customers 
it is anticipated that galaxy vi will be located initially at degrees wl  where it will be co located with galaxy vii  and due to frequency interference  will not be capable of offering services simultaneously with galaxy vii 
galaxy iv r  which is expected to be launched in late  will be deployed at degrees wl for permanent service 
upon the successful deployment of galaxy iv r  galaxy xi will be moved to degrees wl and galaxy vii which is currently located at degrees wl will be moved to a new orbital location to be determined 
galaxy vi will be moved to degrees wl where it will continue to provide back up services 
also in late  the company anticipates that it will launch galaxy x r  which will be permanently located at degrees wl  enabling galaxy ix to be relocated at degrees wl sbs will then be taken out of service 
in mid  the company plans to launch galaxy iii c  which is expected to be deployed at degrees wl for services to the domestic wl and latin america 
galaxy iii r would be moved for service at a new orbital location to be determined 
the company expects that pas will be launched during and will be located in the aor 
the company s mexico dth customer which had contracted for service on pas instead has contracted to take service on pas the ku band transponders on pas will not be resold on a full time basis  and the company anticipates that this will minimize the disruption to pas s c band customers as a result of its battery problems 
in the second half of  the company expects to launch pas r  which is intended to replace and significantly expand upon the capacity offered by pas  which may be used to back up pas r or moved to another orbital location not yet determined 
upon the successful transition of services from pas to pas b  it is anticipated that the pas satellite will be used for backup or other services from a location to be determined 
the implementation of the plan is subject to regulatory approval by the fcc 
the company expects that after the successful launch of the previously described satellites  the revenues attributable to the galaxy vi  galaxy vii  pas and pas satellites will be at a reduced level compared to the company s other satellites 
the company has not yet determined whether revenue will be adversely impacted on galaxy iii r after the completion of the satellite deployment plan 
no assurance can be given that commercially suitable orbital locations will be obtained for all of these satellites 
successful implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to risks attendant to the company s business and the requirement of additional capital 
see liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources pursuant to the merger  aggregate consideration paid to panamsat international stockholders consisted of approximately billion in cash and approximately million shares of panamsat common stock 
in connection with the merger  the company obtained a term loan in the amount of billion the hughes term loan from hughes electronics  an affiliate of the company 
in addition to the hughes term loan  at december  the company also had long term indebtedness of million of the notes as defined below 
the significant cash outlays for the company will continue to be primarily capital expenditures related to the construction and launch of satellites  debt service costs and potential acquisitions 
the company now has six satellites under various stages of development for which the company has budgeted capital expenditures 
see risk factors 
the company will require approximately million to complete the construction  insure  and launch such satellites 
in addition to funding the construction and launch of new satellites  the company may choose to exercise certain remaining early buy out options under certain satellite sale leaseback transactions entered into in prior years 
during  the company funded outlays of approximately million in connection with the exercise of early buy out options relating to transponders on sbs in addition  if the company were to elect to exercise its remaining early buy out options under certain sale leaseback transactions  it would be required to fund outlays of approximately million in including an early buy out option for million including a make whole premium of million relating to transponders on galaxy vii that was exercised by the company in january 
on january   panamsat completed a private placement pursuant to rule a under the securities act of for million aggregate principal amount of debt securities the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay bank loans incurred partially to finance a tender offer for certain debt securities of panamsat s subsidiaries  as well as for general corporate purposes 
in august  the company converted the private securities to public debt the notes by means of a registered exchange offer 
in connection with the offering  the company executed a credit agreement the credit agreement with certain lenders and citicorp usa  inc as administrative agent 
the credit agreement amends and restates the credit agreement among the parties dated december  the original credit agreement 
the original credit agreement provided the company with up to million of revolving credit loans the revolving credit loans for five years  and up to million in short term loans maturing on april  the term loans 
the credit agreement amended the original credit agreement to terminate the short term loan facility 
the company currently has million of revolving credit loans available to it under the credit agreement less any amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as described below 
on july   the company initiated a million commercial paper program the commercial paper program 
borrowings under the credit agreement and the commercial paper program are limited to million in the aggregate and are expected to be used to fund the company s satellite construction program 
as of march   the company had approximately million of notes outstanding under the commercial paper program 
the hughes term loan is subordinate to the notes issued in connection with the offering  the revolving credit loans and the notes issued under the commercial paper program 
panamsat believes that  in addition to the commercial paper program  credit agreement  vendor financing  future cash flow from operations assuming satellites in development are successfully launched and commence service on the schedule currently contemplated and cash on hand  it will need additional financing of up to million to fund its operations  its anticipated exercise of certain early buy out options on certain satellite sale leaseback transactions and its remaining costs for the construction and launch of satellites currently under development for the next twelve months 
the company intends to obtain such additional financing by increasing its current borrowing facilities or from other financing sources which may become available 
there can be no assurance  however  that panamsat s assumptions with respect to future construction and launch costs will be correct  or that additional vendor financing  satellite insurance proceeds  panamsat s future cash flow from operations and borrowings under the commercial paper program and or credit agreement will be sufficient to cover any shortfall in funding for future launches caused by launch failures  cost overruns  delays or other unanticipated expenses 
in addition  if the company were to consummate any strategic transactions or undertake any other projects requiring significant capital expenditures  it may be required to seek additional financing 
if circumstances were to require panamsat to incur additional indebtedness  the ability of panamsat to incur any such additional indebtedness would be subject to the terms of panamsat s outstanding indebtedness 
the failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on panamsat s operations and its ability to accomplish its business plan 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in  from million in  a decrease from million in the increase in was primarily attributable to increased operating results  proceeds from insurance claims and reductions in non cash working capital as compared to the decrease in was primarily attributable to payment of various liabilities acquired in the merger 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in  from  million in  an increase from million in the decrease in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of panamsat international during the same period in  coupled with proceeds from insurance claims received during the increase in was primarily attributable to the net cash paid in connection with the merger and additional capital expenditures for satellite systems under development  offset by proceeds from the sale of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million in from  million in  an increase from million in the decrease in was primarily due to obtaining the hughes term loan during the same period in the increase in was primarily due to new borrowings including the hughes term loan  offset by repayments of long term debt in connection with the tender offer for certain debt securities of the company s subsidiaries 
market risks from time to time the company is exposed to market risks relating to interest rate changes 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   in connection with its debt refinancing activities  the company entered into certain us treasury rate lock contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the aggregate nominal value of these contracts was million and these contracts were accounted for as hedges because they were applied to a specific refinancing plan that was consummated shortly after december  the fair value of these financial instruments at december  approximated their contract value 
the cost to unwind these instruments in was million and this amount has been deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt securities to which such hedges were applied 
year readiness disclosure many of the world s computer systems currently use a two digit format  as opposed to a four digit format  to indicate the year 
if not modified  these computer systems will be unable to properly recognize dates beyond the year  which could lead to system failures and business disruption in the us and internationally 
panamsat s year plan yk plan addresses year issues in the following phases i identification of the company s systems  equipment and suppliers that may be vulnerable to year issues  ii assessment of the areas identified to determine risks associated with their failure to be year compliant and corrective actions that would be necessary to prevent such failure  iii correction of affected systems and equipment  iv testing of systems and equipment to determine if year compliant  and v contingency planning for reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
panamsat commenced its yk plan in a project team  consisting of members of the engineering  operations  and software development groups meets regularly and is in charge of plan scheduling and implementation 
identification of susceptible systems and assessment of the corrective actions has been completed by all functional areas 
none of the company s primary assets  the in orbit satellites  have date dependent processing and therefore they are not at substantial risk due to year issues 
station keeping operations for the company s satellites are not date dependent and no real time commands will be required at the time of the date of change 
correction of the tt c software for hsc manufactured satellites is the most significant component of the yk plan 
updating the control software represents the largest element of the yk plan approximately in terms of both cost and time  and of this portion approximately of the update effort was assigned to a single third party software vendor and yk solutions provider the raytheon company 
in the fall of  the company hired an additional yk solutions provider to expedite the modification of the control software 
the company also has dedicated in house software staff to begin making certain necessary upgrades and modifications 
while the vast majority of the software modifications and testing will be complete by mid  installation of the modified software at remote tt c sites and final testing of the entire system is not expected to be complete until the fourth quarter of modification of software used to provide communications services to customers other than satellite control software is on schedule for mid completion 
except with respect to the third party activities relating to satellite control software  all project coordination and systems modifications are being performed by internal personnel 
compliance verification requests have been sent to all identified third party equipment and system suppliers 
over of such suppliers have responded to the company s verification requests with approximately of them indicating that the systems they provided are year compliant 
panamsat s yk plan team is working with such suppliers to correct all non compliant systems 
updates of compressed digital video systems and loral tt c equipment are expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of it is expected that all of these critical systems will be year compliant by mid the company has also completed an evaluation of the various management information systems used by the company for financial and administrative functions and has determined that such systems are largely yk compliant 
upgrades are planned for all non compliant elements  and existing back up procedures can be used to perform normal company financial and administrative functions in the event of potentially uncorrected problems 
the company has identified the potential loss of real time satellite control software functionality as a reasonably likely worst case scenario 
preliminary contingency plans are being developed involving the use of back dated processors to operate the satellite control systems  which would result in slightly higher operation costs until any remaining year problems are corrected 
in addition  satellite control may be handled manually 
the company is confident that either of these methods would provide adequate satellite control  but the company has not completed its evaluation of the risks associated with these station keeping methods 
the company expects to complete the preparation of formal contingency plans by mid internal efforts on yk projects have had a minimal impact on other non yk it and non it projects 
any transition of activities currently being performed by third party yk solutions providers to internal resources could delay some internal software projects 
the yk plan is funded from cash flows from the company s operations and is currently in line with budgeted amounts 
approximately  has been incurred to date in connection with the yk plan 
of this amount  approximately  was incurred in and  during the total remaining cost through completion of the yk plan is expected to be approximately million  including anticipated third party costs 
if additional yk solutions providers become necessary for remediation of satellite control software  the cost of the yk plan will increase 
based on its current assessment efforts  the company does not believe that year issues will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company s year issues  however  and any potential business interruption  costs  damages  or losses related thereto  are also dependent upon the year compliance of third parties  both domestic and international  such as governmental agencies  vendors and suppliers 
as a result  the company is unable to determine at this time whether year issues for third parties will materially affect the company 
risk factors risks associated with technology 
satellites are subject to significant risks related to delayed and failed launches and in orbit failures 
of the satellite launches by panamsat or its predecessors since  the company has experienced four launch failures and one in orbit failure 
each of these satellites was insured in an amount sufficient to substantially recover the company s investment therein 
a significant delay in the delivery or launch of any future satellite would adversely affect the company s marketing plan for such satellite 
delays can result from the construction of satellites and launch vehicles  launch failures  the periodic unavailability of reliable launch opportunities and possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals 
if satellite construction schedules are not met  there can be no assurance that a launch opportunity will be available at the time a satellite is ready to be launched 
the occurrence of a launch failure results in a significant delay in the deployment of a particular satellite because of the need both to construct a replacement satellite and obtain another launch opportunity 
a significant delay in the launch of any of panamsat s satellites could enable customers who pre purchased or agreed to lease capacity of such satellites to terminate their contracts 
certain launch vehicles present special risks to the company 
certain launch vehicles scheduled to be used by panamsat have unproven track records and are susceptible to certain risks associated with new launch vehicles 
for example  sea launch is a launcher that may be used by panamsat to launch satellites within the next year 
sea launch is a joint venture among boeing  kvaerner as  rsc energia and the npo yuzhnoye space concern 
this launch will utilize a three stage launch vehicle launched from a new semi submersible launch platform in the pacific ocean near the equator 
the first two stages of the sea launch vehicle will be based upon prior generations of npo yuzhnoye s zenit launch vehicle  and the third stage will be based upon prior generations of the fourth stage of rsc energia s proton launch vehicle 
although a successful demonstration launch was completed in march  this launcher has no commercial launch history  which poses heightened risks  including potential launch delays and failures 
there can be no assurance that panamsat s planned launches will be successful or will occur on schedule 
see satellite deployment plan and item business the satellites for a discussion of the company s satellite deployment plan and related launch schedule 
a trade agreement between the united states and russian governments limits the number of satellites manufactured in the united states which may be launched aboard russian launch vehicles through the end of the year  which could impact panamsat launches on russian rockets 
although panamsat s russian launch provider has informed the company that it is seeking to have the limit raised or eliminated  there can be no assurance that such modification will be achieved  which could result in a launch delay or increased launch costs 
in addition  congress is currently investigating certain foreign launches of us manufactured satellites 
although the company does not believe that any of its launch providers have been implicated in the investigation  there can be no assurance that future launches by non us providers will not be adversely affected by this investigation  including the possibility of significant launch delays 
all of the company s planned launches are scheduled to occur on non us launchers 
the failure to implement the satellite deployment plan on schedule could have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
satellites are also subject to risks after they have been properly deployed and put into operation 
the likelihood of in orbit failure may be heightened by panamsat s use on certain of its satellites of new technology 
galaxy xi  galaxy iii c and pas r are scheduled to be hughes manufactured hs model spacecraft 
the hs model has an unproven track record and may be susceptible to certain risks related to its new technology 
there can be no assurance that panamsat s planned use of hs model spacecraft will be successful 
although the company obtains launch insurance policies designed to cover the cost to construct  launch and insure replacement satellites  there is a risk that certain losses may not be covered by the company s policies 
typically  panamsat s launch policies are effective for three years from the date of a satellite launch 
during that time  if a covered malfunction occurs  but no loss is incurred until after the expiration of the policy  the launch insurance policy will not cover the loss  and a subsequent in orbit policy obtained may either exclude losses related to the known event or impose deductibles that exceed the loss associated with the event 
see item business the satellites insurance 
for a detailed discussion of certain spacecraft health issues which affect the company s satellite fleet and the company s related satellite deployment plan  see spacecraft developments  satellite deployment plan  and item business the satellites 
the implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to regulatory approval by the fcc 
the company expects that after the completion of the satellite deployment plan  the revenues attributable to the galaxy vi  galaxy vii  pas and pas satellites will be at reduced levels compared to the company s other satellites 
the company has not yet determined whether revenue will be adversely impacted on galaxy iii r after completion of the satellite deployment plan 
no assurance can be given that commercially suitable orbital locations will be obtained for these satellites 
successful implementation of the satellite deployment plan is subject to risks attendant to the company s business and the requirement of additional capital 
see liquidity and capital resources and regulatory risks 
regulatory risks 
the satellite industry is highly regulated both in the united states and internationally 
panamsat is subject to the regulatory authority of the us government primarily the fcc and the national communications authorities of the countries in which it operates 
the business prospects of panamsat could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  policies  regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies or regulations  that modify the present regulatory environment 
while panamsat has generally been successful in obtaining necessary licenses  there can be no assurance that panamsat will obtain all requisite regulatory approvals for the construction  launch and operation of any of panamsat s future satellites and for the orbital slots planned for these satellites or  if obtained  that such licenses will not impose operational restrictions on panamsat 
nor can there be any assurance that panamsat will succeed in coordinating any or all of its future satellites internationally 
panamsat s successful implementation of the satellite deployment plan depends upon the company s ability to obtain regulatory authorization to operate its satellites at certain locations 
no assurance can be made that panamsat will obtain all of the authorizations necessary for the completion of the satellite deployment plan 
the failure to implement the satellite deployment plan on schedule could have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
see item business government regulation 
regulatory schemes in countries in which panamsat operates may impose impediments to the company s operations 
panamsat  its customers or companies with which panamsat does business must have authority from each country in which panamsat provides services or its customers use its satellites 
although panamsat believes that it  its customers and or companies with which it does business presently hold the requisite licenses and approvals for the countries in which it currently provides services  the regulatory schemes in each country are different and thus there may be instances of noncompliance of which panamsat is not aware 
in addition  portions of panamsat s present and future satellites are designed to provide service to countries in which regulatory impediments exist 
although panamsat believes these regulatory schemes will not prevent it from pursuing its business plan  there can be no assurance that any current regulatory approvals held by panamsat are  or will remain  sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that any additional necessary approvals will be granted on a timely basis  or at all  in all jurisdictions in which the company wishes to operate its new satellites or that restrictions applicable thereto will not be unduly burdensome

certain of the frequencies that are intended to be used to uplink to pas  pas and galaxy viii i must be coordinated with the us government on an earth station by earth station basis to ensure that harmful interference to government operations is minimized 
panamsat has undertaken such coordination and believes that it will either be able to coordinate successfully with federal government users or to institute operational solutions that will mitigate the problem  but there can be no assurance that panamsat s efforts will be successful 
panamsat has received conditional regulatory approval for the orbital slot of degrees el from the fcc  which approval is subject to a full financial showing and demonstration of consultation with intelsat 
it is unlikely that pas will be permitted to operate its c band transponders until certain coordination issues are resolved with the russian federation 
certain of the ku band downlink beams on pas include coverage  at very low power levels  of the west coast of the united states and of hawaii 
because the ku band frequencies on these beams are allocated in the united states to the bss  panamsat s coverage of the united states is on a non conforming use basis  requiring that panamsat not interfere with  and accept interference from  any authorized users in the united states 
the fcc gives a replacement expectancy with respect to the use of the same orbital location at the same frequencies for replacement satellites 
this replacement expectancy may increase the likelihood that panamsat will be able to use pas r to expand the frequencies or coverages employed by pas at degrees wl  however  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful at expanding such frequencies and coverages 
sbs s fcc license expired in  and the satellite is operated pursuant to grants of special temporary authority that are renewed periodically 
following the failure of galaxy iv  the fcc granted the company special temporary authority to relocate galaxy vi from degrees wl to degrees wl to provide replacement c band capacity 
currently  the company anticipates relocating galaxy vi to degrees wl  subject to applicable regulatory approvals 
once slots have been identified  the company plans to apply for temporary authority to operate at such locations until other satellites are authorized for  and commence operations at  such slots 
the company has received special temporary authority to relocate brasilsat a from degrees wl to degrees wl and to operate brasilsat a at the new orbital location
