enterprise computing system in addition to those changes  the implementation of a more sophisticated enterprise wide computer operating system began during the year 
with this new system  the operations of the business are expected to become more efficient due to the streamlining of processes and procedures  many of which are being performed manually 
the information to be provided from this system will assist management with day to day operating decisions 
results of operations net income for the year ended march   net income was million  or 
per share  compared to a net income of million  or 
per share  for the year ended march  net income for the three months ended march  was million  or 
per share  compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march  the most significant difference in net income for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year ended march  was a deferred tax benefit of million recorded in the fourth quarter of associated with the accumulated tax benefit of prior operating losses 
a similar tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal the amount of the net deferred tax asset estimated to be recoverable was based on our assessment of the likelihood of near term operating income and that the realization of net operating loss carryforward was more likely than not 
operating income for the year ended march  was approximately million  or 
per share  compared to an operating loss of approximately million  or 
per share  for fiscal included in the results of operations for fiscal and were charges of  and million  respectively  associated with the write down and closure of certain european subsidiaries 
net sales trends by major product brands percent increase years ended march  decrease in thousands domestic sales professional sales    over the counter otc sales    clinical laboratory sales    original equipment manufacture oem sales  total domestic sales    international sales export sales    european subsidiary sales    total international sales    total net sales    our oem product sales increased dramatically in fiscal due to the distribution of our veterinary products for the full year compared to only a few months in fiscal  as well as to the launch of a new partnered retail store brand program for distribution of pregnancy tests 
in fiscal  we reassessed our international sales strategy and in fiscal  completed the closure of european subsidiaries located in france  the netherlands and spain 
as a result international sales declined except sales in the german subsidiary increased  in fiscal to approximately million due to new distributor programs in europe 
revenue from research contracts  license fees and royalties percent increase decrease years ended march  in thousands contract research and development    license fee income royalty income total    contract research and development revenue is principally related to funding provided by glaxo wellcome for two separate multi year rapid diagnostic test development programs for influenza a and b  which commenced in march  and the development of two point of care diagnostic tests to detect herpes simplex virus hsv  which commenced in october in may  a k application was filed with the food and drug administration fda for marketing clearance of the influenza a and b point of care test 
the anticipated filing of a k application for clearance for the hsv tests is expected to be during the revenue recognized under the glaxo wellcome programs is equal to the sum of the program direct research costs see operating expenses  below and allocated support service costs 
license fee income generally relates to one time fees received for the right to distribute our products 
cost of sales and gross profit percent increase decrease years ended march  in thousands direct cost material  labor and other variable costs    as a percentage of sales royalty expense patent licenses   as a percentage of sales total direct cost    as a percentage of sales direct margin contribution per sales dollar manufacturing overhead cost    as a percentage of sales total cost of sales    gross profit    as a percentage of sales gross profit declined approximately two percentage points to of sales in fiscal from the prior year level 
the shift in product mix toward sales of our oem pregnancy tests  which provide a lower direct margin contribution  has increased direct cost as a percent of sales 
manufacturing overhead cost increases in fiscal related to increased production capacity  the purchase of automation equipment  and the addition of purchasing and engineering support staff 
operating expenses percent increase decrease years ended march  in thousands research and development quidel research projects    as a percentage of sales contract research direct costs    as a percentage of sales total research and development    as a percentage of sales sales and marketing domestic professional sales and marketing    domestic otc sales and marketing international sales and marketing    total sales and marketing    as a percentage of sales general and administrative    as a percentage of sales write down and closure of european subsidiaries  as a percentage of sales total operating expenses    as a percentage of sales total operating expenses  excluding contract research and write down of subsidiary investment    as a percentage of sales research and development remained constant in fiscal compared to as we continued our efforts in several collaborative product development programs 
the glaxo wellcome influenza a and b and hsv programs  previously discussed  are the largest of these projects 
contract research expense represented of the company s total research and development investment in fiscal sales and marketing efficiencies continued to improve in fiscal as the overall cost declined to of sales 
domestic otc and oem sales and marketing expenses continue to decline as these expenses are assumed by outside distributors 
these savings partially offset the lower margin on domestic otc oem products from reduced sales prices under these distribution agreements 
international sales and marketing expenses declined due to the closure of our european subsidiaries and now represent approximately of total international sales 
general and administrative expenses increased significantly in fiscal this increase contained million of non recurring restructuring costs including employee severance costs  legal fees and consulting costs 
without these non recurring costs  general and administrative costs would have decreased by approximately  from fiscal liquidity and capital resources at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at march  cash and cash equivalents declined in fiscal primarily due to our investments in implementing an enterprise wide computer system to assist in operating our business more efficiently  as well as to investments in improved technology to increase efficiencies in manufacturing operations 
the principal requirements for cash are for working capital  including capital equipment 
cash requirements are expected to be funded by the results of operations 
in addition  cash is anticipated to be raised during fiscal through the sale and leaseback of the corporate headquarters facility  a portion of which will be used to repay the million real estate loan balance and the line of credit associated with the acquisition of metra biosystems  inc see subsequent event below 
cash requirements fluctuate as a result of numerous factors  such as the extent to which we use or generate cash in operations  progress in research and development projects  competition and technological developments and the time and expenditures required to obtain governmental approval of our products 
based on the current cash position and the current assessment of future operating results  we believe that the existing sources of liquidity should be adequate to meet operating needs during fiscal year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
our program we established a year compliance team in this team consists of members from each functional area of the company 
the implementation of a full year compliance program is ongoing 
our chief financial officer is the officer responsible for the year compliance program and the individual who leads the year compliance team reports directly to the chief financial officer 
our audit committee and board of directors provides supervisorial oversight of our efforts relating to year readiness 
we presently believe that the year issue can be mitigated through testing designed to confirm readiness 
however  if such testing refutes readiness  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
our plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
to date  we have fully completed assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of our significant systems are ready for the year accordingly  we do not believe that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to our operations 
in addition  we have gathered information about the year compliance status of our significant suppliers and subcontractors and we continue to monitor their compliance 
we have completed the assessment phase of all of our operations and business activities 
we have determined that our products are year ready 
during the assessment phase  we identified several business systems which were not year compliant 
we have since converted some of those business systems to be fully year ready  such as our telephone system  and we are now in the process of converting our business enterprise software 
we anticipate that conversion and testing of the enterprise software will be completed by the end of the second quarter of and that we will be operating on this system by the end of the third quarter of furthermore  as a result of our assessment of other  less critical systems which are not year compliant  we believe we have identified adequate remedies to make those systems year ready 
specific examples of non compliant systems we have identified include certain desktop personal computers and applications software where compliant versions are readily available from current suppliers as well as others 
we expect to complete renovation of our less critical systems by october completion of the testing phase for all significant systems is expected by december to date  approximately of our systems have been tested and found to be compliant 
third parties and the year we have queried our significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with us external agents 
to date  we have not become aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact our results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  we have no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
to further assess the stability of our supply chain  we are continuing to communicate with suppliers regarding their programs 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact us 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
year renovation costs we will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows primarily to be incurred in the second half of the actual amount we spend may differ materially from our estimates due to a variety of factors including the availability of trained personnel and other resources  and our ability to identify  assess and test all relevant systems 
risks management believes it has an effective program in place to test and confirm year readiness in a timely manner 
the final phases of the year program have not yet been completed 
in the event that we do not complete the testing phase to confirm readiness  and if the systems believed to be ready are not  we may be unable to manufacture and distribute products and may be unable to use our financial and operating systems 
such a scenario could result in loss of revenues which could cause a material adverse impact to our operations  liquidity  capital resources or financial results 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect us 
we could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of potential liability and lost revenue we could experience in that event 
contingency plans we have developed contingency plans to address failure of renovation activities as applied to internal systems and external agents 
we have identified specific contingency plan options related to our supply chain management process 
for example  in assessing our critical suppliers  we have prioritized these business relationships and are developing plans to provide for the continuance of product availability through accelerated purchasing should adequate assurances regarding a specific entity s ability to become ready for the year not be obtained 
we expect that our contingency plans will be developed by july however  there can be no guarantee that the plans or the implementation of the plans will be adequate to protect against adverse impacts to our operations  liquidity  capital resources or financial results 
subsequent event tender offer metra biosystems  inc 
in june  the company announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire metra biosystems  inc metra for approximately million  or per share based upon  shares outstanding  including vested options  in an all cash tender offer 
metra is a world leader in the diagnosis and detection of bone loss for the management of osteoporosis and other bone diseases 
completion of the tender offer is expected by the end of july  and is subject to of the shares being tendered  execution of retention agreements by key employees  minimum cash balance at closing and other customary closing conditions 
at the close of the tender offer  it is anticipated that the total consolidation and transaction costs to the company will be approximately million  net of metra s estimated cash of approximately million 
the tender offer will be financed from our cash reserves  proceeds from a short term bank loan and proceeds from a revolving line of credit 
the short term bank loan will be repaid with the metra cash acquired  while the line of credit will be repaid with the proceeds of the contemplated sale and leaseback of the corporate facility
