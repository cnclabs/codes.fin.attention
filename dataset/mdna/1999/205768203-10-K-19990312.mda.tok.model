although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimate and such revisions  if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
all forward looking statements in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph 
definitions the following are abbreviations and definitions of terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry and this report 
natural gas equivalents and crude oil equivalents are determined using the ratio of six mcf to one bbl 
bbl means a barrel of us gallons of oil 
bcf means one billion cubic feet of natural gas 
bcfe means one billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
cash margin per mcfe means the equivalent price per mcfe less oil and gas operating expenses per mcfe and general and administrative expenses per mcfe 
completion means the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or gas 
condensate means a hydrocarbon mixture that becomes liquid and separates from natural gas when the gas is produced and is similar to crude oil 
development well means a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive 
dry hole means a well found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of such production exceed production expenses and taxes 
exploratory well means a well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves not classified as proved  to find a new productive reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir 
gross when used with respect to acres or wells  production or reserves refers to the total acres or wells in which the company or other specified person has a working interest 
mbbls means one thousand barrels of oil 
mmbbls means one million barrels of oil 
mcf means one thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
mcfe means thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
mmcf means one million cubic feet of natural gas 
mmcfe means one million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent 
net when used with respect to acres or wells  refers to gross acres of wells multiplied  in each case  by the percentage working interest owned by the company 
net production means production that is owned by the company less royalties and production due others 
oil means crude oil or condensate 
operator means the individual or company responsible for the exploration  development  and production of an oil or gas well or lease 
present value of proved reserves means the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves calculated in accordance with the securities and exchange commission guidelines  net of estimated production and future development costs  using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation  without giving effect to non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service  future income tax expense and depreciation  depletion and amortization  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
proved developed reserves means reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery will be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved reserves means the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
i reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation tests 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes a that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and b the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
ii reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
iii estimates of proved reserves do not include the following a oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  b crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  c crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and d crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such resources 
proved undeveloped reserves means reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
recompletion means the completion for production of an existing well bore in another formation from that in which the well has been previously completed 
reserve life means the calculation derived by dividing year end reserves by total production in that year 
reserve replacement means the calculation derived by dividing additions to reserves from acquisitions  extensions  discoveries and revisions of previous estimates in a year by total production in that year 
royalty means an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage or of the proceeds of the sale thereof  but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the cost of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage 
royalties may be either landowner s royalties  which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted  or overriding royalties  which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner 
d seismic means an advanced technology method of detecting accumulations of hydrocarbons identified by the collection and measurement of the intensity and timing of sound waves transmitted into the earth as they reflect back to the surface 
working interest means an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations 
the share of production to which a working interest owner is entitled will always be smaller than the share of costs that the working interest owner is required to bear  with the balance of the production accruing to the owners of royalties 
for example  the owner of a working interest in a lease burdened only by a landowner s royalty of would be required to pay of the costs of a well but would be entitled to retain of the production 
workover means operations on a producing well to restore or increase production 
part i items and business and properties comstock resources  inc together with its subsidiaries  the company or comstock is an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  development  production and exploration of oil and natural gas properties

over the past five years  the company has been able to lower lifting costs and general and administrative expenses per unit of production  concurrent with increases in production  through strict control over operations and costs 
comstock s lifting costs per mcfe have decreased from in to in comstock s general and administrative expenses per mcfe have decreased from in to in operated wells represent of the company s present value of proved reserves as of december   which enables comstock to effectively control costs and expenses and the timing and method of exploration and development of its properties 
additionally  comstock s geographic focus allows it to manage its asset base with a relatively small number of employees 
business strategy the company s strategy is to increase cash flow and net asset value by exploiting its reserves  pursuing selective exploration opportunities  maintaining a low cost structure and acquiring oil and gas properties at attractive costs 
exploit existing reserves the company seeks to maximize the value of its properties by increasing production and recoverable reserves through active workover  recompletion and exploitation activities 
the company utilizes advanced industry technology  including d seismic data  improved logging tools and formation stimulation techniques 
during  the company spent million to drill development wells net  of which wells net were successful  representing a success rate of 
in addition  the company spent approximately million for recompletion and workover activity during the company has budgeted up to million in for development drilling and installation of production facilities 
comstock s level of spending on development drilling in will be principally dependent on improvement to existing oil and gas prices 
pursue selective exploration opportunities the company pursues selective exploration activities to find additional reserves on its undeveloped acreage 
in  the company spent approximately million to drill exploratory wells net  of which eight wells net were successful  representing a success rate of 
the company has budgeted up to million in for exploration activities which will be focused on the gulf of mexico region and based on drilling d seismic generated prospects 
these prospects include those acquired from bois d arc resources and certain of its affiliates and working interest partners  and those prospects generated under the joint exploration program with bois d arc resources and its principals bois d arc entered into in december under which the company and bois d arc jointly explore for prospects in the gulf of mexico region the bois d arc exploration venture 
under the bois d arc exploration venture  bois d arc is responsible for identifying potential prospects and the parties jointly acquire d seismic data and leasehold acreage  the costs for which are shared by the company and by bois d arc 
with respect to any prospect in which the company elects to participate in drilling  the company acquires up to working interest and recovers any disproportionate seismic and leasehold costs previously incurred 
the company issued to bois d arc warrants to acquire up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share as part of the venture 
the warrants vest in  share increments based on the success of an initial test well on a prospect 
maintain low cost structure the company seeks to increase cash flow by carefully controlling operating costs and general and administrative expenses 
the company targets acquisitions that possess  among other characteristics  low per unit operating costs 
in addition  the company has been able to reduce per unit operating costs by eliminating unnecessary field and corporate overhead costs and by divesting properties that have high lifting costs with little future development potential 
through these efforts  the company s general and administrative expenses and average oil and gas operating costs per mcfe have decreased from and  respectively  in to and  respectively  in in addition  the company prefers to operate the properties it acquires  allowing it to further control operating costs  exercise greater control over the timing and plans for future development  the level of drilling and lifting costs  and the marketing of production

using a strategy that capitalizes on management s strong knowledge of and experience in these regions  the company seeks to selectively pursue acquisition opportunities where the company can evaluate the assets to be acquired in detail prior to completion of the transaction 
the company evaluates a large number of prospective properties according to certain internal criteria  including established production and the properties future development and exploration potential  low operating costs and the ability for the company to obtain operating control 
the company believes that due to the current environment of depressed commodity prices  the industry will continue to consolidate as companies look to divest oil and gas properties 
as a result  the company may have opportunities to make acquisitions at favorable prices  including attractive acquisitions outside its core operating areas 
major property acquisitions as a result of its acquisitions  the company has added bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves since as summarized in the following table present acquisition value of cost as a proved percentage reserves of present acquisition acquisition when value of cost proved reserves when acquired cost per acquired proved year s mbbls mmcf mmcfe mcfe s reserves total      based on reserve estimates and prices at the end of the year in which the acquisition occurred  as adjusted to reflect actual production from the closing date of the respective acquisition to such year end

the net proved reserves acquired were estimated at mmbbls of oil and bcf of natural gas 
approximately million of the purchase price was attributed to the undrilled prospects and million was attributed to other assets 
black stone acquisition 
in may  the company acquired of the capital stock of black stone oil company and interests in producing and undeveloped oil and gas properties located in southeast texas for million 
the company acquired interests in wells net that are located in the double a wells field in polk county  texas and is the operator of most of the wells in the field 
the net proved reserves acquired were estimated at mmbbls of oil and bcf of natural gas 
sonat acquisition 
in july  the company purchased interests in certain producing oil and gas properties located in east texas and north louisiana from sonat inc for million 
the company acquired interests in producing wells net 
the acquisition included interests in the beckville  logansport  waskom  blocker  longwood and simsboro fields 
the net proved reserves acquired were estimated at mmbbls of oil and bcf of natural gas 
stanford acquisition 
in november  the company acquired stanford offshore energy  inc stanford through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary 
the stanford stockholders were issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock of the company in the merger with a total value of million and the company assumed approximately million of indebtedness of stanford 
stanford had interests in producing wells net located primarily in the gulf of mexico region 
major properties acquired include west cameron blocks  and  the east white point field and the redmond creek field 
the net proved reserves acquired were estimated at mmbbls of oil and bcf of natural gas

the reserve data set forth above represents estimates only 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based on the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas reserves that are ultimately recovered 
in general  the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent the company acquires properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration and development activities  the proved reserves of the company will decline as reserves are produced 
the company s future oil and natural gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon its level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves 
the company s average price received for crude oil production on december  was per bbl 
this price declined to per bbl on december  the company s average price received for natural gas production on december  was per mcf 
this price declined to per mcf on december  further declines in the price of crude oil or natural gas could have an adverse effect on the company s present value of proved reserves  which in turn could adversely affect borrowing capacity and the company s ability to obtain additional capital and the company s financial condition  revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations

all of the company s oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under the company s bank credit facility 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  the company is generally able to retain its ownership interest in undeveloped acreage by production of existing wells  by drilling activity which establishes commercial reserves sufficient to maintain the lease or by payment of delay rentals 
markets and customers the market for oil and natural gas produced by the company depends on factors beyond its control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  demand for oil and natural gas  the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation 
the oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
substantially all of the company s natural gas production is sold either on the spot natural gas market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or under long term contracts based on current spot market gas prices 
a portion of the natural gas production from the company s double a wells field is sold under a long term contract to houston pipeline company  a subsidiary of enron corporation hpl 
the agreement with hpl expires on october  with pricing based on a percentage of spot gas prices for natural gas delivered to the houston ship channel 
total gas sales in to hpl accounted for approximately of the company s oil and gas sales 
gas production from the company s offshore properties at the ship shoal and main pass areas  which represented of the company s oil and gas sales  is sold under a short term contract based on spot market gas prices to h n gas  ltd 
all of the company s oil production is sold at the well site at posted field prices tied to the spot oil markets 
sales of oil production from the company s ship shoal and main pass offshore properties to gulfmark energy  inc  accounted for of the company s oil and gas sales 
competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
competitors include major oil companies  other independent energy companies  and individual producers and operators  many of which have financial resources  personnel and facilities substantially greater than those of the company 
the company faces intense competition for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
regulation the company s operations are regulated by certain federal and state agencies 
in particular  oil and natural gas production and related operations are or have been subject to price controls  taxes and other laws relating to the oil and natural gas industry 
the company cannot predict how existing laws and regulations may be interpreted by enforcement agencies or court rulings  whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted  or the effect such changes may have on its business or financial condition 
sales of natural gas by the company are not regulated and are made at market prices 
however  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates interstate and certain intrastate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions  which affect the marketing of natural gas produced by the company  as well as the revenues received by the company for sales of such production 
since the mid s  ferc has issued a series of orders  culminating in order nos 
 a and b order  that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of gas 
order mandated a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation service  including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales  transportation  storage and other components of the city gate sales services such pipelines previously performed 
one of ferc s purposes in issuing the orders was to increase competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
generally  order has eliminated or substantially reduced the interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas  and has substantially increased competition and volatility in natural gas markets 
sales of oil and natural gas liquids by the company are not regulated and are made at market prices 
the price the company receives from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market 
the company s oil and natural gas exploration  production and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal  state and local agencies 
failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the company s cost of doing business and affects its profitability 
because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted  the company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws 
the states of texas and louisiana require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and the filing of reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas 
these states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the regulation of spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
the statutes and regulations of certain states limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced from the company s properties 
the company is required to comply with various federal and state regulations regarding plugging and abandonment of oil and natural gas wells 
the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of plugging and abandoning its wells  to the extent such costs exceed the estimated salvage value of the wells  on a unit of production basis 
environmental various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  health and safety  affect the company s operations and costs 
these laws and regulations sometimes require governmental authorization before conducting certain activities  limit or prohibit other activities because of protected areas or species  create the possibility of substantial liabilities for pollution related to company operations or properties  and provide penalties for noncompliance 
in particular  the company s drilling and production operations  its activities in connection with storage and transportation of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons  and its use of facilities for treating  processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and related exploration and production wastes are subject to stringent environmental regulation 
as with the industry in general  compliance with existing and anticipated regulations increases the company s overall cost of business 
while these regulations affect the company s capital expenditures and earnings  the company believes that such regulations do not affect its competitive position in the industry because its competitors are similarly affected by environmental regulatory programs 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change and  therefore  the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs or other future impacts of environmental regulations on its future operations 
a discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could subject the company to substantial expense  including the cost to comply with applicable regulations that require a response to the discharge  such as containment or cleanup  claims by neighboring landowners or other third parties for personal injury  property damage or their response costs and penalties assessed  or other claims sought  by regulatory agencies for response cost or for natural resource damages 
the following are examples of some environmental laws that potentially impact the company and its operations 
water 
the oil pollution act opa was enacted in and amends provisions of the federal water pollution control act of fwpca and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to major oil spills 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and certain other consequences of an oil spill along shorelines or that enters navigable waters 
in the event of an oil spill into such waters  substantial liabilities could be imposed upon the company 
recent regulations developed under opa require companies that own offshore facilities  including the company  to demonstrate oil spill financial responsibility for removal costs and damage caused by oil discharge 
states in which the company operates have also enacted similar laws 
regulations are currently being developed under the opa and similar state laws that may also impose additional regulatory burdens on the company 
the fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters  other oil and gas wastes  any form of pollutant  and  in some instances  storm water runoff  into waters of the united states 
the fwpca provides for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges and  along with the opa  imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation or damages resulting from an unauthorized discharge 
state laws for the control of water pollution also provide civil  criminal and administrative penalties and liabilities in the case of an unauthorized discharge into state waters 
the cost of compliance with the opa and the fwpca have not historically been material to the company s operations  but there can be no assurance that changes in federal  state or local water pollution control programs will not materially adversely affect the company in the future 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
air emissions 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in the caa amendments require or will require most industrial operations in the united states to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emissions control standards developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa and state environmental agencies 
the caa amendments impose a new operating permit on major sources  and several of the company s facilities may require permits under this new program 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes implementation of the caa amendments will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
solid waste 
the company generates non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the epa and the states in which the company operates are considering the adoption of stricter disposal standards for the type of non hazardous wastes generated by the company 
rcra also governs the generation  management  and disposal of hazardous wastes 
at present  the company is not required to comply with a substantial portion of the rcra requirements because the company s operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during the company s operations  could in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal and management requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses by the company 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons in connection with the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner or operator of any site where a release historically occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
in the course of its ordinary operations  the company may have managed substances that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
therefore  the company may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites where the company disposed of or arranged for the disposal of these substances 
this potential liability extends to properties that the company previously owned or operated  as well as to properties owned and operated by others at which disposal of the company s hazardous substances occurred 
the company may also fall into the category of the current owner or operator 
the company currently owns or leases numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
although the company believes it has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released by the company on or under the properties owned or leased by the company 
in addition  many of these properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties who may have disposed of or released hydrocarbons or other wastes at these properties 
under cercla and analogous state laws  the company could be subject to certain liabilities and obligations  such as being required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination

item selected financial data the historical financial data presented in the table below as of and for each of the years in the five year period ended december  are derived from the consolidated financial statements of the company 
significant acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties affect the comparability of the financial and operating data for the periods presented 
the financial results are not necessarily indicative of the company s future operations or financial results

ebitda means income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  plus interest  depreciation  depletion and amortization  exploration expense and impairment of oil and gas properties 
ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the company s industry and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  cash flow provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as a measure of a company s profitability or liquidity 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s results of operations have been significantly affected by its success in acquiring producing oil and natural gas properties 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices have also influenced the company s financial results 
relatively minor movements in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a change in the company s results of operations and cash flow and could have an impact on the company s borrowing base under its bank credit facility 
based on the operating results  a change in the average natural gas price realized by the company of per mcf would result in a change in net income attributable to common stock of approximately million  or per share 
a change in the average oil price realized by the company of per barrel would result in a change in net income attributable to common stock of approximately million or per share

year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales increased million to million in from million in the increase is attributable to a increase in natural gas production and a increase in oil production  offset by lower realized natural gas prices and lower realized oil prices 
the increase in production is attributable to the bois d arc acquisition completed in december other income in decreased  to  from  for this decrease is attributable to a lower level of short term cash deposits outstanding as well as the termination of management fee income previously received by the company

interest expense in increased million to million in from million in the increase is related to a higher level of outstanding advances under the company s bank credit facility due to the bois d arc acquisition completed in december as well as a higher average interest rate on the company s bank credit facility 
the weighted average annual interest rate under the company s bank credit facility increased to in as compared to in the increase in the rate was attributable to a higher utilization of the borrowing base under the bank credit facility after the december acquisition

liquidity and capital resources funding for the company s activities has historically been provided by operating cash flow  debt and equity financings and asset dispositions 
in the company s net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million million before changes to other working capital accounts 
in addition to operating cash flow  the primary source of funds for the company in was aggregate borrowings of million 
the company s primary needs for capital  in addition to funding of ongoing operations  relate to the acquisition  development and exploration of oil and gas properties and the repayment of principal and interest on debt 
in  the company repaid million of indebtedness and incurred capital expenditures of million primarily for development and exploration activities 
the company s annual capital expenditure activity is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands acquisition of oil and gas properties    other leasehold costs   workovers and recompletions    development drilling    exploratory drilling   other  total    the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary with no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company spent million  million and million on development and exploration activities in  and  respectively 
the company currently anticipates spending approximately to million on development and exploration projects in the company intends to primarily use internally generated cash flow to fund capital expenditures other than significant acquisitions and plans to limit drilling expenditures in to available cash flow after debt service payments 
such debt service payments are expected to require a substantial amount of the company s available cash flow unless oil and gas prices improve from current levels 
without an improvement in oil and gas prices or the completion of a debt or equity financing  the company s total capital expenditures will probably be limited to million to million 
the company does not have a specific acquisition budget as a result of the unpredictability of the timing and size of forthcoming acquisition activities 
the company intends to use borrowings under its bank credit facility or other debt or equity financings to the extent available to finance significant acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to the financial condition and performance of the company  and some of which will be beyond the company s control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and gas prices and other market conditions 
the company s bank credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment provided by a syndicate of ten banks for which the first national bank of chicago serves as administrative agent 
indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the company s bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability which is generally redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of the company s oil and gas properties 
as of december   the borrowing base was million and is scheduled to reduce to million by december  and by an additional million by january  such borrowing base may be affected from time to time by the performance of the company s oil and gas properties and changes in oil and gas prices 
the determination of the company s borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
the next scheduled borrowing base redetermination will occur in april  however  the bank group can request a redetermination at any time 
the revolving credit line bears interest at the option of the company at either i libor plus or ii the corporate base rate plus 
the company incurs a commitment fee of up to per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
the average annual interest rate as of december  of all outstanding indebtedness under the company s bank credit facility was approximately 
the revolving credit line matures on december  or such earlier date as the company may elect 
the credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends  limit the amount of consolidated debt  and limit the company s ability to make certain loans  capital expenditures and investments 
significant financial covenants include the maintenance of a current ratio  as defined  to  maintenance of tangible net worth million  maintenance of an interest coverage ratio to  and a limitation on capital expenditures million 
based on the scheduled borrowing base reductions in  the company has classified million of the amount outstanding under its bank credit facility as a current liability at december  the company plans to reduce its drilling expenditures in as compared to and utilize cash flow generated from operations to reduce outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility 
the company believes that it will generate sufficient operating cash flow during to reduce the amounts outstanding under the bank credit facility in accordance with the scheduled reductions to the borrowing base 
the company intends to refinance the additional million reduction to the borrowing base scheduled to occur in january with a future debt or equity financing or to pay down such debt from proceeds from sale of existing properties 
management cannot be assured that such debt or equity financing will be available for the company on the terms acceptable to its existing shareholders or that the banks will not require additional reductions to the borrowing base in the future 
based on estimated oil and natural gas production  the company estimates a change in the average natural gas price realized by the company of per mcf on unhedged production would result in a change in cash flow of approximately million 
also  the company estimates a change in the average oil price realized by the company of per barrel on unhedged production would result in a change in cash flow of approximately million 
if oil and gas prices were to fall significantly below current levels for the remainder of or if the banks were to further reduce the company s borrowing base  the company would likely have to complete a debt or equity financing or sell selected properties in order to meet the required scheduled reductions to its borrowing base 
the company may consider additional debt or equity financings in order to provide liquidity and working capital for attractive acquisition opportunities during the current depressed price environment of the industry 
based on the current low oil and gas price environment  there can be no assurance that such capital would be available with terms and conditions acceptable to the company or its existing stockholders 
federal taxation at december   the company had federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million 
the nol carryforwards expire from through the value of these carryforwards depends on the ability of the company to generate federal taxable income and to utilize the carryforwards to reduce such income 
inflation in recent years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations or financial condition 
risk management the company s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and interest rates 
therefore  the company periodically uses commodity price swaps to hedge the impact of natural gas price fluctuations and uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on floating rate debt 
the company does not engage in activities using complex or highly leveraged instruments 
these instruments are generally put in place to limit risk of adverse natural gas price or interest rate movements  however  these instruments usually limit future gains from favorable natural gas price or lower interest rates 
recognition of realized gains or losses are deferred until the underlying physical product is purchased or sold 
unrealized gains or losses on derivative financial instruments are not recorded 
the cash flow impact of derivative and other financial instruments is reflected as cash flows from operating activities 
as a result of certain hedging transactions for natural gas the company s average realized natural gas price has been impacted as follows year ended december  percent of natural gas production hedged price realized without hedging per mcf increase decrease in price realized per mcf as of december   the company had no open derivative financial instruments held for price risk management 
subsequent to december   the company entered into natural gas price swaps covering  mmbtus of its natural gas production for march to october at  mmbtus per month at a fixed index price of after basis adjustment  which represents approximately of the company s estimated gas production for that period 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  expected maturity date fair value as of total december  in thousands liabilities bank credit facility      variable rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed   average pay rate average receive rate year year  or the ability of computer systems to process dates with years beyond  affects almost all companies and organizations 
computer systems that are not year compliant by january  may cause an adverse effect to companies and organizations that rely upon those systems 
the company is assessing and correcting the potential impact of problems with computer software  operating systems  and equipment containing computer processing chips that are unable to properly process dates beyond the company has outsourced its significant financial information systems 
based on information received from the company s providers  the company is relying on assurances from the providers that they are year compliant 
the company s costs related to year have not been significant and it expects future costs will not be material 
because the company outsources its information technology systems and software  it believes that there is little risk associated with year for its information systems 
the company believes that there is minimal risk with embedded technology associated with its operations because it does not own any significant gas processing plants or pipelines  nor does it have any significant electronic field data capture systems on its wells 
however  the company cannot provide assurance that all significant third parties will achieve compliance in a timely manner 
such failure to achieve year compliance could have an adverse effect on the company s operations and cash flow due to potential shut in production or delay in drilling schedules 
although the company does not have a formal contingency plan  it stands ready to switch from vendors that are not year compliant
