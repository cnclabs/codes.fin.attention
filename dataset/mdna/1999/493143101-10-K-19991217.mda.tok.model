introduction the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries design  manufacture and sell process automation systems  integrating electro optical inspection and sorting  specialized conveying and process and preparation equipment 
the ownership structure of the company s european operations is held through its wholly owned domestic subsidiary  key technology holdings usa  llc 
suplusco holding bv is a wholly owned european subsidiary of key technology holdings usa  llc and in turn owns key superior usa in fiscal  key superior bv was formed through the merger of key technology bv and superior bv  suplusco holding bv s former subsidiaries 
suplusco holding bv and its subsidiary are located in beusichem  the netherlands 
additionally  the company has a wholly owned foreign sales corporation fsc subsidiary  key technology fsc  inc  through the maintenance of which a portion of the company s domestically originated foreign trade income is exempt from tax at the corporate level 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended september   and  the company s net sales were million  million  and million  respectively 
net sales in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal the increased sales in fiscal resulted principally from a million or increase in specialized conveying systems followed by a increase in process and preparation systems and a increase in service contracts and parts 
sales of automated inspection systems increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in sales during fiscal for both the specialized conveying systems and the process and preparation systems resulted principally from sales of larger turn key processing line systems 
these turn key processing lines incorporate the company s conveying and processing systems together with other third party supplied equipment into entire processing lines 
the increase in sales of service contracts and parts in fiscal compared to was principally the result of the introduction early in fiscal of a new multi level service product offering named uptime 
the increase in sales of automated inspection systems resulted principally from increased sales of accuscan r and adr systems  partially offset by decreased sales of tegra systems 
sales of automated inspection systems to european and other international customers increased by 
net sales in fiscal decreased by compared to fiscal the decreased sales in fiscal resulted principally from a decrease in specialized conveying systems followed by a decrease in process and preparation equipment  partially offset by a increase in automated inspection systems and an increase in service contracts and parts sales 
the decrease in specialized conveying systems and other processing equipment occurred principally from decreased sales of these products to domestic customers compared to the increase in sales in of automated inspection systems resulted principally from increased sales of adr systems and  to a lesser amount  increased sales of pharmaceutical systems partially offset by a decrease in total tegra sales for the period compared to fiscal the decrease in total sales volume of the company s tegra automated inspection systems in fiscal was due principally to decreased sales of monochromatic tegra systems  which were partially offset by increased sales of color and multi spectral systems 
the majority of the company s tegra sales are for systems configured with color cameras  which the company believes provides superior detection of defects in most applications 
the company continues to develop new applications utilizing the tegra system as a technology platform 
it believes that systems configured with color and multi spectral cameras will result in growth in automated inspection system revenues in fiscal as the advantages of this technology become more widely known and as sales to more recently developed application market niches increase 
export and foreign sales accounted for  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the largest market for such foreign sales in each if the three fiscal years was to european customers

gross profit was  and of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the gross margin improvement  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  benefited from improved margins in the automated inspection and specialized conveying systems and in service contracts  partially offset by decreased gross margins in process and preparation systems 
automated inspection system gross margins  as a percent of sales  improved six percentage points  principally the result of a decrease in warranty costs 
improved specialized conveying system gross margins benefited principally from a decrease in manufacturing overhead resulting from increased production volumes between the two comparable periods 
the gross margins for service contracts also improved principally as a result of decreased overhead expenses as a percentage of revenues  which increased significantly in fiscal compared to process and preparation system revenues in fiscal included a variety of third party supplied equipment and installation services which were sold at very low margins as components of larger processing lines 
during fiscal  the third party supplied products accounted for approximately million of the million in total net sales of process and preparation systems and were the principal cause of the decrease in gross margins for that product group 
sales of this product group during were million and included minimal third party supplied products 
the improved gross profit margin  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulted principally from a shift in product mix toward higher margin products combined with improved margins in most product groups 
the improved gross margin in also benefited from decreased warranty and installation expenses and decreased manufacturing labor and other manufacturing costs as percentages of sales 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively

research  development and engineering expenses decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased by approximately compared to principally as a result of in increased level of engineering costs charged to cost of sales as a direct result of the increased sales volume  particularly in the company s scs business unit 
however  research and development expenses related to new product development projects increased by in fiscal compared to as a result of activities devoted to developing a new fourth generation adr product and new specialized conveying system products 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal compared to resulted from activities to extend the capabilities of tegra into other applications and markets  such as coffee and tobacco  and in the development of a new product for the potato industry 
additional research and development expenditures were incurred in in the development of an adaptation of the company s vis ir multi spectral scanning cameras that simultaneously uses visible and infrared illumination for detecting defects in french fries while ignoring the potato skin 
the company expects that research and development expenses in fiscal may increase moderately compared to fiscal activities in fiscal will focus on continuing to extend the capabilities and applications of the technologies contained in tegra  completing the development of the fourth generation adr product for the potato industry and continuing to develop new specialized conveying system products 
the company also expects to invest research funds in new technologies related to the quality and safety of foods in the meat and poultry processing and fresh cut produce markets 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and represented  and of net sales in each such year  respectively

the increase in net earnings in fiscal compared to resulted principally from the increased gross margins due to the increased level of sales  decreased warranty expenses  and decreased manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales 
the increased gross margin in fiscal was partially offset by increased selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal in spite of decreased sales volume in fiscal compared to  net earnings in fiscal improved over the prior year due to increases in gross margin resulting principally from a shift in product mix toward higher margin products  improved margins in most product groups  decreased warranty and installation expenses  and decreased manufacturing labor and other manufacturing costs as percentages of sales 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled million compared to million provided by operating activities in fiscal and net cash used totaling million in fiscal during fiscal  cash used due to an increase in accounts receivable totaled million and resulted principally from an increase in sales volume  compared to cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable totaling million during fiscal  due principally to a decrease in sales volume and improved accounts receivable management

the company s facility with a domestic commercial bank provides for an operating line of credit up to million 
the company also maintains a credit facility with a dutch bank providing for operating lines of credit totaling up to approximately  which are available to the company s subsidiaries in the netherlands 
at september   the company had no borrowings under either of these credit facilities 
the company s operating  investing and financing activities during fiscal resulted in decreases in cash and cash equivalents totaling  compared to increases totaling million in and decreases in totaling  the balance of cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million and million at the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and available borrowings under its operating lines of credit will be sufficient to provide for its working capital needs and to fund future growth 
year conversion the company has substantially completed an enterprise wide program to prepare its computer systems  applications and products for the year date conversion 
the company has incurred internal staff costs as well as consulting expenses  investments in capital equipment and other remediation expenditures related to enhancements necessary to achieve a year date conversion with no effect on customers or disruption to business operations 
the total cost of compliance and its effect on the compan s future results of operations continues to be determined as a part of the detailed and on going compliance planning program 
management currently believes that total expenditures for the company s year compliance program will range between  and  including both capital equipment and operating expense 
expenditures through september  totaled approximately  the company s year assessment program that addresses internal issues for its domestic operations was substantially completed by january based on the assessment program  management believes that the year date conversion related to internal issues poses only a low level of risk 
the company s european operation s year assessment and compliance program was substantially completed by september  the company also expects to continue its assessment of external issues related to suppliers  customers  utilities and other third parties 
these activities are expected to continue throughout calendar and beyond  as applicable 
the company assigns a higher level of risk to such issues since they are outside of its immediate control 
the company has identified its supplier base as a primary third party risk element 
in that regard  management has assessed the year compliance status of the sources of supply for its raw material and purchased component inventories 
this assessment has indicated that the company may need to purchase and stockpile selected inventory components  as a contingency measure  in advance of their typical delivery lead times 
although the ultimate requirements for  and value of  such advance inventory purchases will be subject to a number of factors  management currently estimates that it has placed orders with its vendors for inventory valued in a range of  to  delivery of these inventory items is expected during the first quarter of fiscal prior to december  the company also has issued purchase orders for additional inventory in the approximate amount of  which will be stocked and maintained by selected key vendors as buffer contingency stock 
the company has developed contingency plans to assure the uninterrupted date rollover and integrity of its computer information systems  the maintenance of its facilities and equipment in the event of year utility outages or severe weather conditions and the provision of emergency maintenance support services to the company s customers 
the company expects to implement other contingency plans as the requirements for such plans are identified 
the costs  if any  for any additional contingency plans which the company may identify are expected to be incremental to the company s estimated year compliance program expenditures 
the euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union  including the netherlands  established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign legacy currencies and the euro  leading to the adoption of the euro by these countries as their common legal currency 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro from the date of adoption until january  the company continues its assessment of the effect  if any  that the adoption of the euro by these countries will have upon its business 
the terms of sales to european and other international customers of products manufactured by the company s domestic operations have typically been denominated in us dollars  although exceptions do occur on an individual case basis 
the company expects that its standard terms of sales to international customers  other than those in europe  will continue substantially in their present form 
however the company does expect to increasingly price and denominate its products sold to european customers in euros 
for sales transactions between international customers and the company s domestic operations which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  the company assesses its currency exchange risk and may enter into a currency hedging transaction to minimize such risk 
at september   the company was not a party to any currency hedging transaction 
the company does not believe that it should experience a material effect on its business as a result of the euro conversion which would be inherently different than risks that currently exist 
the terms of sales to european customers by key superior  the company s european subsidiary  are typically denominated in either dutch guilders or the respective legacy currencies of its customers 
key superior s information systems software currently accommodates such multiple currency transactions and is expected to integrate euro denominated transactions with relatively minor difficulty 
the company s european subsidiary began implementing a conversion of its business systems to the euro concurrent with the start of the company s fiscal year  well before the january  deadline 
the company s european subsidiaries maintain long term credit facilities with a dutch bank and also long term facility and equipment leases  all of which currently specify periodic debt service or lease payments denominated in dutch guilders 
it is the company s current understanding that no modifications to these agreements will be required since the guilder to euro conversion rate has been fixed and no other changes are expected in the other terms of the respective agreements
