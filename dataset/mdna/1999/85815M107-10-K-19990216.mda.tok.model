item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements contained in this section are forward looking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
because such statements include risks and uncertainties  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  risks associated with the integration of businesses following an acquisition  competitors with broader product lines and greater resources  the termination of any of the company s significant contracts or the company s inability to attract and retain highly qualified management  technical and sales personnel 
general over of the company s revenues are generated from the sale of hardware 
sales to customers within the government accounted for of dunn s revenues in fiscal the company s operating results are characterized by a number of factors resulting from its emphasis on the government market 
for example  the company has historically experienced fluctuating quarterly results due to uneven purchasing patterns of government customers relating to the government s budgetary cycle 
consequently  sales for the first and fourth quarters typically account for the greatest proportions of revenues each year 
in addition  the company s government contracts  which frequently provide for fixed prices  often have initially low gross margins which will increase over the term of a contract due to cost savings from technological improvements and shorter component life cycles 
since most of the company s government contracts have day delivery terms  the company attempts to limit its inventory risks by purchasing components to fill firm orders under fixed price contracts 
the company s most significant costs are components used in the manufacture of desktop  portable and server systems 
with the combination of dunn and idp  the company has been able to realize reduced component costs because of increased volume discounts 
the company s business during fiscal was significantly impacted by the idp acquisition which was consummated on may  as a result of the acquisition  the company s revenues tripled as the company benefited from the addition of the idp customers 
offsetting this increase in revenue were relatively higher operational costs associated with integrating idp s operations which were initially absorbed by the company following the idp acquisition 
the company has taken a number of measures to consolidate and integrate the idp operations with those of dunn so as to reduce the company s operating costs 
such steps have included a reduction in staff  the consolidation of manufacturing operations in the sterling  virginia facility  and the elimination or merger of duplicative operations 
the company has recognized certain costs associated with its consolidation and integration plan as liabilities assumed in the idp acquisition 
these costs were recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price of idp and therefore are not reflected as expenses in the company s results of operations 
these liabilities totaled  and were comprised of employee severance costs of  and facilities related costs of  the severance costs were recorded for idp and primo employees to be terminated due to the integration and consolidation of the company s operations 
the facilities related costs include costs associated with the excess production and warehouse capacity at idp s gaithersburg  maryland facility and an estimate of costs to be incurred once that facility is entirely vacated 
to date   of costs have been charged against these liabilities 
the company does not expect any significant adjustment to these liabilities as its consolidation and integration plan is substantially complete 
in addition  the company incurred  in costs associated with the consolidation and integration plan which were recognized as expenses during fiscal these costs included compensation and severance costs of  and facilities related costs of  the compensation and severance costs were for employees of the company who were terminated as a result of the consolidation and integration plan 
the facilities related costs were costs of certain functions at idp s gaithersburg  maryland facility that were relocated to the company s sterling facility subsequent to year end 
although the company will incur certain costs associated with expanding its operations at its sterling facility  the company believes that the cost cutting measures it has put in place will significantly reduce its operating costs and bring its gross profit margin closer to its level prior to the idp acquisition 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully implement its consolidation and integration plans or that profit levels will increase

year issues recently  national attention has focused on the potential problems and costs resulting from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
while the company believes that its internal software applications and the software in the systems it sells are year compliant  there can be no assurance until the year that all systems will function adequately 
further  if the software applications of others on whose services the company depends are not year compliant  such noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the year problem can be corrected either through software programming or the application can be ported to a client server network 
the company believes with its technical services and its client server hardware product line  it provides year solutions 
in response to the year problem and the associated risks  the company has developed a comprehensive compliance program to evaluate  address and remedy the date related problems with respect to the company s internal systems  third party relationships  and company products and services 
the compliance program is managed by the company s director of engineering  and is tailored after the guidance promulgated by the general accounting office gao in their publication  year computing crisis an assessment guide and by the department of the navy year action plan 
the company has adopted the following five phase approach that was endorsed by the gao and recognized by the us congress awareness phase 
the company s management is familiar with the scope of the year impact  the problem is defined  compliance standards are established and an overall strategy is developed 
a year program team is organizing and implementing the company s year compliance program 
assessment phase 
the year team determines the impact on the company s systems  tools  products and contracts 
the team creates an inventory and evaluation of systems that support the core business sectors 
third party service providers are contacted concerning their compliance with the year problem with regard to the products and services they provide 
the team then prioritizes the conversion or replacement of existing systems that are confirmed to be year non compliant 
renovation phase 
the year program team rectifies the problems discovered in the assessment phase by modifying or replacing systems that are year non compliant 
validation phase 
the renovated or replaced systems  applications and databases are tested and certified as year compliant 
implementation phase 
the renovated or replaced systems are fully implemented and extensive testing is performed to insure coordination with other systems and databases 
backup and recovery plans are put in place 
the company anticipates that it will have all internal year solutions in place by july  internal solutions include information technology systems such as local and wide area network systems and non it systems such as embedded micro controllers within facility  security  telephone and others systems 
the company is assessing the status of third parties with which it has a material relationship 
third parties include vendors and suppliers of essential hardware  software and services and company customers who may fund year compliance efforts in lieu of contracting services to the company 
the company is assessing the status of its products and year related services 
all products sold via the gsa schedule are year compliant 
other products developed and sold by the company are being assessed for year compliance 
the company also performs year related services for both government and industry and is assessing the potential risk to the company of performing these services and is taking action to mitigate these risks as they are identified 
contingency plans 
the company currently is developing contingency plans 
the company anticipates that its internal systems will be year compliant by july  the year readiness of third parties with which the company has a material relationship and their products and services are being assessed 
the company will continue to develop contingency plans as required to mitigate the effects of delays  if any  in internal systems compliance  third party business interruption  non compliant company products and risks associated with providing year related services 
cost for year compliance 
the company estimates that the total cost for year compliance will be approximately  as of january   the company has spent approximately  on year compliance 
year risks 
the company expects to fund the remaining aspects of its program with cash on hand or internally generated cash 
the company believes that its year compliance plan is a comprehensive one and that all internal systems  including both information technology systems and non information technology systems  will be compliant by the end of calendar the company  however  may not be able to identify or remedy all year compliance issues with respect to its internal systems  suppliers  customers  products and services 
as a result  the year problem could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
