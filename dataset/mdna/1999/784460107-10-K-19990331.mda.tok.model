a price increase for all models was implemented during the fourth quarter  however its impact on annual revenues was not significant 
the sales revenue increase is attributed to the decrease in sale units of the lower priced trek model that were offset by increased units of the relatively higher priced renegade 
the renegade began shipping in consolidated gross profit margins decreased million or and decreased as a percentage of sales to from in a number of factors led to this decrease 
the new class a renegade model sales contributed to sales growth 
however  the profit margins of this coach were low  due to the higher costs of introduction and production startup

as discussed in item under the manufacturing section  the company was unable to obtain all of the medium duty transmissions necessary to meet its initially planned production schedule 
in response to this  the company shifted its production to its higher end models which use a heavy duty transmission which was in available supply 
this shift resulted in lower than planned unit sales  but higher sales dollars per unit 
the company believes that the lowered overall unit sales volume was also reflective of increased competition in compared to the company believes that its overall market share of the high line motor home market dropped slightly from the prior year  and it continues to monitor the performance of each of its model lines in relation to the competition 
consolidated gross profit margin increased  or and increased as a percentage of sales to from in a number of factors led to the overall increase in consolidated gross profit margin 
on the positive side  in the prior year  gross margin was negatively impacted by the company s start up operations at midwest 
this facility was shut down in resulting in an overall million positive impact on gross margin compared to the prior year 
additionally  sales of beaver product continue to became a larger portion of the overall sales mix 
since most of beaver s products sell at higher average prices than the safari models  and the company s products generally achieve a greater gross margin on higher priced products  the increase in beaver sales in contributed approximately an additional  to gross margin compared to on the negative side  gross margin was negatively impacted by the company s start up of hco and cti  which reduced gross margin by approximately  compared to the start up phase was completed in during which time extra costs for set up and training of the labor force were incurred

the company recorded a pre tax restructuring expense of million in the fourth quarter of no further restructuring expense was required in given the factors affecting gross margin and selling  general  and administrative expenses  and the impact of the restructuring charge from  operating income increased million or to million from million in as a percentage of sales  operating income was of sales in compared to of sales in interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was due to higher overall borrowings on the company s revolving lines of credit during compared to higher borrowings were required during the first half of the year when finished goods inventory levels were higher than expected due to the slower than anticipated sales demand described above 
production rates were lowered later in the year  and sales also increased  which resulted in reducing the finished goods inventory and the substantial payoff of the short term borrowings  however  the net impact for the year was higher interest expense compared to the company s effective tax rate was  resulting in an income tax provision of million compared to an effective rate of and an income tax provision of million for net income after tax increased  or to million from s net income after tax of million 
inflation the company does not believe inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
factors affecting future operating results the company s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
short term fluctuations in operating results may be caused by a variety of factors  including the relatively high unit cost of the company s motor coaches  the timing of orders from dealers  dealer cancellations of orders  the repurchase of coaches from dealers  new product introductions  production delays and the timing of trade shows and rallies 
because the company s gross profit is generally greater with respect to its more expensive coaches  changes in the product mix of coaches sold can affect the company s operating results 
over longer periods  the cyclical nature of the recreational vehicle industry  changes in interest rates and changes in the level of discretionary consumer spending may also adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be predicted with certainty  and the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
the company believes that the high line motor coach market is much less volatile than the rv industry as a whole  and believes buyers purchasing high line products are making lifestyle decisions largely independent of factors such as the state of the economy or interest rates 
high line coach sales have increased every year since  while the sale of all class a motor coaches have seen both increases and decreases during this period

most dealer purchases of motor coaches from the company are financed under flooring financing arrangements between the dealer and a bank or finance company 
under these flooring arrangements  the financing institution lends the dealer all or substantially all of the wholesale purchase price of a motor coach and retains a security interest in the coach purchased 
these financing arrangements provide that  for a period of time after a coach is financed generally to months  if the dealer defaults on its payment or other obligations to the lender  the company is obligated to repurchase the dealer s inventory for the amount then due from the dealer plus  in certain circumstances  costs incurred by the lender in connection with repossession of the inventory 
the repurchase price may be more than the resale value of the coach 
the company s contingent liability under its repurchase obligations varies from time to time

year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year to be in year compliance a computer program must be written using four digits to define years 
as a result  in less than two years  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company has completed its evaluation of both information technology systems it and non it systems to determine year compliance 
non it systems typically include embedded technology such as microcontrollers 
for most of the company s it systems  year compliance issues have been identified and a remediation plan has been developed 
many of the company s it systems have been made year compliant or require insignificant costs to become year compliant 
the company estimates its costs for software and hardware upgrades to its systems to total approximately  the company spent approximately  for the year ending december  for system upgrades to make its primary it system year compliant 
additionally  the company has begun to evaluate the readiness of its significant suppliers  financial institutions and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those parties failing to remediate their own year issues 
until additional information about such parties is received  the company cannot complete that phase of its year assessment 
to date  the company has not received notice of or become aware of a material year deficiency by a significant vendor  financial institution  or customer 
at this time  the company believes total costs incurred in responding to other parties year computer system deficiencies  together with the cost of any required modifications to the company s internal systems  will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
this analysis may be modified as the company receives responses to inquiries from its significant vendors  financial institutions and customers 
while the company expects that the year will not pose significant operational problems  delays in the installation of the new systems or upgrades to existing systems  or a failure of its vendors  customers or financial institutions to become year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to address this contingency  the company is in the process of developing a risk management plan which will be completed and tested during
