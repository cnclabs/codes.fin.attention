at december   the company was not in compliance with a restrictive covenant of its existing credit facility and  accordingly  the entire principal amount outstanding is presented in current maturities of long term debt 
the amount outstanding under the credit facility as of december  was  on march  the company signed a preliminary agreement with compass bank to restructure its existing credit facility 
the preliminary credit agreement will allow the company to be in compliance with all covenants upon execution of the agreement 
the preliminary agreement provides for a borrowing base facility of  with monthly reductions of  on april  and may    on june  and  on july  and each month thereafter 
semi annual borrowing base determinations will be made beginning july  based in part on the company s oil and gas reserve information 
the maturity date for amounts drawn under the borrowing base facility is february  interest on such facility is based on libor plus and rates are set on specific draws for one  two  three or six month periods at the option of the company 
the preliminary agreement also establishes a tranche a facility in the amount of  the maturity date for the tranche a facility is december  the tranche a requires that excess cash flow from operations  as defined in the preliminary agreement  be applied to outstanding principal and interest until the maturity date  with interest based on the compass bank index rate plus 
the preliminary agreement requires the net proceeds of asset sales be used to extinguish outstanding principal and interest under the borrowing base facility and tranche a 
additionally  under the terms of the preliminary agreement  the company may not make any distributions or pay dividends  including dividends on any class of its preferred stock  until tranche a is paid in full 
additionally  budgeted capital expenditures are required to be approved by the lender prior to closing  and such approval shall be effective for a period of six months or until such time as an increase is requested 
furthermore  provided actual capital expenditures do not exceed the approved budgeted amount  the determination of capital expenditures is at the sole discretion of the company

the terms of the company s series a preferred stock provide that the company will not incur additional debt after such time as it reports financial results which show the company s stockholders equity to be less than the liquidation preference of the series a preferred stock 
as of december   the company s stockholders equity was approximately million and the liquidation preference on the outstanding shares of the series a preferred stock was approximately million 
as a result  the company is unable to incur additional debt under its credit facility or from other sources at the present time 
due to the company s existing current working capital deficiency  required pay downs under its credit facility and the restrictions imposed by the series a preferred stock  management is exploring a number of alternatives that are directed toward making the company profitable and improving its liquidity 
the principal strategies include raising additional capital through the issuance of equity securities  or a combination of equity and subordinated debt  acquisition of value enhancing oil and gas properties that offer additional development opportunities and increased cash flow  mergers and or acquisitions by other entities  reducing operating costs  sale of certain oil and gas properties  renegotiation or amendment of the company s credit facility and capital structure as with any plan of this nature  its ultimate realization will depend upon the cooperation of creditors  potential investors and others 
as a result  the outcome of the plan cannot presently be determined and no adjustments related to the specific considerations of management s plan have been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
should the plan not be completed  the company may not be able to liquidate liabilities as they come due 
in addition  the company s current liquidity situation and its agreement with compass bank have resulted in a suspension of new drilling expenditures until such time as certain aforementioned principle strategies have been effected 
quarterly cash dividends the company announced on march  that it has suspended payment of its regular quarterly cash dividend on both classes of its preferred stock 
this measure was taken to conserve cash for corporate and operating purposes and was precipitated by the recent drop in commodity prices 
the company has no plans to reinstate the cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
year the company is in the process of assessing the ability of its various electronic operating systems  and those of significant third parties  to appropriately consider periods and dates after december  the company s senior financial management has taken responsibility for identifying  addressing and monitoring its year issues 
these individuals report to the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis 
for company systems identified as not being year compliant  the company has developed plans to correct these systems and expects to be compliant on the systems by the second quarter of as for third parties with which the company has a material relationship  the company is in various stages of discussions and conclusions related to the ability of those third parties to become compliant and the related timing thereof 
the estimated costs associated with becoming year compliant are not expected to be material to the company 
the company has begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance timely 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
the company currently plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning by the second quarter of the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company s year efforts are expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the various above mentioned tasks as scheduled  the possibility of interruptions to normal operations should be significantly reduced 
stock listing the company was notified by the new york stock exchange that it is not in compliance with certain of the exchange s minimum financial criteria for listed companies 
the company submitted a three year business plan to the exchange in response to the notice 
the exchange accepted the company s business plan and will monitor its compliance with the plan on a quarterly basis 
as described above  the company s liquidity situation may make it difficult for the company to adhere to this business plan 
if the company fails to do so  there can be no assurance that the new york stock exchange will not delist the company common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk debt and debt related derivatives the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its short term and long term debt with variable interest rates million at december  
based on the overall interest rate exposure on variable rate debt at december  a hypothetical change in the interest rates would not materially affect the company s financial position  net income or liquidity 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding reserve estimates  planned capital expenditures  future oil and gas production and prices  future drilling activity  the company s financial position  the ability to become year compliant  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the company 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revisions of such estimate and such revisions  if significant  would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include changes in oil and gas prices  changes in regulatory or environmental policies  production difficulties  transportation difficulties and future drilling results 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors
