item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the company has historically engaged in providing information technology and staffing services engineering  technical  and airport management to agencies of the united states government  government prime contractors  and local government agencies 
to broaden its existing information technology and staffing services business  the company acquired a commercial outsourced staffing services company in august during the past four years  the company  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  has invested more of its corporate resources in expanding its wireless communications products business area 
this effort has resulted in comarco realizing the majority of its operating income from this business area 
summarized financial information by business segment for the company s fiscal year  which ended january   is as follows information wireless technology communications and staffing corporate and products services other total dollars in thousands revenues    operating income    identifiable assets     o wireless communications products the company s wireless communications products business  through its subsidiary  comarco wireless technologies  inc  is presently comprised of four product families test and measurement  revenue assurance  callbox systems  and portable device power adapters 
o the test and measurement marketplace is covered by the ltx product family used to monitor network performance  the x family used to solve complex engineering problems  and the baseline tm family used to benchmark competitors 
these products provide a method for monitoring  analyzing  and benchmarking the performance of wireless system networks of a customer s competitor  as well as that of its own network 
o the revenue assurance marketplace is covered by rap tm to automate call through testing and to verify the accuracy and integrity of the billing system 
o the callbox systems marketplace is covered by a number of callbox products that provide emergency service over wire line and wireless backbones 
in addition to providing the callbox product  comarco wireless technologies also provides project installation and long term maintenance services 
in october  the company purchased certain callbox product line assets from gte 
the installed base purchased from gte consists of over  units  of which approximately  are being serviced by the company under long term maintenance contracts 
in addition  in february  the company acquired certain assets of the cubic communica tions  inc callbox product line 
the installed base purchased from cubic communications consists of approximately  units 
management believes that the combination of these two product lines establishes the company as a major vendor to this niche of the wireless applications products marketplace 
o universal power adapters for cellular phones  laptop computers  personal assistants and other portable devices are under development  and market trials are in progress 
if market trials are successful  the company plans to continue its investment in this marketplace 
comarco wireless technologies revenues increased to of the company s total revenue in fiscal year  representing an increase of over the prior fiscal year 
operating income increased year to year and represented over of the company s consolidated operating income for fiscal year continued growth in comarco wireless revenues and income is predicated on a number of factors  including the continued success of the company s product development efforts  continued geographical expansion to international markets  continued growth and increased availability of cellular and other wireless communications services  including pcs  in the united states and internationally  and continued acceptance of the company s products by its customers  none of which can be assured 
international revenues in fiscal year totaled million  down from million in the prior fiscal year 
year to year decreased international revenue is due to lower activity in asia due to the general economic conditions and lower activity in europe due to one large order in fiscal year the majority of these sales have been made to europe  asia pacific and latin america 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to be a key area of growth  although the activity may continue to be weak in the near term 
marketing and post contract customer support offices are opened and staffed in singapore  england  and mexico 
product development the company continues its product development program in its wireless communications business 
because a common thread of technology runs through all comarco wireless product lines  the company believes that it can leverage its investment and maintain the focus and concentration of its technical and marketing resources  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company in general has been developing and plans to continue to develop products that will be compatible with all wireless communications air interfaces worldwide 
new product introductions this year included adding other air interfaces to the company s line of test and measurement and revenue assurance products including cdma  gsm  pc  and is  further expansion of the company s lt line with the introduction of the lt  and the release of the baseline tm range of products which represents state of the art technology in comparative network analysis 
the baseline tm product also includes comarco wireless innovative q mos tm technology  which permits wireless carriers to assess the audio quality of their networks and compare it directly with that offered by competing carriers 
the company s wireless product life cycle is estimated to be two to five years  depending on the product 
the company is also continuing its development of a new product line  a power adapter for laptop computers and cellular telephones 
the objective of this product is to be smaller  lighter and more versatile than existing products on the market and is based on the company s patented power conversion technology 
the company commenced market trials including limited sales of the first version of this product in fiscal year  with a more powerful version currently under development 
potential customers are replacement market buyers and original equipment manufacturers 
the company s market trial is focused on replacement market buyers 
the power requirements of laptop computers are increasing due to the introduction of more powerful microprocessors and more advanced battery technologies 
this requires the company to continue its product development program to increase the power capacity of its power adapter products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in bringing the higher power adapter product to market  or that this product will be successful 
the company is aware that the power supply market is extremely competitive 
if the company is successful  the production  marketing  and sale of this product will require a significant amount of working capital for the financing of inventory and accounts receivable arising from sales of the product 
the company plans to continue to invest substantially in product development efforts 
its products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving standards  and continuous improvements in products and services 
the company s future prospects will depend in part on its ability to enhance the functionality of its existing products in a timely and cost effective manner and to identify  develop  and achieve market acceptance of new products that address new technologies and standards and meet customer needs in the wireless communications marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to technological advances  changes in customer requirements  or changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards  and any significant delays in development  introduction or shipment of products  or achievement of acceptable product costs  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of its product development program  the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications business 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  the company s wireless communications business capitalized approximately million and million of software product development costs  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
of the amounts capitalized  million and million  respectively  were amortized in fiscal years and against product sales in accordance with statement no 
in addition  during fiscal years   and  comarco wireless had expenditures of 
million  million and million  respectively  for research and development expenses including company sponsored software development costs prior to determination of technological feasibility  for product design and development expenses  as well as design expenses associated with component replacements  reducing the cost  and improving the manufacturability of existing products 
the reduced fiscal year research and development expenses are due to the transition of the universal power adapter development to initial production and market trial shipments during the year 
backlog unfilled orders at comarco wireless as of january  are approximately million  compared to million as of january  the current year balance includes million of product orders for the test and measurement and revenue assurance product lines  and million of deferred revenue for basic and extended warranty commitments 
the current year balance also includes million of product orders for the power adapter product line 
management believes that substantially all of this backlog amount of million will result in revenue during fiscal year in general  most of the company s product orders are filled within months from the receipt of the order 
the remaining unfilled orders of million are related to the callbox product line 
this backlog balance consists of million of new product orders  million of long term maintenance agreements  and the remaining million is to upgrade the los angeles county callbox system to comply with the americans with disabilities act s requirements for use by hearing and speech impaired individuals 
the company currently expects the majority of the los angeles contract to be performed in fiscal year seasonality fluctuation in quarterly results comarco wireless has experienced  in each of the past five years  a seasonal fluctuation in wireless communications products activity  with greater sales in the latter half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half of the fiscal year  although this trend has been declining over the same five years 
this fluctuation may or may not continue due to a number of factors  including the timing  cancellation  or delay of customer orders  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  the deployment schedule of wireless network operators in both north american and international markets  which can be delayed by both economic and political issues  the size of customers capital budgets  which are the traditional source of customer funding for the purchase of the company s products  market acceptance of the company and its customers products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  capacity and production constraints associated with single source component suppliers  and other competitive factors 
therefore  the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
marketing  sales distribution  foreign sales comarco wireless maintains its own internal sales force for the marketing and sales of the company s product offerings in the united states 
in addition  the company has opened and staffed direct sales and customer support offices in singapore  england  and mexico to service asia pacific  europe  and latin south america  respectively 
the international offices manage a network of agents and distributors for the coordination of sales activity outside of the united states 
this expansion overseas faces a number of inherent barriers  including the need for export licenses  tariffs and other potential trade restrictions  changes in laws governing the imposition of duties  quotas  taxes  or other charges relating to the import or export of its products  political and economic instability  the difficulty of administering business globally  longer accounts receivable cycles  and currency exchange fluctuations 
the company currently has limited experience in penetrating the foreign marketplace and  therefore  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have a competitive advantage over the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s international sales efforts will be successful 
the company currently sells to its major customers under purchase orders that are usually placed with short term delivery requirements 
therefore  the company maintains significant inventory levels and associated production and technical staff in order to respond to the short term delivery requirements 
if the customer orders  as forecasted  do not materialize or are delayed  the company will have higher levels of inventory than otherwise needed  increasing the risk of obsolescence 
the higher levels of inventory and production and technical staffing would also reduce the company s liquidity and profitability 
the company s standard terms require foreign customers to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
as such  a strengthening of the us dollar as compared to a foreign customer s local currency effectively increases the cost of the company s products for that customer  thereby making the company s products less attractive to that customer 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  the company may limit its exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
such activity to date has been insignificant 
there can be no assurance that a currency hedging strategy will be successful in avoiding exchange related losses in the future 
significant weakness in foreign currency exchange rates can also create economic uncertainty  including weakness in banking systems and equity markets 
such weaknesses can impact customers demand for the company s products and their ability to pay for the company s products with us dollars 
therefore  any significant change in a foreign country s exchange rates  economy  or a deterioration of us trade relations or the economies or political stability of foreign locations in which the company sells its products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company is still in the process of receiving its iso certification  a uniform worldwide quality control standard  on its headquarters and manufacturing facility located in irvine  california 
customers and potential customers throughout the world  particularly in europe  may require that their suppliers be iso certified 
in addition  some customers may require that their suppliers purchase components only from subcontractors that are iso certified 
therefore  the company s current status could have an impact on its ability to successfully compete in the international marketplace 
service and warranty the company s warranties vary by product type and typically cover defects in materials and workmanship 
warranty obligations and other maintenance services for the company s products are primarily performed by the company at its facilities in california 
the company currently has service employees located in singapore  england  and mexico to service their respective geographical regions 
capital requirements comarco wireless working capital needs primarily consist of the cost of the upfront product development effort required to expand the company s product offerings  inventory requirements  including long lead time materials  and the financing of accounts receivable  which will generally become longer upon the company s continued planned geographical expansion into europe  asia pacific and latin america 
certain components used by the company in its existing products are only available from single sources  and certain other components are presently available or acquired only from a limited number of suppliers 
the radio interface devices designed into the company s products are key purchased components whose lack of availability could have a material adverse impact on sales and profits 
in the event that any of its single source suppliers are unable to fulfill company requirements or discontinue the manufacture of a key component  the company would be required to purchase a comparable component from other sources and modify its products to function properly with the replacement component or redesign its products to use other components  either of which could result in delays in production and delivery 
working capital requirements are expected to be financed from operations and the financial resources of the company 
comarco wireless also operates from a single site manufacturing operation 
any material disruption in the manufacturing operations of comarco wireless  whether due to fire  natural disasters  or otherwise  will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
technical requirements comarco wireless is selling its products into a market that is growing rapidly and subject to technological obsolescence  and market timing of product introductions is critical for success 
in the development of new or expanded product offerings  the company s access to the technical design of air interface devices is essential for the company to anticipate and develop compatible wireless communications products 
the inability to obtain the technical designs on a timely basis will have a direct impact on product design and schedule and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
employees as of april   comarco wireless employed approximately employees 
the company believes its employee relations to be good 
the majority of the company s employees are professional or technical personnel having training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
the company s future success depends in large part on the continued service of its key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees as well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
recognizing this reality  the company has instituted a long term incentive stock option plan for key comarco wireless employees  whereby they will directly participate in the success of comarco wireless see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company obtains its employees through a variety of means including advertisements  technical job fairs  engineering recruiters  and engineering temporary staffing firms 
competition comarco wireless competes in small niches test and measurement equipment  revenue assurance equipment  and emergency roadside callboxes of the wireless communications marketplace 
the business is competitive and there are other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources  who provide or could provide the same type of products 
the ability of the company to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including the rate at which customers accept the company s products in overseas markets  product quality and performance  experienced sales and marketing personnel  rapid development of new products and features  evolving industry standards  and the number and nature of the company s competitors 
the company believes there are companies that provide or have the ability to provide the products the company is planning for overseas users 
also  companies having a presence or already doing business overseas may have an advantage in penetrating those markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future  either domestically or internationally 
proprietary information the company has three patents for its small power adapter for laptop computers and cellular telephones  and patents covering its emergency roadside callbox product 
however  the company currently relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights to protect its intellectual property in the wireless communications products area 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation or impede third party development of its technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be sold do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
o information technology and staffing services revenue these services are primarily in the fields of o information technologies o intelligent instrumentation and automated test systems o ordnance and weapon systems engineering services o airport management services o commercial staffing services o manufacturing training approximately million or of the company s revenues  and approximately million of its operating income for the fiscal year ended january  were derived from contracts and subcontracts for such services

specializing in both manual and automated electronics interconnection methods  the company offers certification and operator training in accordance with the commercial standard  ipc a backlog the company s backlog from information technology and staffing services revenue believed to be firm as of january  was million  compared to million as of january  the source of backlog is primarily contracts with the us and local governments 
government contracts normally have a base and option periods totaling three to five years in duration 
in many instances  government entities must issue work orders  delivery orders  or task orders prior to the company commencing work 
these entities have the discretion to terminate any contract at their convenience  and are normally obligated only to pay for costs incurred to date under a contract 
in addition  these entities may elect to remove funding previously attached to a contract 
many of the company s contracts are multi year  with options to provide services for additional periods of time 
there can be no assurances that the government entities will exercise the options  will not withdraw funds already committed  or that the entities will fund the unfunded portions of the company s contracts 
it is estimated that approximately of the firm backlog will be realized in fiscal year government contracts a significant portion of the company s total revenues approximately in fy  in fy  and in fy was derived from contracts with the united states government  principally agencies of the department of defense 
significant portions of the company s fiscal year revenues were derived from contracts with the us military services department of defense   us army   us navy   and us air force  
should changes in procurement policies or reductions in government expenditures occur  revenue and net income of the company could be adversely affected see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s government contracts business is not seasonal  however variations may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
further  the federal government is increasing its use of general services administration multiple award schedules gsa mas and other very broad based contract vehicles to acquire information technology related services 
the company has responded to this shift in its federal government market by successfully obtaining awards of its own gsa mas in february and teaming with other companies on similar vehicles they have obtained 
as of april  orders under these vehicles total approximately million since september in the course of the company s business  its contracts are periodically opened for competition 
in march  the company announced the award of a five year government contract three year base period with two one year options with an estimated value of million to continue to provide engineering and management services to the us navy at crane  indiana 
contract periods are generally three to five years  including options 
the company s airport management services contract at reagan washington national airport ended on september  the company decided not to pursue the recompete of this contract since it was marginally profitable  and it would have been unprofitable if reawarded to the company 
the company plans to aggressively compete for its existing work and selectively pursue other high value government procurements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be selected and awarded work under any future proposals 
competition approximately of the company s information technology and staffing services business is awarded through competitive procurements 
government contracting services industries consist of thousands of companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than the company  who can provide the same type of services 
the business is highly competitive 
the company obtains much of its business on the basis of submitted proposals to new and existing customers 
competition generally centers on price  past performance  technical capability  management plan  and personnel 
there is no single company that competes directly with the company on all of the company s services and products 
proprietary information the united states government has certain proprietary rights in software programs and products developed by the company in its performance of government contracts 
seasonality the company s information technology and staffing services business in general is not seasonal  although the summer and winter holiday seasons affect revenue of the company because of their impact on the company s labor sales 
variations in the company s business may also occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new contracts obtained 
employees as of april   the company employed approximately full time employees  of which were part of the information technology and staffing services business area

the company is involved in two distinct business areas development and manufacture of wireless communications products and services  and providing information technology and staffing services  including engineering  technical  and airport management services to government and commercial entities 
fiscal year revenues totaled million  up from the prior year 
increased year to year revenue is primarily due to o a increase in sales of the company s wireless communications products  which primarily include various test and measurement  revenue assurance  and emergency roadside callbox systems  o a increase in information technology and staffing services  consisting of a increase in information technology services and a increase in commercial staffing services  offset by a reduction in airport management staffing services due to the completion of the company s contract at reagan washington national airport  which expired on september  this contract contributed million in revenue in the past fiscal year 
operating income for fiscal year increased to million  up from million last year after the effect of a 
million non recurring  non cash charge for the write off of the remaining intangible assets associated with the company s information technology and staffing services software development operation in fiscal year 
before this non recurring charge in fiscal year  operating income was up compared to the same period last year 
increased operating income is primarily due to increased sales of wireless communications systems and the increase in the information technology staffing services business noted above 
wireless communications products wireless communications products revenues increased to million for fiscal year from million for the comparable period last year 
wireless communications products revenues comprised approximately of total company revenues during fiscal year  up from in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to increased sales of the company s test and measurement  revenue assurance  and emergency callbox systems and the initial introduction and market trials of chargesource tm  a universal power adapter 
the rapid growth of cellular and pcs markets  proliferation of digital communication technologies  and the expanding number of telephone carriers have created greater demand for the company s products 
during fiscal year  the company s product introductions included baseline tm  allowing wireless carriers to track the quality of their networks as well as the quality of their competitors systems 
the company s emergency callbox systems also had significant growth in fiscal year  which  management believes  should continue in fiscal year with the recently announced callbox contracts in the los angeles and san francisco markets 
late in the year  the company commenced market trials of its universal power adapter  chargesource tm  which is designed to charge all of the devices needed by a business traveler 
operating income from wireless communications products increased to million  up year to year and comprised approximately of the company s total operating income for fiscal year summary operating results for comarco wireless technologies  inc  the company s wireless communications products subsidiary  are as follows january  january  product sales   cost of products sold   gross margin   percentage indirect costs   operating income   indirect costs include selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as research and development expenses 
the decreased gross margin percentage is due to greater sales of the company s emergency callbox products and market trial sales of the universal power adapter product  which have lower gross margins than the test and measurement and revenue assurance product families 
indirect costs increased 
million or year to year 
selling and general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal year  up from the comparable period last year 
research and development expense and sustaining engineering and product support expenses totaled million during fiscal year  up slightly from the prior fiscal year 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating future revenue from such development efforts 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs and depreciation and amortization for wireless communications products increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
operating income as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal year  compared to for the comparable prior period 
the year to year decrease in operating income percentage is primarily due to lower margin callbox and universal power adapter product lines  as discussed above 
the company is continuing its software product development program in its wireless communications products business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  during fiscal year the company s wireless communications products business capitalized and amortized million and million  respectively  in fiscal year these amounts are in addition to the research and development expense discussed above 
the company s orders for wireless communications products totaled million for fiscal year  compared with million during fiscal year unfilled orders at january  totaled million  of which million is associated with the long term maintenance contracts and million is associated with post contract customer support obligations which has been recorded as deferred revenue 
the company expects that the majority of the remaining unfilled orders of million will result in revenue during fiscal year in october  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop entitled software revenue recognition 
this statement updates sop which was issued in  and it provides guidance on when revenue should be recognized and in what amounts for licensing  selling  leasing  or otherwise marketing computer software 
the provisions of the new statement were applied prospectively in fiscal year the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the financial position or operating results of the company 
the company has experienced fluctuations in wireless communications products activity in each of the past five years  with greater sales in the second half of its fiscal year and lesser amounts in the first half  although this trend has been declining over the same five years 
this trend may or may not continue as the company broadens its wireless communications products offerings 
the nature of the wireless communications products business is inherently unpredictable  sales and profits may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and therefore  period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
information technology and staffing services revenue revenues provided by the information technology and staffing services business totaled million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the increased revenue of year to year is due to a increase in information technology staffing services and a increase in commercial staffing services  offset by a reduction in airport management staffing services due to the completion of the company s contract at reagan washington national airport  which ended on september  this contract contributed million in revenue in the past fiscal year

the company is experiencing a greater percentage of its information technology and staffing services revenue from fixed price and fixed labor rate contracts versus cost reimbursable contracts 
fixed price and fixed labor rate contracts shift more of the performance risk to the company 
therefore  if the company s assumptions or performance do not meet expectations  reduced profits or losses could be realized 
under one multi year fixed price contract  the company is anticipating a contract modification 
the contract is scheduled to end on september   and the company cannot complete the statement of work due to government delays in providing required equipment 
the company has submitted a request for a month extension and additional funding of million

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based upon marketing initiatives which proved unsuccessful in the fourth quarter  the company determined that the expected future cash flows were not sufficient to cover the remaining unamortized intangible assets 
accordingly  the complete impairment of these assets was recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
operating income revenues less direct costs  indirect costs  and depreciation and amortization for information technology and staffing services is down year to year from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease is due to the start up costs of the two new long term airport services contracts as discussed above  as well as a decrease in the profitability of the reagan washington national airport contract due to a reduction in the management fee effective october  net interest income interest income  less interest expense for fiscal year totaled  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is principally due to lower available investable balances year to year along with lower interest rates 
the company s effective tax rate is for fiscal year versus for the previous fiscal year 
the increased effective tax rate is principally due to no current year adjustment of the income tax valuation allowance as well as lower levels of tax exempt interest income 
the overall increase in net income from the prior year is primarily due to the significant increase in sales of wireless communications products at slightly lower operating income margin  partially offset by the decrease in airport services contracts operating income and a higher effective income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources the company signed a loan agreement with a bank effective september   which was last amended effective august  the loan agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility  which expires june  the revolving credit facility is unsecured provided that the company maintains certain covenants 
currently  management anticipates that cash flow will remain at a level which will enable the company to avoid utilizing the credit facility except to support letters of credit and acquisition financing  and that the company will be able to purchase investments on a regular basis 
the company s cash and investment balances averaged million includes highly liquid long term investments with maturities of to months during the fourth quarter of fiscal year however  maintaining such cash balances is predicated on the company maintaining its business base and is subject to the cost of financing new contracts  acquisitions  geographic expansion  software product development costs  and stock re purchases 
during fiscal year  the company s average days sales in accounts receivable have increased  primarily due to increased sales of wireless communications products and a higher percentage of fixed price funding contracts in the information technology and staffing business area which require retainage holdbacks 
several additional key factors indicating the company s financial condition include january  january  current ratio working capital   book value per share the company continued to demonstrate solid financial strength in the above financial factors during fiscal year  primarily due to increased operating earnings from increased sales in both business segments  offset partially from the million stock re purchases during the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  the company generated million of cash flows from operating activities  up sharply from 
million in the prior year

subsequent to fiscal year and through april   the company has re purchased another  shares for an aggregate amount of 
million 
the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial condition of the company see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to satisfy the current and anticipated capital requirements for operations during fiscal year year many computer systems and software products currently in use by businesses and government organizations are coded to accept two digits  rather than four  to specify the year 
such computer systems and software products will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions the year issue 
the company s technical personnel are in the process of assessing the impact of the year issue on the company s products and services 
the company has established a two phase program to complete its year efforts 
the first phase includes planning  inventory  and assessment  the final phase consists of correction  testing  deployment  and acceptance 
the company has divided its efforts into the categories of internal information systems  products  non it systems  business partners  and customers 
the status of each with respect to the company s two phase process is addressed below 
information systems the company has received letters or has completed remediation whereby all of its accounting and manufacturing software has been determined to be year compliant 
the company is completing its inventory of computers and computer peripheral equipment and has determined that a few older units are not year compliant 
these units will be replaced as part of the regular replacement program this year 
remediation efforts on the readiness of the company s internal information systems are expected to be completed by mid products the company has assessed the year compliance of its software based products along with the associated components 
the following detailed actions have been taken to date test and measurement revenue assurance products most software programs have been determined to be year compliant 
for those requiring remediation  a detailed upgrade program has been sent to each customer  and the effort is being coordinated through the company s normal upgrade program 
emergency callboxes the technology acquired from gte has been determined to be substantially year compliant 
changes required are minimal 
the company has assessed the year reliability of the technology acquired from cubic communications and determined that some problems exist  and remedies are being designed 
implementation is being coordinated with each customer as part of its product upgrade program 
the financial impact to the company  if any  cannot be determined until the product upgrade program is completely coordinated with each member of the customer base 
the company believes that the cubic communications technology remediation will be completed by the latter part of other software products over the years  the company has been associated with a modest number of software products 
a review of commercial products has been completed for their year exposure 
the company concluded that year issues related to these products are minimal and that required remediation efforts are insignificant 
the company s program to assess and correct any year issues with its products is well underway  and upgrade programs are or will be in place during to coordinate the efforts involved 
efforts are being coordinated through the company s normal upgrade channels  and at this time no additional resources need to be assigned to the effort 
non it systems non it systems include embedded technology such as micro controllers 
the company s assessment indicated that the equipment utilized in its manufacturing process is not date dependent 
the company has assessed the impact of non it issues on its other office equipment telephone systems  copiers  facsimile machines  etc 
and facility infrastructure for which it is responsible 
responses are being received from the respective vendors  and the company does not expect any significant issues in this area 
the company will continue to assess non it systems and expects substantial resolution by july business partners business partners include  but are not limited to suppliers  the company s bank  insurance and benefit providers  and property management firms 
the company s operations are dependent to varying degrees on the readiness of these and other partners 
the company has issued questionnaires to or has received correspondence from most of the currently identified business partners 
to date  the responses received indicate that many of the company s business partners are actively addressing the year issue 
the company is continuing to pursue responses in order to complete its evaluation 
by mid  the company expects to have identified and developed contingency plans for business partners that cannot give adequate assurances that they will be year ready 
customers the company is contacting its customers to assess the state of their readiness and the potential impact on the company s operations 
the company s main concern is principally with us and state and local government entities 
the primary concern is that there will be delays in contract payments to the company  which would require a temporary increase in working capital funded from bank borrowings 
the company has substantial borrowing capacity available under its current line of credit  which extends to june the company will continue to evaluate the cash flow impact of year issues and develop additional contingency financing plans  if required 
the company will use both internal and external resources to ensure that it is year ready 
the company has not deferred any significant information technology projects as a result of the year effort 
the total cost of the program is being funded through operating cash flows 
the total cost associated with the year effort  except for certain product modifications discussed above  is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
although the company s year efforts are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on the its business and operations  the actual effects of the issue and the success or failure of the company s efforts described above cannot be known until the year therefore  in the opinion of management  the most reasonable likely worst case scenario is the possibility that the company s major business partners  other material service providers  or customers will not adequately address their respective year issues in a timely manner  the effect of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the company will be developing contingency plans with respect to this most likely worst case scenario as additional information is obtained from both business partners and customers 
such plans will not be finalized until mid at the earliest 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income

the company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting financial information about operating segments in annual financial statements and required reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not modify the company s identification of segments and had no impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
as of january   the company had no accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies
