on july  the company entered into a revolving credit facility with coast business credit  a division of southern pacific bank  located in los angeles  california 
pursuant to the credit facility  the company may borrow up to  or such lesser amount as is permitted under various borrowing base formulas 
as of september   under the most restrictive of the borrowing base formulas  there was  of borrowings available to the company  of which  had been borrowed and was outstanding 
the credit facility expires in july and is secured by all assets of the company and the personal guarantee of  from the company s chairman and ceo gordon t 
graves 
the initial application of the funds available under this facility were used to pay  of debt owed to two other banks  approximately  was used for the repurchase of eps owned by the ep llc ii partnership and approximately  was used to relieve outstanding accounts payable  which for the most part included components for the manufacture of class iii video lottery devices and past due legal and professional fees 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  payable monthly  at a rate equal to the greater of or above the prime rate from time to time in effect 
all of the company s revenues are deposited into a blocked account controlled by the bank and disbursements from the blocked account may be made only with the approval of the bank 
in december  the credit facility was amended in connection with obtaining coast s consent to the terms of the settlement of the ngi litigation 
the amendment waives any defaults that may have resulted from the settlement  increases the early termination fee payable by the company in the event the company prepays the credit facility prior to its maturity in july  and requires the company to pay a  fee to coast in consideration for the amendment 
the company believes that its current operations  including the payment of its expected legal fees and expenses  and the payments to ngi under the settlement agreement can be sustained from cash from operations 
the company has adequate inventory on hand to support the assembly and installation of approximately additional eps to further expand the company s interactive gaming operations  requiring little cash from future operations 
in addition  the company has approximately used eps available for use in its rental pool 
to expand interactive gaming operations beyond this  unit level will require funding from external sources 
due to the terms of the credit facility with coast business credit and the settlement agreement with ngi  including the fact that both are secured by all of the company s assets  it is not likely that the company can refinance these obligations from other sources in the forseeable future 
the inability to obtain additional financing when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve its planned objectives as well as any expectations the market might have about the company s future performance 
contingencies for information regarding contingencies  see item litigation 
inflation and other cost factors the company s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by inflation 
however  the company s operational expansion is affected by the cost of hardware components  which are not considered to be inflation sensitive  but rather sensitive to changes in technology and competition in the hardware markets 
in addition  the company expects it will continue to incur increased legal and other similar costs associated with compliance with regulatory requirements and the uncertainties present in the operating environment in which the company conducts its business 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas is effective for transactions entered into after january  fas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in earnings 
because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  adoption of this statement will have not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
impact of year yk the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not yk compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has identified its yk risk in three categories internal business software  interactive game software and tv bingo game show software

the company believes it is in full yk compliance with its internal financial systems for the year however  if due to unforeseen circumstances  the yk implementation is not successful  it could have a material impact on the operations 
accordingly  contingency plans have been established 
the cost of making any adaptations is not expected to be material and would be expensed in the period incurred 
interactive game software the company s interactive games have been configured using the microsoft four digit system which is yk compliant 
all current games and system components have been tested  and all communication services vendors have certified that their systems are yk compliant 
tv bingo game show software printer software and game management software for the tv game show system has been rewritten  tested and installed to achieve yk compliance
