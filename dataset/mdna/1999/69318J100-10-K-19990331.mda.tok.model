except as required by law  the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
readers  however  should carefully review the factors set forth in other reports or documents that the company files from time to time with the sec 
general the company was founded in as a mail order business offering a broad range of software and accessories for ibm and ibm compatible personal computers 
the founders goal was to provide consumers with superior service and high quality branded products at competitive prices 
the company initially sought customers through advertising in selected computer industry publications and the use of inbound toll free telemarketing 
currently  the company seeks to generate sales through i outbound telemarketing by account managers focused on the business  education and government markets  ii inbound calls from customers responding to the company s catalogs and other advertising  and iii the company s internet web site 
in late the company commenced selling products through its internet web site 
the company offers both pc compatible products and mac compatible products 
reliance on mac product sales has decreased over the last three years  from of net sales in to of net sales for the year ended december  although net sales attributable to mac products increased in the year ended december   as compared to the comparable period in  the company believes that such sales will continue to decrease as a percentage of net sales and may decline in dollar volume in and future years 
all of the company s product categories experienced strong growth in the year ended december  with sales of computer systems representing the fastest growing category 
sales of computer systems result in a relatively high dollar sales order  as reflected in the increase in the company s average order size from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  computer system sales generally provide the largest gross profit dollar contribution per order of all of the company s products  although they generally yield the lowest gross margin percentage 
partially as a result of higher system sales  the company s gross margin percentage has declined over the last two years while the operating income margin has increased due to the leveraging of selling  general and administrative expenses over a larger sales base 
the company s profit margins are also influenced by  among other things  industry pricing and the relative mix of inbound versus outbound sales 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products market is very aggressive  and the company intends to maintain prices at competitive levels 
since outbound sales are typically to corporate accounts that purchase at volume discounts  the gross margin on such sales is generally lower than inbound sales 
however  the gross profit dollar contribution per order is generally higher as average order sizes of orders to corporate accounts are usually larger 
the company believes that outbound sales will continue to represent a larger portion of its business mix in future periods 
the direct marketing of personal computers and related products is highly competitive 
in addition to other direct marketers and manufacturers who sell direct  such as dell computer corporation dell and gateway  inc gateway  manufacturers of pcs sold by the company  such as compaq and ibm  have also announced varying plans to sell pcs directly to end users 
separately  both compaq and ibm have announced plans to increase their reliance on reseller arrangements with direct marketers such as the company as part of their own marketing programs designed to compete more effectively with dell and gateway 
the company currently believes that direct sales by compaq and ibm will not have a significant adverse effect upon the company s net sales 
most product manufacturers provide the company with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in the company s catalogs 
although the level of co op advertising support available to the company from certain manufacturers has declined  and may decline further in the future  the overall level of co op advertising revenues has continued to increase consistent with the company s increased levels of spending for catalog and other advertising programs 
the company believes that the overall levels of co op advertising revenues available over the next twelve months will be consistent with the company s planned advertising programs 
in connection with the relocation of its headquarters facility beginning in october  the company incurred certain one time moving and other costs of approximately  which were charged to operating costs 
in connection with the offering of the company s common stock that closed in march  the company reported certain non recurring  non cash items in the year ended december  see initial public offering and pro forma and other adjustments below

for all periods prior to march  described herein  the company elected to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the code  and applicable state laws 
effective march   the closing of the company s initial public offering  the company s s corporation election was automatically terminated  and the company became subject to federal and state income taxes as a c corporation from that date forward 
for the quarter ended march   the income tax provision includes a million tax benefit related to the establishment of additional deferred tax assets for future tax deductions resulting from the termination of the company s subchapter s corporation status 
pro forma net income is determined by i eliminating stockholder officer compensation in excess of the aggregate base salaries  per year and ii by eliminating the actual income tax provision and adding a provision for federal and state income taxes that would have been payable by the company if taxed under subchapter c of the code for all periods prior to march  liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  together with the net proceeds from the offering and available credit under its bank line of credit  will be sufficient to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the company s ability to continue funding its planned growth is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million and million used in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the primary factors historically affecting cash flows from operations are the company s net income and changes in the levels of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
historically  inventories and accounts payable have increased as a result of the sales growth of the company 
accounts receivable have increased primarily due to an increase in open account sales to commercial customers resulting from the company s continued efforts to increase its sales to such customers offset in part by a higher rate of increase in accounts receivable allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts related to the growth in sales 
additionally  receivables from vendors increased due to the increased activity in vendor rebate and other programs 
capital expenditures were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of computer hardware and software and other fixed assets  to be approximately million for the year ending december  as of december   the company had a credit agreement with a bank providing for short term borrowings equal to the lesser of million or an amount determined by a formula based on accounts receivable and inventory balances 
borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventories other than inventories pledged to secure trade credit arrangements and bear interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or libor plus at the company s option 
no amounts were outstanding under this agreement as of december  the credit agreement includes various customary financial and operating covenants  including restrictions on the payment of dividends  except for dividends to stockholders in respect of income taxes  none of which the company believes significantly restricts the company s operations 
at december   the company had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence and will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under security agreements to facilitate the purchase of inventory 
year compliant information systems the change in date from to poses potential problems for many computer and electro mechanical systems around the world 
some of the company s systems could be affected by this problem which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to minimize any potential disruption to the company s business  the company has an active  on going program to evaluate its systems and take corrective action prior to the millennium change 
a full time senior manager is responsible for managing the year project  which is comprised of five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
for each system that is determined to be non compliant  the company is taking one of the following three courses of action to achieve date compliance i renovate convert the current system  ii replace the current system with a new date compliant system  or iii retire the current system because it no longer serves a valid business need 
the company recently replaced its order management and fulfillment software with new software and converted its principal computer equipment to new ibm as platform systems  both of which are better suited to the company s expected scale of operations and are designed to be year compliant 
the company is investigating the extent to which its other systems may be affected and communicating to all of its system vendors concerning timely and completed remedies for those systems requiring modification 
the company currently believes it will be able to modify or replace any affected systems in time to minimize any detrimental effect on operations 
the company is also communicating with all third parties on which it relies to assess their progress in evaluating their systems and implementing appropriate corrective measures 
furthermore  the company is actively encouraging its customers to undertake their own year compliance projects in order to ensure the continued viability of the company s commercial business pursuits 
the company has been taking  and will continue to pursue  all reasonably necessary steps to protect its operations  assets and the interests of its customers  shareholders  employees and community partners 
utilizing both internal and external resources to identify and assess needed year remediation  the company currently anticipates that its year awareness  assessment  renovation and validation efforts  which began in  will be completed by june   and that such efforts will be completed prior to any currently anticipated impact on its computer equipment and software 
the company estimates that as of december  it had completed approximately of the initiatives that it believes will be necessary to fully address potential year issues relating to its computer equipment and software 
the majority of the projects comprising the remaining of the initiatives are in process and expected to be substantially completed by june time percent frame completed status of overall year project awareness assessment renovation validation implementation summary of significant year projects completed conversion to new ibm as conversion to new order management and fulfillment software the primary objectives of the year project relating to the company s internal systems were met when the company implemented its new order management and fulfillment software and upgraded its ibm as data processing platform 
the majority of the costs approximately million of the new software and hardware were capitalized during the period october  to september  the company believes that the costs of its year awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation for all other computer equipment and software  as well as currently anticipated costs to be incurred by the company with respect to year issues of third parties  will not exceed  which will be funded from operating cash flow 
these costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  for all year issues that are not properly identified  or assessments  renovation  validation and implementation are not effected timely with respect to year problems  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or results of operations 
the company is presently undertaking  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with worst case scenarios  and such scenarios have not yet been clearly identified 
the company currently plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning before december  the costs of the company s year awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to assess  renovate and implement all relevant computer codes and embedded technology and similar uncertainties 
in addition  variability of definitions of year compliance and the myriad of different products and services and combinations thereof  sold by the company may lead to claims whose impact on the company is not currently estimable 
no assurance can be given that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims  if any  will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although some of the company s agreements with manufacturers and others from whom it purchases products for resale contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify the company under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification arrangements will cover all of the company s liabilities and costs related to claims by third parties related to the year issue 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires that all companies record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
management is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on the financial statements of the company 
the company will adopt this accounting standard on january   as required 
inflation the company has historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
the company does not expect inflation to have a significant impact on its business in the future 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to continue to successfully market  sell  and distribute computers  hardware and software 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below no assurance of future growth net sales have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this growth has placed increasing demands on the company s management resources and facilities 
the company s business strategy is to pursue additional growth and expand its customer base  which is likely to result in additional demands on the company s resources 
the company s future success will depend in part on the ability of the company to manage any future growth effectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize future growth in net sales or will not experience decreases in net sales 
risks related to transition or expansion of facilities additional and or alternative facilities for distribution and sales may be required to support significant future growth in the company s net sales  if realized 
there can be no assurance that suitable facilities will be available  and in the absence of such facilities  future growth could be impaired 
dependence on management information systems the company s success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability and proper use of its management information systems  including its telephone system  and the information generated by its management information systems 
the company does not currently have redundant systems for all functions performed by its management information systems or a redundant or back up telephone system 
any interruption in these systems or in telephone service could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
rapid technological change and exposure to inventory obsolescence the market for personal computer products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to identify and market products that meet the needs of the marketplace 
in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain favorable purchasing discounts  the company may carry increased inventory levels of certain products in the future  which will subject it to increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
in the implementation of its business strategy  the company intends  among other things  to place larger than typical inventory stocking orders  increase its participation in first to market purchase opportunities  and may in the future participate in end of life cycle purchase opportunities and market products on a private label basis  all of which will further increase the risk of inventory obsolescence 
special purchase products are sometimes acquired without return privileges and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to avoid losses related to obsolete inventory 
in addition  some manufacturers provide the company with co op advertising support in the form of products  for which there may be no return privileges 
finally  certain build to order programs currently being implemented by some computer systems manufacturers will likely include reductions in the levels of price protection and product returns made available by such manufacturers 
see business products and merchandising 
availability and allocation of goods the company acquires products for resale from manufacturers as well as from distributors 
purchases of products from the five vendors supplying the greatest amount of goods to the company constituted and of the company s total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
among these five vendors  purchases from ingram micro  inc ingram micro represented and of the company s total product purchases in the years ended december  and  respectively 
no other vendor supplied more than of the company s total product purchases in the year ended december  the loss of ingram micro could cause a short term disruption in the availability of products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
substantially all of the company s contracts and arrangements with its vendors that supply significant quantities of products are terminable by such vendors or the company without notice or upon short notice 
most of the company s product vendors provide the company with trade credit  of which the net amount outstanding at december  was million 
termination  interruption or contraction of the company s relationships with its vendors  including a reduction in the level of trade credit provided to the company  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business purchasing and vendor relations 
certain product manufacturers either do not permit the company to sell the full line of their products or limit the number of product units available to direct marketers such as the company 
an element of the company s business strategy is to increase its participation in first to market purchase opportunities 
in the past  availability of certain desired products  especially in the direct marketing channel  has been constrained 
the inability to source first to market purchase or similar opportunities  or the reemergence of significant availability constraints  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
reliance on vendor support and relationships some product manufacturers and distributors provide the company with substantial incentives in the form of payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  price protection and rebates 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to receive such incentives in the future or that it will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to any future incentives in a timely manner or at all 
most product manufacturers provide the company with co op advertising support in exchange for product coverage in the company s catalogs 
this support significantly defrays the expense of catalog production 
the level of co op advertising support available to the company from certain manufacturers has declined 
the level of support from some manufacturers may further decline in the future 
such a decline could increase the company s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business purchasing and vendor relations 
competitive risks the company competes with national and international direct marketers  product manufacturers that sell directly to end users  specialty personal computer retailers  personal computer and general merchandise superstores  consumer electronic and office supply stores  and shopping services on television  the internet and commercial on line networks 
the company competes not only for customers  but also for co op advertising support from personal computer product manufacturers 
some of the company s competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial resources  superior operating results  and larger catalog circulations and customer bases than the company 
in addition  several direct marketers have recently been acquired by larger competitors 
this industry consolidation could result in short term price cutting in certain markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with existing competitors or any new competitors that may enter the market  or that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be adversely affected by intensified competition 
see business competition 
pricing risks the personal computer industry has experienced intense price competition 
the company believes that price competition may increase in the future and that such competition could result in a reduction of the company s profit margins 
also  the company has recently increased its sales of personal computer hardware products that generally produce lower profit margins than those associated with software products 
significant margin decreases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
economic risks the market for personal computers and related products has grown rapidly in recent years 
recent statements by industry observers have indicated that there may be a slowdown in the growth rate of the personal computing industry 
if the growth of this market or the direct marketing channel were to cease or decrease  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected 
demand for many of the products carried by the company may be subject to economic cycles 
the company s business and growth could be affected by the spending patterns of existing or prospective customers  a recession or prolonged economic slowdown  the cyclical nature of capital expenditures of businesses  continued competition and pricing pressures and other trends in the general economy  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence on third party shippers the company ships approximately of its products to customers by airborne freight corporation d b a airborne express airborne express  with the remainder being shipped by united parcel service of america  inc and other overnight delivery and surface services 
strikes or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect the company s ability to market or deliver product on a timely basis and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business distribution 
potential increases in shipping  paper and postage costs shipping costs are a significant expense in the operation of the company s business 
the company has a long term contract with airborne express for shipment of its products under which the company believes it has negotiated favorable shipping rates 
the company generally invoices customers for shipping and handling charges 
there can be no assurance that the full cost  including any future increases in the cost  of commercial delivery services can be passed on to the company s customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the current shipping rates under the airborne express contract are subject to renegotiation in  and there can be no assurance that such renegotiated rates will continue to be as favorable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see business distribution and business marketing and sales 
the company also incurs substantial paper and postage costs related to its marketing activities  including its catalog production and mailings 
any increases in postal or paper costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
no assurance of future profitability  variability of quarterly results the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its operating results  and these fluctuations may continue in the future 
the company incurred net losses in the year ended december  the company s results of operations are significantly affected by many factors  including seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for personal computer products and in profit margins on products sold  catalog timing and circulation  product availability  and timing of releases of new and upgraded products 
many of these factors are outside the control of the company 
the company s operating results are heavily dependent upon its ability to predict sales levels  monitor and control associated expenses  and carefully manage all aspects of its operations  including product selection and pricing  purchasing and payables practices  inventory management  and catalog funding  production and circulation 
if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  or if the company experiences difficulty in monitoring or controlling associated expenses  the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter the expectations of public market analysts and investors will exceed the company s operating results 
in such event  the price of the common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see selected quarterly financial results within this section 
changing methods of distribution the manner in which personal computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as on line shopping services  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
certain of the company s vendors  including apple  compaq and ibm  currently sell some of their products directly to end users 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
state sales or use tax collection uncertainties the company presently collects sales tax only on sales of products to residents of the state of ohio 
sales to customers located within the state of ohio were less than of the company s net sales during the year ended december  various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales taxes on the sales of products shipped to their residents 
in  the united states supreme court affirmed its position that it is unconstitutional for a state to impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are limited to the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
however  legislation that would expand the ability of states to impose sales tax collection obligations on direct marketers has been introduced in congress on many occasions 
due to its presence on various forms of electronic media and other factors  the company s contact with many states may exceed the contact involved in the supreme court case 
the company cannot predict the level of contact that is sufficient to permit a state to impose on the company a sales tax collection obligation 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on the company in states to which it ships products would result in additional administrative expenses to the company  could result in price increases to the customer  and could reduce demand for the company s products or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence on key personnel the company s future performance will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of its senior executives 
the competition for qualified management personnel in the personal computer products industry is very intense  and the loss of service of one or more of these persons could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s success and plans for future growth will also depend on its ability to hire  train and retain skilled personnel in all areas of its business  including account managers and technical support personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  train and retain sufficient qualified personnel to achieve its business objectives 
control by principal stockholders patricia gallup and david hall  the principal stockholders of the company  beneficially own or control  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
because of their beneficial stock ownership  these stockholders can continue to elect the members of the board of directors and decide all matters requiring stockholder approval at a meeting or by a written consent in lieu of a meeting 
similarly  such stockholders can i control decisions to adopt  amend or repeal the restated certificate and the company s bylaws  or take other actions requiring the vote or consent of the company s stockholders and ii prevent a takeover of the company by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer their stock to a third party  which could deprive the company s stockholders of a control premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of the company 
such control may result in decisions that are not in the best interest of the public stockholders of the company 
in connection with the offering  the principal stockholders placed all except  of the shares of common stock of the company that they beneficially own into a voting trust  pursuant to which they are required to agree as to the manner of voting such shares in order for the shares to be voted 
such provisions could discourage bids for the shares of common stock at a premium as well as have a negative impact on the market price of the shares of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  the company s credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
the company had no borrowings outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december  the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows should not be material
