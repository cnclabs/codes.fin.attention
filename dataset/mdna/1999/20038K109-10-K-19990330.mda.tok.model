item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion set forth below supplements the information found in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which may be beyond the company s control 
see forward looking statements in item of this report for a discussion of certain of such risks and uncertainties 
overview set forth below are discussions and analyses of financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the company believes that its future operating results may not be directly comparable to historical operating results because of the company s increased size  related cost savings and marketing synergies 
since october  the company has completed acquisitions 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for on a purchase basis and the results of operations of each of the businesses acquired have been included in the company s historical financial statements from the date of acquisition 
certain of these acquisitions provide for contingent payments by the company as a part of the purchase consideration based upon the operating results of the acquired businesses for specified future periods 
the acquisitions were financed by the company principally through its issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowings under credit facilities 
as a result  the company s historical results of operations include bridge financing costs  which are not expected to be incurred in future periods  and preferred stock dividends 
all previously issued preferred stock has been repurchased or redeemed by the company 
in addition  as a result of its rapid growth through acquisitions  the discussion and comparison of the company s historical results of operations set forth below may not be meaningful 
gross margins on staffing services can vary significantly depending on factors such as the specific services being performed  the overall contract size and the amount of recruiting required 
margins on the company s sales in the technical services sector are typically significantly lower than those in the telecommunications  information technology and financial services sectors 
consequently  changes in the company s sales mix can be expected to impact the overall gross margins generated by the company 
staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employee related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  disability and life insurance to its billable employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  often resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company increases revenues through acquisitions and or internal growth  these receivables will grow and there will be greater requirements for borrowing availability under its credit facilities to fund current operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales of services of million for the year ended december  were million  or nearly higher than net sales of services for the year ended december  the increase in net sales of services is attributable principally to the company s acquisition of uniforce on november cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services decrease of for is a result of the company s business mix in that year  which reflected the full period impact of acquisitions completed during as well as growth in the company s information technology  telecommunications and financial services sectors 
these sectors have historically generated higher gross margins than the more mature technical staffing sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this percentage increase was principally attributable to the operations of the company s uniforce subsidiary  which was acquired in uniforce s selling  general and administrative fees  which include significant licensee costs related to its franchise operations  are substantially higher on a percentage basis than those historically recorded by the company 
the licensee costs included in selling  general and administrative fees were million for and million for which included only one month of uniforce s operations 
operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this increase was principally attributable to the company s completion of the rhotech and uniforce acquisitions in the company s interest expense for is attributable to the interest on the credit facility  the coi notes and comforce s senior secured pik debentures the pik debentures  all of which obligations were incurred in november for the year ended december   interest expense is attributable to the million principal amount of the subordinated debentures issued by the company in february and march the old subordinated debentures  the company s credit facilities outstanding during the year and the coi notes and pik debentures issued in november the amortization of the costs payable on the old subordinated debentures is reflected in bridge and financing charges for the income tax provision for the year ended december  was for million on pretax income of million  compared to a tax credit of million on a loss before taxes of million for the year ended december  the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective tax rate relates primarily to state income taxes and the nondeductibility of amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales of services of million for the year ended december  were million  or approximately higher than net sales of services for the year ended december  the increase in net sales of services is attributable principally to the company s completion of six acquisitions since the end of the first quarter of cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services compared to cost of services of for the year ended december  the cost of services increase of is a result of the company s business mix in  which reflected the full year impact of acquisitions completed during as well as expansion in into more mature technical staffing sectors 
these more mature technical staffing sectors historically generate gross margins substantially lower than telecommunications and information technology sectors  principally due to the nature of the related contracts and competition in this sector 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributable to the acquisitions completed during and which contributed increased net sales of services with lower incremental selling  general and administrative costs 
during  the company recorded merger  integration and other non recurring charges totaling million 
these non recurring charges before taxes consist of merger and integration charges resulting from the acquisition of uniforce  and include severance costs of  asset write downs of  and integration costs of  operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  this increase was principally attributable to the company s completion of six acquisitions following the end of the first quarter of and prior to december  for the year ended december   interest expense is attributable to the old subordinated debentures  the company s credit facilities outstanding during the year and the coi notes and pik debentures issued in november bridge and financing charges for the year ended december  are attributable principally to the amortization of bridge finance costs payable on the old subordinated debentures issued by the company in february and march  the proceeds of which were used to partially fund the acquisition of rhotech and for working capital purposes  and the write off of deferred financing fees on a prior credit facility with fleet national bank  which was repaid in november income tax reflects a credit for the year ended december  for million on a loss before income taxes of million  compared to a tax provision of  on pretax income of million for the year ended december  this credit assumes that the company will have taxable income in future periods 
the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate and the company s effective tax rate relates primarily to state income taxes and the nondeductibility of amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company has historically paid its billable employees weekly for their services before receiving payment from its customers 
additionally  certain statutory payroll and related taxes as well as other fringe benefits are generally paid by the company before the company receives payment from its customers 
consequently  a significant portion of the company s cost of services is normally paid by the company prior to receiving payment from its customers 
increases in the company s net sales of services  resulting from expansion of existing offices or establishment of new offices  will require the employment of additional cash resources 
the debt service costs associated with the borrowings under the coi notes and the credit facility have significantly increased liquidity requirements 
the debt service costs associated with the pik debentures may be satisfied through the issuance of new notes 
to date  the company has chosen to issue new notes to pay these costs 
management of the company believes that  based on the results of operations and anticipated growth  including growth through acquisitions  cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness  to fund growth at anticipated levels and to meet anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  various factors  including those described or referenced under forward looking statements in item could prevent the company from realizing these objectives 
as of december   the company had outstanding million in principal amount of pik debentures bearing interest at a rate of  million in principal amount of coi notes bearing interest at a rate of and million outstanding under the credit facility bearing interest at an average rate of per annum 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms of the pik debentures  the coi notes and the credit facility 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total assets were intangible assets 
these intangible assets substantially represent amounts attributable to goodwill recorded in connection with the company s acquisitions and will be amortized over a five to year period  resulting in an annual charge of approximately million 
various factors could impact the company s ability to generate the earnings necessary to support this amortization schedule  including the factors described or referenced under forward looking statements in item the company is obligated under various acquisition agreements to make earn out payments to the sellers of acquired companies  subject to the acquired companies meeting certain contractual requirements 
the maximum amount of the remaining potential earn out payments is million in cash and million in stock payable in the three year period from to the company cannot currently estimate whether it will be obligated to pay the maximum amount  however  the company anticipates that the cash generated by the operations of the acquired companies will provide all or a substantial part of the capital required to fund the cash portion of the earn out payments 
during  the company s primary sources of funds to meet working capital needs were cash from operations and borrowings under the credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the year ended december  cash flows used in investing activities of million were in excess of cash flows provided by operating activities of million and cash flows provided by financing activities of million 
cash flows used in investing activities were principally related to the purchase of camelot consulting group  inc and certain affiliated companies and additions to fixed assets 
cash flows provided by financing activities were principally attributable to net borrowings under the credit facility 
year the company has completed a review of its potential year issues by examining all of its internal and third party applications  operating systems  interfaces and hardware 
independent of its year compliance program  the company initiated a major system conversion beginning in early  based principally on industry leading peoplesoft r software  in order to improve access to business information through common  integrated computing systems nationwide 
the company s conversion to these new systems  which are expected to make the company s it systems fully year compliant  is now approximately percent complete and is expected to be completed during the second quarter of in assessing potential year issues  the company has established a year committee  a compliance program and a budget 
the committee has divided the company s year compliance program into four sections systems inventory and assessment  systems testing evaluation and monitoring  third party suppliers and contingency planning 
systems inventory and assessment has been completed  and the remaining sections are expected to be completed by mid the company expects that all of its it systems and non it systems will be year compliant prior to december  the company estimates the total year expenditures which will be incurred in the future will be less than million 
not included in these costs are the costs of conversion to the new integrated computing systems  which was undertaken independently of its year compliance initiative 
as a part of its year compliance program  the company is in communication with its third party vendors and service providers in order to assess their year readiness and seek to ensure that they will be year compliant 
the company is in the process of advising its vendors that it expects them to provide confirmation of their year readiness during the second quarter of in the event the company does not believe it has received reasonable assurance from its vendors as to year compliance during the second quarter of  the company will seek to establish relationships with vendors that are year compliant 
with respect to the purchases of computer systems  or upgrades for existing computer systems  the company s policy is to receive year certification from the vendor prior to completing the purchase 
the statements above which express the company s belief that year problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company may be forward looking statements 
although management believes that the company has acted with appropriate diligence to address potential year issues  no assurance can be given that year issues will not materially affect its business or operations 
factors which could potentially cause the company to suffer business interruptions or other losses include the failure of its year project team to identify latent or other non compliant codes or technologies  the failure of any of the customers  vendors  service suppliers or financial institutions with which the company deals to address their own year problems or the ineffectiveness of any contingency plans put in place by the company to mitigate the effects of interruptions in its businesses due to year problems 
seasonality the company s quarterly operating results are affected primarily by the number of billing days in the quarter and the seasonality of its customers businesses 
demand for services in the technical services sector has historically been lower during the year end holidays through january of the following year  showing gradual improvement over the remainder of the year 
although less pronounced than in technical services  the demand for services in the telecommunications and it sectors is typically lower during the first quarter until customers operating budgets are finalized 
the company believes that the effects of seasonality will be less severe in the future if net sales of services contributed by the information technology  telecommunications and financial services sectors continue to increase as a percentage of the company s consolidated net sales of services 
other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect the statement to have a significant effect on its current financial reporting and disclosure requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the preponderance of the company s borrowings are fixed rate obligations 
during  only approximately of the company s interest expense was attributable to variable rate loans  all of which were under the credit facility 
consequently  management does not believe that any adjustments to the rate under the credit facility are likely to have a material impact on its results of operations in the immediate future 
the company has not entered into any swap agreements or other hedging transactions as a means of limiting its exposure to interest rate fluctuations
