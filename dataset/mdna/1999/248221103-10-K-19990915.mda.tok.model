in thousands  except per share data basic net income loss per share before extra ordinary item diluted net income loss per share before extra ordinary item impact of year issues some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed the assessment of its computer software  hardware and other systems  including embedded technology  relative to year compliance 
the company s domestic operations have completed the updating of their software and hardware systems to improve the efficiency of their business information systems 
the company s foreign subsidiaries are currently updating their software and hardware in order to improve the timeliness and quality of their business information systems

software selection at these subsidiaries has been completed and implementation has begun with anticipated completion ranging from october to december with this schedule  the year issue is not expected to pose significant operational problems for the company s computer systems 
because conversions for business reasons are leading to year compliance  the company does not expect incremental expense for year compliance 
the company has completed its assessment of key vendors  customers and other third parties and based on this assessment  the company does not anticipate that year issues will have a material impact on the company s operations or financial results 
with respect to suppliers  the company relies on several key suppliers for resin and fiberglass used in its operations  and interruptions in these suppliers operations resulting from year problems could impact the company s operations and financial results

because the company anticipates that it will complete its year remediation efforts in advance of december   it has not made any contingency plans with respect to its operations and systems 
however  if the software changes and modifications of existing software are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
with respect to key suppliers  the company has begun to identify potential alternative suppliers of raw materials in the event that its key suppliers suffer business interruptions as a result of year problems

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on its senior domestic and foreign credit facilities  which includes revolving credit notes and term notes 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either the prime interest rate  libor  or euribor 
under its senior domestic credit facilities  the company may  at its option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor for days to months 
at june  and july   the company had million and million  respectively  outstanding under its senior credit facilities 
based on these balances  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  and  or 
and  net of tax  per diluted share  respectively  on an annual basis 
the company s objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings 
the company also has working capital lines of credit with various financial institutions for several foreign subsidiaries 
these lines of credit are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency 
the majority of these instruments carry interest at a percentage point spread from certain european interest rates  such as libor  pibor and stibor 
at july   the company had million outstanding under these facilities 
based on this balance  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  or  net of tax  per diluted share  on an annual basis 
beginning in fiscal year  the company  through its subsidiary welna  will have manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
in  the company manufactured its products in the united states 
with the addition of welna  the company will have manufacturing and sales facilities in the netherlands  germany  poland  france and the united kingdom 
in addition  the company will also have sales activities in belgium and thailand 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the dutch guilder and the polish zloty and swedish krona non euro countries 
when the dutch guilder strengthens against the polish zloty and swedish krona  the value of non functional currency sales decreases 
when the dutch guilder weakens  the function currency amount of sales increases 
the company does not currently hedge its net investment in foreign operations 
the company has exposure to price fluctuations associated with its primary raw materials  including fiberglass  resin and steel 
the company s supply agreement with a major supplier of fiberglass holds pricing constant for the period from january  through june  and subsequently contains certain stabilizing pricing parameters through its expiration on december  in addition  the company does not have any long term purchase agreements nor does it depend upon any single supplier or source for its resin or steel requirements
