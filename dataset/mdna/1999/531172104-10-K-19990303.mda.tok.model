however  certain data  including the same store comparison  do lend themselves to direct comparison 
this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue principally rental revenue and operating expense reimbursement increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of properties in operation owned during the respective periods 
as of january   the company owned properties and  through december   acquired additional properties and completed development on properties for a total investment as defined below of million and disposed of eight properties for million 
as of january   the company owned properties  and  through december   acquired additional properties and completed the development on properties for a total investment of million  and disposed properties for million 
furthermore  total revenue increased because the operating expense recovery percentage the ratio of operating expense reimbursement to rental property expenses and real estate taxes increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to the increase in occupancy 
the total investment for a property is defined as the property s purchase price plus closing costs and management s estimate  as determined at the time of acquisition  of the cost of necessary building improvements in the case of acquisitions  or land costs and land and building improvement costs in the case of development projects  and where appropriate  other development costs and carrying costs required to reach rent commencement 
rental property and real estate tax expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in the number of properties owned 
property level operating income for the same store properties properties owned since january  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   with straightlining which recognizes rental revenue evenly over the life of the lease  and increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   without straightlining 
these increases of  and  respectively are due to increases in rental rates and increases in occupancy 
set forth below is a schedule comparing the property level operating income  with and without straightlining  for the same store properties for the years ended december  and with straightlining without straightlining in thousands in thousands rental revenue     operating expense reimbursement     rental property expenses     real estate taxes     property level operating income     general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase is due to the increase in personnel and other related overhead costs necessitated by the increase in the number of properties owned during the respective periods 
the increase is somewhat mitigated by the benefit of certain economies of scale experienced by the company in owning and operating the increased number of properties 
additionally  the year ended december  reflects the expensing of internal acquisition costs as of january  in compliance with eitf  whereas these costs of million were capitalized in depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in the number of properties owned during the respective periods 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in the average debt outstanding for the respective periods which was  million in and million in this increase is also due to an increase in the weighted average interest rates for the periods  to in from in as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in addition  income before minority interest increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  total revenue principally rental revenue and operating expense reimbursement increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of properties owned during the respective periods

depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increase in the number of properties owned during the respective periods 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in the average debt outstanding for the respective periods which was million in and million in this increase is partly offset by the lower interest rates on the outstanding debt 
the reduction in interest rates was partially the result of the company receiving investment grade ratings from both standard poor s ratings group s p and moody s investors service  inc moody s during the year which enabled the company to access public debt markets more economically 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in addition  income before minority interest increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to the additional cash flow generated by the greater number of properties in service during the latter period as discussed above under results of operations 
net cash flow provided by operations is the primary source of liquidity to fund distributions to shareholders and for the recurring capital expenditures and re leasing costs for the company s properties 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million decrease was a result of the decrease in net investment in operating properties partially offset by an increase in investment in development and land held for development 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from the issuance of equity and debt net of debt repayments and shareholder distributions

the company funds its acquisitions and completed development with long term capital sources 
these activities may be funded on a temporary basis through its million unsecured line of credit the credit facility  which matures may   and can be extended for one year for  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the company s leverage levels or ratings from moody s and s p 
on june   moody s raised its prospective senior debt rating of the company to baa from ba and on july   s p assigned a bbb prospective senior debt rating to the company 
at these ratings  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility is basis points over libor

the interest rate for the loan is basis points over libor 
general the company believes that its existing sources of capital will provide sufficient funds to finance its continued development and acquisition activities 
the company s need for capital in was somewhat reduced by a decline in acquisition activity  resulting from a general marketplace decline during that period in initial returns on acquisitions

calculation of funds from operations management generally considers funds from operations as defined below a useful financial performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit  because  together with net income and cash flows  funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income or loss after preferred dividends computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and minority interest and excluding significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measurement of the company s performance over time 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
funds from operations for the years ended december    and are as follows year ended december  in thousands income available to common shareholders    addback minority interest    depreciation and amortization    premium on debenture conversion  write off of deferred financing costs  loss gain on sale   funds from operations    year readiness disclosure background in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive computer software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this is generally referred to as the year issue 
if this situation occurs  the potential exists for computer system failures or miscalculations by computer programs  which could disrupt operations 
approach the company has established a group to coordinate the company s response to the year issue 
this group  which reports to the president and chief operating officer  includes the company s mis director  a vice president property management and its general counsel  as well as support staff 
the company is in the process of implementing a year compliance program at the company s offices and properties consisting of the following phases phase compilation of an inventory of information technology it and non it systems that may be sensitive to the year problem 
phase identification and prioritization of the critical systems from the systems inventory compiled in phase and inquiries of third parties with whom the company does significant business ie  vendors  service providers and tenants as to the state of their year readiness 
phase analysis of critical systems to determine which systems are not year compliant and evaluation of the costs to repair or replace those systems 
phase repair or replace noncompliant systems and testing of critical systems 
status the company s property management and accounting system uses four digit year fields and consequently is believed to be year compliant 
phases  and are substantially complete but for the process of following up on inquiries of significant third parties as to their year readiness  which is currently ongoing 
phase is ongoing and will continue through the first half of calendar it is the company s goal to have this project completed by mid based upon the analysis conducted to date  the company believes the major critical systems at the company s properties are currently compliant or will be compliant by mid costs the total cost to the company of making its systems year compliant is currently estimated to be in the range of  the majority of this cost relates to repairing certain software  testing systems and retrofiting or replacing energy management systems at certain of the properties 
the cost for the replacement of the equipment and the software will be capitalized and depreciated over their expected useful life 
to the extent existing hardware or software is replaced  the company will write off the cost incurred 
this write off is included in the above cost estimate 
furthermore  all costs related to software modification  as well as all costs associated with the company s administration of its year project  are being expensed as incurred and are likewise included in the cost estimate above 
risks associated with the year problem the company utilizes computer systems in many aspects of its business 
as noted  the company s property management and accounting systems use four digit year fields and are believed to be year compliant 
additionally  with respect to the hardware and software systems utilized by the company in its management information systems  the company s assessment to date indicates that these systems are year compliant or can readily be made year compliant on a stand alone basis 
testing of this preliminary assessment and of the operation of these systems together is ongoing 
the company also utilizes microprocessors which are imbedded in systems which are part of the building operations eg  microprocessors contained within the buildings energy management systems or fire and life safety systems 
in particular  year problems in the hvac  security or other such systems at the properties could disrupt operations at the affected properties 
the properties generally consist of suburban office and industrial properties 
the properties are also principally single story and low rise buildings 
the company has reviewed its building operating systems on a building by building basis 
at this point  based on the status of its assessment the company does not believe a material number of these systems are non compliant 
additionally  many of these systems  which operate automatically  can be operated manually and consequently in the event these systems experience a failure as a result of the year problem  the disruption caused by such failure should not be material to the company s operations 
the company is also exposed to the risk that one or more of its vendors or service providers could experience year problems that impact the ability of such vendor or service provider to provide goods and services 
though this is not considered as significant a risk with respect to the suppliers of goods  due to the availability of alternative suppliers  the disruption of certain services  such as utilities  could  depending upon the extent of the disruption  have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
to date  the company is not aware of any vendor or service provider year issue that management believes would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that its vendors or service providers will be year ready 
the inability of vendors or service providers to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could have a adverse impact on the company 
the effect of non compliance by vendors or service providers is not determinable at this time 
in addition  the company is exposed to the risk that one or more of its tenants could experience year problems that impact the ability of such tenant to pay its rent to the company in a timely fashion 
the company does not believe that such a problem is likely to affect enough tenants to pose a material problem for the company 
to date  the company is not aware of any tenant year issue that would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that their tenants will be year ready 
the inability of tenants to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could have an adverse impact on the company 
the effect of non compliance by tenants is not determinable at this time 
widespread disruptions in the national or international economy  including disruptions affecting the financial markets  resulting from year issues  or in certain industries  such as commercial or investment banks  could also have an adverse impact on the company 
the likelihood and effect of such disruptions is not determinable at this time 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures regarding forward looking statements previously disclosed 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  and as a result  has not had a significant impact on the company during this period 
the credit facility and certain other indebtedness bear interest at a variable rate  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the credit facility and such other indebtedness will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes or utilities  substantially all of the tenant s leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources and inflation 
the interest on the credit facility and such other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rate for variable rate debt was basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense net of amounts capitalized would have been increased or decreased by approximately million 
if interest rates for fixed rate debt maturing and to be refinanced in is basis points higher or lower than its current weighted average rate of  the company s interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates  the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
