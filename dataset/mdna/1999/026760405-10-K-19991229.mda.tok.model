overview the company currently operates through two subsidiaries 
the first  isp channel  inc isp channel is a leading provider of high speed internet access over cable to both residential and commercial customers while the second  intellicom  provides two way broadband satellite connectivity to a wide variety of business customers  the majority of whom are rural isps which use intellicom s service to connect from remote points of presence  through intellicom s network operations center in livermore  california  to the internet 
isp channel is currently one of intellicom s larger customers and  as of december  of the systems deployed by isp channel  utilized intellicom s service in preference to terrestrial lines such as ts 
on july   softnet entered into a letter agreement with mediacom llc  one of the top ten cable operators in the us  which was formalized in definitive agreements dated november  under the agreements  the company will issue to mediacom an aggregate million shares of common stock in exchange for mediacom entering into an affiliate agreement of up to years but with a year minimum with isp channel that provides for mediacom delivering to isp channel  two way upgraded homes passed on a minimum schedule of  homes each months over the first three years of the contract 
in the event that mediacom fails to deliver the agreed number of homes within the contractual time period  a portion of the stock issued to mediacom will be returned to the company 
in the event that mediacom acquires or upgrades more than  two way homes  then both parties are obligated to extend the original agreement on similar terms for such incremental homes subject to a cap on the total aggregate number of shares that the company is obligated to issue to mediacom 
in addition  mediacom gained the right to nominate one member to the company s board of directors  who shall be rocco commisso  mediacom s chairman and chief executive officer 
on december   the company received a million investment from hong kong based  pacific century 
this investment followed an earlier announcement in october whereby pacific century and the company agreed to form a joint venture that  save for certain exceptions  would offer services similar to those currently provided by isp channel to cable operators throughout asia 
these exceptions comprise certain components  including content and connectivity  which will  in general  be provided by either pacific century or the company directly to the cable operator 
at this time  the company has signed a memorandum of understanding with pacific century outlining the areas of business this joint venture will pursue 
the company is in the process of drafting definitive agreements and establishing the strategy  business plan and operational processes of this joint venture 
the revenue for isp channel comprises i monthly access fees received from cable modem customers  ii one off installation charges  iii revenue from cable modem rental and sales  and iv revenue generated by traditional dial up isp services and business services 
revenue generated through the cable modem business is generally split equally with the cable operator though isp channel takes a higher split for the first customers on any given system and is reported in our financial statements net of the portion paid to the cable operator 
the revenue for intellicom comprises i monthly fees paid by users of the satellite service on a per vsat basis  ii vsat related equipment sales  iii revenue from sub leasing of excess satellite transponder space and iv data center processing fees 
the last category represents legacy business that intellicom exited at the beginning of fiscal to focus on its core business of providing high speed internet access using two way satellite technology 
while intellicom receives revenue from isp channel in return for satellite services  such revenue is not reported as it is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales is reported as a single line item and primarily consists of the cost of connectivity for both isp channel and intellicom 
within isp channel  these costs include the links between the cable headends where it has systems deployed and a central office of the public switched telephone network  links between the central office and isp channel s network operations center in mountain view and  in the case of one way cable systems where the return path from the customer to the cable headend is through a dial up connection  the cost of telephone lines into the headend 
it is isp channel s intention to minimize further deployments of one way systems  however  due to the higher cost to the company in providing such service and the fact that the customer offering is substantially less compelling than in a two way system 
intellicom s principal cost of sales comprises satellite transponder fees 
currently  the company has transponder space on two satellites  ge and satmex  both of which provide coverage over the continental united states and beyond 
the company reports operating expenses in several categories i selling and marketing includes  in addition to the costs of selling and marketing the company s services to end users  customer care  content production  and cable partnering costs  ii engineering which includes the costs of maintaining and manning the network operations center  field engineering and information technology  and iii general and administrative costs 
amortization primarily comprises the write off of the cost of launch incentives which are paid to cable operators  usually in the form of stock in the company  to enter into long term contracts with the company 
these payments are amortized over the life of the contract between the cable operator and the company 
compensation expense relates to stock options granted between october and march although these options were granted at the then fair market value of the company s common stock at the time of grant  the underlying option plan was not formally approved by the stockholders of the company until april   the date of the company s annual meeting 
under apb  the company must recognize as a charge the difference between these various grant prices and  the closing price on the date of stockholder approval of the stock option plan 
this charge  totaling approximately million  will be recognized as a non cash charge amortized over a vesting period of approximately four years

year issues many computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this poses a problem at the end of the century because such computer programs would not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of 
this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations that could disrupt the company s business 
the company has formulated a year yk plan the yk plan to address the company s yk issues and have created a yk task force headed by the director of information systems and data services to implement the plan 
the company s yk plan has six phases organizational awareness educate the company s employees  senior management  and the board of directors about the yk issue 
inventory complete inventory of internal business systems and their relative priority to continuing business operations 
in addition  this phase includes a complete inventory of products and services  critical vendors  suppliers and services providers and their yk compliance status 
assessment assessment of internal business systems and external customers including cable affiliates  critical vendors  suppliers and service providers and their yk compliance status 
planning preparing the individual project plans and project teams and other required internal and external resources to implement the required solutions for yk compliance 
execution implementation of the solutions and fixes 
validation testing the solutions for yk compliance 
the company s yk plan will apply to two areas internal business systems compliance by external customers and providers during the course of addressing all yk issues  the company also added remediation and contingency planning processes 
internal business systems the company s internal business systems and workstation business applications will be a primary area of focus 
the company is in completing the implementation of new enterprise wide business solutions to replace existing manual processes and or home grown applications during these solutions are represented by their vendors as being fully yk compliant 
the company has few  if any  legacy applications that needed to be evaluated for yk compliance 
the company completed the inventory  assessment and planning phases of substantially all critical internal business systems 
the execution and validation phases have begun 
the company expects to be yk compliant on all critical internal business systems before december  but in any event  the company will have contingency plans in place to continue critical business operations should some part of the internal business systems fail 
some non critical systems may not be addressed until after january however  the company believes such systems will not cause significant disruptions in the company s operations 
compliance by external customers and providers the company has substantially completed the inventory phase and are in the final stages of the assessment phase with the company s critical suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent to which the interface systems are susceptible to those third parties failure to remedy their own yk issues 
to the extent that responses to yk readiness responses have been unsatisfactory  the company is working with these parties to remediate the issues 
the company has been in discussions with the company s cable affiliates with regard to the status of their yk readiness 
cable affiliates representing over of our cable based internet customers have provided written or verbal assurances of their yk readiness 
however  there can be no guarantee that the yk compliance efforts of any of the company s cable affiliates will be fully successful 
risks associated with yk the company believes a major risk associated with the yk issue is the ability of the company s key business partners and vendors to resolve their own yk issues 
the company has spent a great deal of time over the past several months working closely with suppliers and vendors to assure their compliance 
however  should any problems occur the company may lose significant revenue and incur unanticipated expenses to remedy the problem and such problems could divert management s time and attention  any of which could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operation and financial condition 
to the extent any of our cable affiliates experience yk failures  the company s internet service customers could experience an interruption or total or partial failure of service 
should this occur  the company could lose significant revenue as a direct result of the yk failure or indirectly due to the loss of customers  either of which could have material effect on the company s business results of operations and financial condition 
costs to address yk issues because the company is implementing new enterprise wide business solutions to replace existing manual processes and or home grown applications  there will be little  if any  yk changes required to existing business applications 
all of the new business applications implemented or in the process of being implemented in are represented as being yk compliant 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project  which costs are principally related to payroll costs for the company s information systems staff 
the external costs  primarily consultants  has been approximately  through november  and it is estimated that the company will spend an additional  on its remediation and contingency plans 
contingency plan the company has formulated a contingency plan which includes maintaining staffing during the most critical times during which the company might experience yk failures 
in addition  the company will have field personnel on standby to assist cable affiliates and vsat customers should assistance be required if the interface systems fail 
however  the company s contingency plan can not address problems should its cable affiliates fail to be yk compliant 
summary there can be no assurance  that the systems of the company s customers  other companies or government entities  on which the company rely for supplies  cash payments  and future business  will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by the company s customers  other companies or government entities  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
further  if  due to yk issues  third party suppliers  service providers and contractors fail to provide the company with components  materials  or services which are necessary to deliver the company s service and product offerings  with sufficient electrical power and transportation infrastructure to deliver the company s service and product offerings  then any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business  as well as the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company is continuing to seek verification from the company s cable affiliates  critical suppliers  service providers and contractors that they are yk compliant 
to the extent that any of these business partners fail to be yk compliant  it may have a significant impact on the company s business 
should the company s internet service customers or vsat customers fail to be yk compliant  it may have a significant impact on the company s revenues 
the company s inability to correct a significant yk problem  if one exists  could result in an interruption in or a failure of  certain of the company s normal business activities and operations 
in addition  a significant yk problem concerning the company s cable modem internet services or the company s vsat services could cause the company s users to consider seeking alternate providers of internet services 
any significant yk problem could require the company to incur significant unanticipated expenses to remedy the problem and could divert management s time and attention  either of which could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operation and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income the company can earn on its investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense the company must pay with respect to its various outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities  which are tied to market rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities 
we had short term investments of million at september  these short term investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between three and eighteen months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by percent from levels at september  would cause the fair value of these short term investments to fall by an immaterial amount 
since we are not required to sell these investments before maturity  we have the ability to avoid realizing losses on these investments due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
on the other hand  declines in the interest rates over time will reduce our interest income 
we had outstanding convertible debt instruments of approximately million at september  these instruments have fixed interest rates ranging from to 
because the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates will not have a material effect on us 
increases in interest rates  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowing by us  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
equity price risk we own  shares of common stock of convergent communications  inc these shares were obtained as partial consideration with respect to the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  kansas communications  inc at september   the closing price of convergent s common stock was  as listed on the nasdaq stock exchange 
as a result  we value this investment on our balance sheet at september  at its market value of  unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
we do not hedge against equity price changes
