in  the company made a strategic decision to dispose of the bakery by products recycling segment

the company has credit available under the revolving credit facility to cover its presently foreseeable capital needs  assuming it continues to meet the certain financial covenant tests under the amended and restated credit agreement dated january   which were adjusted downward to reflect the sharp decline in the prices the company received for its finished products meat and bone meal  yellow grease and tallow in such prices continued to decline early in the company is implementing a plan to modify its business operations in light of the continued low prices for its finished goods

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year readiness since many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors collectively  business systems use only two digits to represent the year  these business systems may be unable to accurately process certain data before  during or after the year as a result  business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year issue 
the year issue can arise at any point in the company s supply  manufacturing  distribution and financial chains 
the company began work on the year compliance issue in the scope of the project includes ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on pc and lan platforms  addressing issues related to non it embedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance of key suppliers and customers 
the project has four phases assessment of systems and equipment affected by the year issue  definition of strategies to address affected systems and equipment  remediation or replacement of affected systems and equipment  and testing that each is year compliant 
with respect to ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on the company s various computer platforms  the assessment phase and definition of strategies phase have been completed 
it is estimated that of the remediation or replacement phase has been completed with the balance of this phase expected to be completed by mid the testing phase of existing applications operating systems and hardware not being remediated or replaced has been completed 
with respect to addressing issues related to non it embedded software and equipment  which principally exists in the company s manufacturing plants  the assessment phase and definition of strategies phase are expected to be completed by the end of second quarter testing began in  and remediation and replacement is expected to be completed by the end of third quarter  if needed 
the company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials  water  utilities  transportation and other key services 
interruption of supplier operations due to year issues could affect company operations 
we have initiated efforts to evaluate the status of our most critical suppliers progress 
this process of evaluating our critical suppliers is scheduled for completion by mid options to reduce the risks of interruption due to suppliers failures include identification of alternate suppliers where feasible or warranted 
these activities are intended to provide a means of managing risk  but cannot eliminate the potential for disruption due to third party failure 
the company is also dependent upon customers for sales and cash flow 
year interruptions in customers operations could result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels  and cash flow reductions 
the company is in the assessment phase with respect to the evaluation of critical customers progress and is scheduled for completion by mid contingency the company is in the process of developing contingency plans for those areas that are critical to our business 
these contingency plans will be designed to mitigate serious disruptions to our business flow beyond the end of  where possible 
the major efforts related to contingency planning are scheduled for completion by the end of the third quarter of costs the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project 
such costs  however  are principally the related payroll costs for the company s information systems group 
the company has incurred approximately  in related internal expenses to date 
future expenses are expected to be approximately  such cost estimates are based upon presently available information and may change as the company continues with its yk project 
all estimated costs have been budgeted and are expected to be funded through cash flows from operations 
these costs do not include any cost associated with the implementation of contingency plans  which are in the process of being developed 
risks the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in the annual report on form k  including  without limitation  the statements under the sections entitled business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and legal proceedings and located elsewhere herein regarding industry prospects and the company s financial position are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectation reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include the company s continued ability to obtain sources of supply for its rendering operations  general economic conditions in the european and asian markets  and prices in the competing commodity markets which are volatile and are beyond the company s control  and the year readiness issue 
future profitability may be affected by the company s ability to grow its restaurant services business and the development of its value added feed ingredients  all of which face competition from companies which may have substantially greater resources than the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the principal market risk affecting the company is exposure to changes in interest rates on debt 
the company does not use derivative instruments  exclusive of interest rate swaps 
while the company does have international operations  and operates in international markets  it considers its market risks in such activities to be immaterial 
the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge adverse interest rate changes on a portion of its long term debt 
at january   the company had million notational value of interest rate swaps outstanding 
these swaps effectively changed the interest rate on million in long term debt to a fixed rate through the period ending june  assuming year end fiscal variable rates and average long term borrowings for fiscal  a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by million  net of the effect of swaps
