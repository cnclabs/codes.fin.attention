item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sapient corporation sapient or the company is an innovative provider of integrated management consulting services  internet commerce solutions and systems implementation services 
using a proven  fixed price model designed to ensure on budget and on time delivery  sapient offers a variety of integrated services to help clients rapidly achieve their critical business objectives 
founded in as a delaware corporation  sapient has experienced consistent revenue growth in each of the last eight years 
the company currently has more than  employees in offices in cambridge  massachusetts  new york  san francisco  chicago  atlanta  dallas  los angeles  portland maine and london  england 
sapient delivers most of its services using its proprietary discipline called quadd quality design and delivery 
quadd is a highly disciplined  integrated methodology that involves active client participation and is designed to rapidly deliver business applications that improve processes and performance 
the quadd process consists of four stages rip workshop  design  implementation and production 
the rip rapid implementation plan workshop is designed to rapidly identify the client s needs and develop a strategy and action plan to meet those needs 
the design workshop focuses on outlining the proposed process changes and required information technology solutions 
the implementation stage primarily involves the development and testing of the new solution or enhancements to a third party packaged software application or existing sapient developed solution 
the production stage primarily involves the maintenance  enhancement and support of the solution after it is operational 
while the quadd process is designed as an integrated approach  each stage represents a separate contractual commitment and concludes with the delivery of a discrete value added deliverable 
clients are able to elect at each stage whether to proceed to the next stage of the process 
sapient s revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the number  size and scope of projects in which the company is engaged  the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects  any delays incurred in connection with a project  employee utilization rates  the adequacy of provisions for losses  the accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  general economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  revenues from a large client may constitute a significant portion of the company s total revenues in a particular quarter 
on august  the company acquired studio archetype for approximately million in stock and cash  including direct acquisition costs of approximately million  pursuant to which the company issued  shares of sapient common stock and paid  in cash to the former studio stockholders 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
on april   sapient completed a public offering of common stock which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
proceeds to sapient  net of underwriting discounts and costs of the offering  were approximately million 
on january   sapient declared a two for one stock split effected as a stock dividend paid on march  to all stockholders of record on february  sapient s financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the effect of the stock dividend 
on december   sapient acquired all of the outstanding common stock of exor in exchange for  shares of sapient common stock 
sapient s financial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the acquisition of exor  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in connection with the acquisition of studio archetype  in the third quarter of sapient allocated million to in process technology and recorded a corresponding income tax benefit of million 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value of such technology based on risk adjusted cash flows related to development of projects that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition and with respect to which the in process research and development had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
sapient allocated values to the in process research and development projects by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of studio archetype next generation enterprise wide suite of development  scheduling  bug tracking and content management applications 
the integrated solution will be a comprehensive enterprise scale system  allowing developers and clients to access prototypes and trial deliverables 
it will fully integrate user interface tools with client server  advanced database and legacy systems 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development is based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by studio archetype and its competitors 
the estimated revenues for the projects are expected to be realized over a six year period through when other new products are expected to enter the market 
studio archetype projected revenues are dependent upon successful introduction of the in process projects 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products and services principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the efforts to develop the purchased in process technology also include testing of the technology for compatibility and interoperability with other applications 
expenditures on these projects to date have been approximately million  and estimated costs to complete these projects are expected to total approximately  through these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
several milestones have been or are near completion including a comprehensive needs analysis mapping data  technical and information architectures and building an integrated prototype 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were utilized for the business enterprise and for the in process r d 
sapient believes that these discount rates are commensurate with studio archetype stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advance that are unknown at this time 
the forecasts used by sapient in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
sapient s assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary materially from the assumed results and could have a material adverse effect on sapient s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sapient believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the assumed results and could have a material adverse effect on sapient s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sapient expects to continue its support of these efforts and believes studio has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and there is no assurance that any of the projects will meet with either technological or commercial success 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of studio may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may become impaired

sapient believes that the cash provided from operations  borrowings available under its revolving line of credit and the company s existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
year readiness the following disclosure shall be considered year readiness disclosure to the maximum extent allowed under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
sapient has developed a phased year readiness plan to help it identify and resolve year issues associated with sapient s internal systems and the services provided by sapient 
the plan includes development of corporate awareness  assessment  implementation including remediation and upgrading of certain product versions  validation testing and contingency planning 
since sapient has installed nearly all of its internal hardware and software systems since january  the company is not confronted with the task of having to replace obsolete or legacy systems 
primarily  sapient s task is to install upgrades and patches to its internally used software and hardware to make such systems and equipment year compliant 
sapient created a company wide year team to oversee its year program 
sapient has completed its assessment of its internal and third party computer systems and its internal non it systems such as building security  voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors 
sapient s material internal it systems consist principally of financial  accounting and human resources application software created by third parties  and internally developed sales forecasting and project management software applications 
all of sapient s internally developed applications are year compliant 
with respect to the third party software applications  sapient believes that  based on oral statements made by manufacturers and or statements published on manufacturers web sites  that such products will be year compliant 
at the manufacturer s recommendation  sapient recently installed patches in its versions of the windows and windows nt operating systems in order for those operating systems to become year compliant 
the manufacturers of sapient s computer hardware platforms  principally servers  have indicated that the versions currently used by the company are year compliant 
sapient is in the process of obtaining written assurances from each of the third party vendors that their systems both it and non it are year compliant 
sapient believes that it is complete in installing patches and upgrades to its third party software and hardware and expects to be completed with the implementation stage of its year program by the end of the second quarter of sapient also expects to have completed testing of all internally used software and hardware by the second quarter of based on currently available information  sapient believes the expense associated with these efforts will be approximately  however  if compliance efforts are not completed on time  or additional compliance efforts are required of which sapient is not currently aware  or the cost of any required updating or modification of our it systems exceeds our estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on sapient s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sapient has not yet developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address the situations that may result if it is unable to achieve year readiness of the company s major it and non it systems 
sapient intends to devise contingency plans by the end of the second quarter of to mitigate the effects on the conduct of the company s business in the event the year issue results in the unavailability of any material it or non it systems 
there can be no assurance that any contingency plans developed by sapient will prevent any such service interruption 
in addition to sapient s internal systems  the company relies on third party relationships in the conduct of its business 
for example  sapient relies on the services of the landlords of its facilities  telecommunication companies  banks  utilities  and commercial airlines 
sapient is currently seeking assurances from its landlords and material vendors regarding their year readiness  and to the extent such assurances are not given  the company intends to devise contingency plans to ameliorate the negative effects on sapient in the event the year issue results in the unavailability of services 
there can be no assurance that any contingency plans developed by sapient will prevent any such service interruption on the part of one or more of the company s third party vendors or suppliers from having a material adverse effect on sapient s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the failure on the part of the accounting systems of sapient s clients due to the year issue could result in a delay in the payment of invoices issued by sapient for services and expenses 
a failure of the accounting systems of a significant number of sapient s clients would have a material adverse effect on sapient s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sapient s business involves designing  developing and implementing mission critical software applications for its clients 
in addition  sapient has recommended  implemented and customized various third party software packages for its clients  certain of which may not be year compliant 
former  present and future clients may assert that certain services performed by sapient involved or are affected by the year issue 
because sapient has designed  developed and implemented software and systems for a large number of clients since  there can be no way of assuring that all such software programs and systems will be year compliant 
this uncertainty is magnified by the fact that in many cases sapient s clients retain the right to maintain  alter and modify the systems developed and implemented by sapient after the completion of an engagement 
due to the potential significance of the year issue upon client operations  upon any failure of critical client systems or processes that may be directly or indirectly connected or related to systems or software analyzed  designed  developed  or implemented by sapient  sapient may be subjected to claims regardless of whether the failure is related to the services provided by sapient 
if asserted  such claims and the associated defense costs could have a material adverse effect on the sapient s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sapient s policy has been to attempt to include provisions in its client contracts that  among other things  disclaim implied warranties  limit the duration of express warranties  limit sapient s liability to the amount of fees paid by the client to sapient in connection with the project  and disclaim any liability arising from third party software that is implemented  customized or installed by sapient 
there can be no assurance that sapient will be able to obtain these contractual protections in agreements concerning future projects  or that any contractual provisions governing current and completed projects  will prevent clients from asserting claims against sapient with respect to the year issue 
there also can be no assurance that the contractual protections  if any  obtained by sapient will effectively operate to protect the company from  or limit the amount of  any liability arising from claims asserted against sapient 
the foregoing discussion of sapient s year readiness contains forward looking statements including estimates of the timeframes and costs for addressing the known year issues confronting sapient and is based on management s current estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual events and results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability of sapient to identify and correct all year problems and the success of third parties with whom sapient does business in addressing their year issues
