overview we design  develop  manufacture and market proprietary  high voltage  analog ics for use in ac to dc power conversion primarily for the cellular telephone  personal computer  cable and direct broadcast satellite and various consumer electronics markets 
from our inception in march through  we developed numerous standard and custom products incorporating high levels of features and functionality  each intended to address the needs of various markets 
although we succeeded in developing the core of our patented technology during this period  market penetration of our products was low because these products were not as cost effective as alternative products 
limited product revenue and the high costs associated with developing and marketing numerous solutions to numerous target markets resulted in our being unprofitable 
in  we changed our strategy to focus on bringing cost effective  integrated products to the high voltage ac to dc power supply markets 
as a result  in  we completed development of topswitch  the first in our family of cost effective  high voltage  power conversion ics 
the topswitch family of products  with its proprietary integrated architecture  is designed to address with relatively few products broad applications in a number of high volume  high voltage ac to dc power supply markets 
the initial target markets served by topswitch are particularly sensitive to size  portability  energy efficiency and time to market 
the topswitch products and the solutions enabled by them are significantly lower in cost than our previous products and the solutions enabled by those products 
commercial shipments of topswitch began in may primarily as a result of the increasing sales of topswitch products  our net revenues from product sales more than tripled between and  increasing from million to million 
net revenues from product sales increased sequentially by in  in and in by focusing on the topswitch family of products  we were able to more effectively utilize our resources and limit the growth of operating expenses in and because of this and the growth in net revenues  operating expenses were reduced from of net revenues in to of net revenues in in response to increasing market acceptance of our topswitch products and faster revenue growth in  we accelerated our investment in research and development and sales and marketing  including technical customer support 
as a result  operating expenses were million in  million in and million in we expect that operating expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but will fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues  as we continue to add resources to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative activities 
we have experienced increased net revenues in each of the last eight quarters when compared to the same quarters of the prior year  achieved a positive income from operations in each of those quarters  and achieved positive net income in each of the quarters since june  however  the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including 
the volume and timing of orders received from customers  
competitive pressures on selling prices  
the volume and timing of orders placed by us with our foundries  
the availability of raw materials  
fluctuations in manufacturing yields  whether resulting from the transition to new foundries or from other factors  
changes in product mix including the impact of new product introduction on existing products  
our ability to develop and bring to market new products and technologies on a timely basis  
the introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  
market acceptance of ours and our customers products  
the timing of investments in research and development and sales and marketing  
cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen  
changes in the international business climate  and 
economic conditions generally 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we license certain technologies and grant limited product manufacturing and marketing rights to strategic partners in return for foundry relationships  license fees and product royalty arrangements 
prior to the introduction of topswitch in  our analog ics generated limited product sales while license fees and prepaid royalties accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenues 
in future periods  we expect license fees and royalties to consist primarily of royalties on products shipped by licensees incorporating licensed technology  and anticipate that license fees and royalties will account for a small percentage of net revenues 
we do not expect significant prepaid license fees from future license agreements 
a portion of our cost of revenues consists of the cost of wafers 
the contract prices to purchase wafers from matsushita and oki are denominated in japanese yen 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen subject our gross profit and operating results to the potential for material fluctuations 
from time to time  as our strategic partners close old production lines and move to new fabrication facilities  we must absorb a portion of the costs of physically moving the manufacturing of our products to new production lines  including the costs of installation of new process technologies 
product revenues consist of sales to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers and to distributors 
revenues from product sales to oems and merchant power supply manufacturers are recognized upon shipment 
at that time  we provide for estimated sales returns and other allowances related to those sales 
approximately half of our sales are made to distributors under terms allowing certain rights of return and price protection for our products held in the distributors inventories 
therefore  we defer recognition of revenue and the proportionate cost of revenues derived from sales to distributors until such distributors resell our products to their customers 
the gross profit deferred as a result of this policy is reflected as deferred income on sales to distributors on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
percentage of total net revenues year ended december  net revenues product sales license fees and royalties total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes 
net income loss comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues consist of revenues from product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  plus license fees and royalties paid by licensees of our technology 
net revenues increased from million in to million in net revenues from product sales represented million and million of net revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in net revenues from product sales was due primarily to increased sales of our topswitch family of products  which represented of product sales in the migration from topswitch to topswitch ii continued with topswitch ii accounting for of product revenue in compared to for we began commercial shipment of topswitch ii in april net revenues also grew because of an increase in royalty revenues  from million to million in the two periods  respectively 
international sales increased by million in compared to  growing from approximately of net revenues in to approximately of net revenues in although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of such power supplies are manufactured in asia 
as a result  the largest portion of our net revenues is derived from sales to this region 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a large portion of our net revenues 
in  two separate customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues 
in  one of the same customers and one different customer accounted for approximately and of net revenues  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross profit 
gross profit is equal to net revenues less cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the purchase of wafers from matsushita and oki  the assembly and packaging of our products  and internal labor and overhead associated with the testing of both wafers and packaged components 
these costs include expenses incurred in connection with the physical move of the manufacturing of our products between wafer production lines at both of our foundry suppliers and with the installation of new process technologies at these foundries 
this may recur from time to time and adversely affect our cost of revenues 
gross profit increased from million  or of net revenues  to million  or of net revenues  in and  respectively 
efficiencies realized from higher volumes  reductions in both wafers and packaging costs  improved test yields  and a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen through most of the year contributed to the improvement in gross profit 
gross profit in future periods may be influenced by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  and expensed material and facility costs associated with the development of new processes and new products 
we also expense prototype wafers and mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until new products are released to production 
research and development expenses increased by approximately  from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased salaries and other costs related to the hiring of additional engineering personnel  outside consulting fees and expensed prototype materials resulting from the transition of foundry manufacturing processes with matsushita and oki 
these expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in due to increased sales 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but will fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives and facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
sales and marketing expenses increased approximately  from million in to million in  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
this increase represents the addition of personnel to support international sales and field application engineers 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but will fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  and legal and auditing expenses 
in and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
this increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to increased professional and legal expenses related to our patent infringement lawsuit filed against motorola 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars  and may increase as a percentage of net revenues while our patent infringement lawsuit against motorola continues 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  was  net expense in and million net income in the net expense in reflects interest incurred on capital equipment lease obligations and on million of subordinated debt  which originated in the second quarter of  partially offset by interest income earned on cash and short term investments 
the net income in reflects an increase in interest income due to the increase in cash and short term investments from to  and the reduction in interest expense due to the repayment of the subordinated debt in provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for and represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate was for and for reflecting the profitable results for both years 
the difference between the statutory rate and our effective tax rate for and is due to the impact of benefiting net operating loss carryforwards  offset by a change in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues increased from million in to million in net revenues from product sales represented million and million of net revenues in and  respectively 
the increase in net revenues from product sales was due primarily to increased sales of our topswitch family of products and  to a lesser extent  initial sales of the topswitch ii family of products  which began commercial shipment in april net revenues also grew because of an increase in royalty revenues  from  to million in the two periods  respectively 
international sales increased by million in compared to  growing from approximately of net revenues in to approximately of net revenues in although the power supplies using our products are designed and distributed worldwide  most of such power supplies are manufactured in asia 
as a result  the largest portion of our revenues is derived from sales to this region 
in  net revenues from two different customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues 
for the year ended december   no individual customers accounted for more than of net revenues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross profit 
gross profit increased from million  or of net revenues  to million  or of net revenues  in and  respectively  due to the combined effects of the absorption of certain fixed costs over the increased sales volume  lower prices for wafers  partially as a result of favorable foreign exchange rates  and improved packaging costs 
during this period we experienced an improved foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen  contributing approximately  or approximately percentage points  of the gross profit 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of increased salaries and other costs related to the hiring of additional engineering personnel  outside consulting fees and expensed prototype materials resulting from the transition of foundry manufacturing processes with matsushita and oki 
these expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in due to increased sales 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  from million in to million in  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
this increase represents the addition of personnel to support international sales and field application engineers 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars but will fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
in and  general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively  which represented and of net revenues  respectively 
this increase in absolute dollars is attributable to additional headcount to support the growth in the volume of sales 
interest and other expense  net 
interest and other expense  net  of  and  in and  respectively  reflects interest incurred on capital equipment lease obligations and on the million of subordinated debt originated in the second quarter of  partially offset by interest income earned on cash and short term investments 
we repaid the subordinated debt with proceeds from our initial public offering and expect to continue to utilize term debt to finance capital equipment needs 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for and represents federal  state and foreign taxes 
the increase in the effective rate from for to for reflects the profitable results for the period 
the difference between the statutory rate and our effective tax rate for is due to the impact of benefiting net operating loss carryforwards  offset by a change in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

 net revenues product sales license fees and royalties total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues increased in each of the four consecutive quarters through the quarter ended december  and were up sequentially in the second and third quarters of  primarily due to increased shipments of our topswitch family of products 
sequential net revenues were down in the first and fourth quarters of due  we believe  to the seasonal nature of some of our markets 
increased shipments were due to growth in the volume of sales from existing customers  the addition of new customers and  in the second quarter of  the introduction of the topswitch ii product family 
our gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues during each of the eight quarters ended december  the gross profit improvements generally were due to efficiencies realized from higher volumes  reductions in material costs  improved test yields and a favorable yen exchange rate 
research and development expenses increased in absolute terms during the eight quarters presented  primarily due to increased staffing in the areas of new product design and technology development 
research and development expenses fluctuated as a percentage of net revenues  but primarily trended downward due to increases in net revenues 
sales and marketing expenses generally increased in absolute dollars over the eight quarters presented  primarily due to the additional staffing in sales and application engineering and increased sales commissions due to the increased revenues from product sales 
sales expenses were down in the first and second quarters of due to reduced commissions because of lower seasonal net revenues 
general and administrative expenses increased only slightly during the first six quarters presented and increased more in the third and fourth quarters of primarily due to increased legal expense related to our patent infringement lawsuit filed against motorola 
interest and other income expense  net  was a net expense in the four quarters of primarily due to interest expense resulting from increased borrowings under our capital lease lines  and from the million subordinated debt incurred in may in the four quarters of  interest and other income expense  net  was a net income primarily from increased interest income from higher cash balances created by a net positive cash flow as well as cash proceeds from our initial public offering in december in addition  the repayment of the subordinated debt in december reduced interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources in december  we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares of common stock raising approximately million in gross proceeds 
prior to this public offering  we financed our operations from revenues from product sales and proceeds from the private sales of preferred and common stock 
we have also funded operations through the sales of technology licenses and engineering design services  and various capital equipment lease lines with terms extending from thirty six to forty eight months  and an million revolving line of credit with imperial bank 
the line of credit with imperial bank has since expired 
in october  we established a new revolving line of credit with union bank of california in the amount of million 
a portion of the credit line is used to cover advances for commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit  which we provide to matsushita and oki prior to the shipment of wafers by the foundries to us 
the balance of this credit line is unused and available 
the line of credit agreement contains financial covenants and requires that we maintain profitability on a quarterly basis and not pay or declare dividends without the bank s prior consent 
we have financed a significant portion of our machinery and equipment through capital equipment leases 
in  we entered into a new capital equipment lease line of credit with ge capital corporation which allows for combined borrowings of up to million to finance the acquisition of property and equipment 
approximately million was available at december  under this line of credit 
at december   we owed approximately million on our various capital equipment leases 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of million  which was an increase of approximately million over december  the increase was primarily due to net income of million in at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and no borrowings outstanding on our bank line of credit 
our operating activities generated cash of million and million in and  respectively 
cash generated in was principally the result of net income  depreciation and amortization  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
cash generated in was principally the result of net income  depreciation and amortization  increases in deferred income and accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in inventories 
our investing activities were a net transfer from cash to short term investments of  and million in and  respectively 
financing activities provided million of net cash during and used million in the cash provided from financing activities in was primarily due to the issuance of common stock and the cash used in was primarily for payments on capital lease obligations 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with existing sources of liquidity  will satisfy our projected working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
year issues some computers  software  and other equipment include computer code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches  and are commonly referred to as the year problem 
assessment 
the year problem affects the computers  software and other equipment that we use  operate or maintain for our operations 
accordingly  we have organized a program team responsible for monitoring the assessment and remediation status of our year projects and reporting such status to our board of directors 
this project team is currently assessing the potential effect and costs of remediating the year problem for our internal systems 
to date  we have not obtained verification or validation from any independent third parties of our processes to assess and correct any of our year problems or the costs associated with these activities 
internal infrastructure 
we believe that we have identified most of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with our internal operations that will need to be evaluated to determine if they must be modified  upgraded or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to our business 
upon completion of this evaluation  which we expect to occur by the end of march  we will complete the process of modifying  upgrading  and replacing major systems that have been assessed as adversely affected 
we expect to complete this process  which began in  before the occurrence of any material disruption of our business 
systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  telephone switches  security systems  and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
we are currently assessing the potential effect and costs of remediating the year problem on our office  equipment and our facilities in sunnyvale  california 
we estimate the total cost to us of completing any required modifications  upgrades or replacements of our internal systems  beyond expenditures planned to meet the needs for managing our growth  to be approximately  almost all of which we believe will be incurred during this estimate is being monitored and we will revise it  as additional information becomes available 
based on the activities described above  we do not believe that the year problem will have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
in addition  we have not deferred any material information technology projects as a result of our year problem activities 
suppliers 
we are in the process of contacting third party suppliers of components used in the manufacture of our products to identify and  to the extent possible  resolve issues involving the year problem 
however  we have limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while we expect that we will be able to resolve any significant year problems with these third parties  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve any or all year problems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the operation of our business 
any failure of these third parties to resolve year problems with their systems  on a timely basis  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
customers 
we are in the process of contacting our customers and  to the extent possible  determining their year readiness and to ensure that our revenue flow will not be substantially impacted by their inability to take delivery of planned product shipments 
however  we have limited or no control over the actions of these customers 
thus  while we expect that we will be able to resolve any significant year problems with them  there can be no assurance that these customers will resolve any or all year problems before the occurrence of a material reduction in the sale of our products 
any failure of these customers to resolve year problems with their systems  on a timely basis  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
most likely consequences of year problems 
we expect to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect our business operations 
however  we believe that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting us have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  no one can accurately predict how many year problem related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
as a result  we believe that the following consequences are possible 
a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for us  our contract manufacturers and our customers that will divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from ordinary business activities  
several business disputes and claims for pricing adjustments or penalties due to year problems by our customers  which we believe will be resolved in the ordinary course of business  and 
a few serious business disputes alleging that we failed to comply with the terms of contracts or industry standards of performance  some of which could result in litigation or contract termination 
contingency plans 
we are currently developing contingency plans to be implemented if our efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting our internal systems are not effective 
we expect to complete our contingency plans by the end of june depending on the systems affected  these plans could include 
accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  
short to medium term use of backup equipment and software  
increased work hours for our personnel  and 
use of contract personnel on an accelerated schedule to correct any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems 
our implementation of any of these contingency plans could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
disclaimer 
the discussion of our efforts and expectations relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
our ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely affected by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  third party suppliers ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  which establishes standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income 
we adopted sfas no 
 which requires companies to report a new measure of income  in the first quarter of comprehensive income is to include foreign currency translation gains and losses and other unrealized gains and losses that have historically been excluded from net income and reflected instead in equity 
sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
during  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires a new basis of determining reportable business segments  ie  the management approach 
this approach requires that business segment information used by management to assess performance and manage company resources be the source for information disclosure 
on this basis  we are organized and operate as one business segment  the design  development  manufacture and marketing of proprietary  high voltage  analog circuits used for the ac to dc power conversion market 
as a result  the adoption of sfas had no impact on our disclosures or financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business before purchasing shares of our stock 
our operating results fluctuate and are unpredictable 
our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past  are difficult to forecast  are subject to numerous factors both within and outside of our control  and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
although we were profitable in each of the last eight quarters  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in future periods 
we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future operating results 
we believe that the growth in revenues and operating income in compared to resulted in large part from a combination of factors  including increased market acceptance of our topswitch product and customer ordering patterns 
we cannot assure you of similar growth rates in future periods 

our operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders received 
our revenues and operating results are substantially dependent upon the volume and timing of orders received from our customers 
we have historically experienced lengthy sales cycles which limit our visibility regarding future financial performance 
we are also subject to the risks to which the markets for our customers or end users products are subject  and to technological or other changes in those markets which may affect customer buying patterns 
in addition  the ordering patterns of some of our existing large customers have been unpredictable in the past  and we expect that customer ordering patterns will continue to be unpredictable in the future 
not only does the volume of units ordered by particular customers vary substantially from period to period  but also purchase orders received from particular customers often vary substantially from early oral estimates provided by those customers for planning purposes 
our business is characterized by short term customer orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
we have in the past experienced customer cancellations of substantial orders for reasons beyond our control  and significant cancellations could occur again at any time in the future 

our operating results are subject to competitive pressures on selling prices 
our revenues and operating results are also subject to competitive pressures on selling prices 
historically  average selling prices of products in the semiconductor and the high voltage ac to dc power supply industries have decreased over the lives of the products 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products with higher average selling prices or are unable to reduce manufacturing costs to offset expected decreases in the prices of our existing products  our operating margins will be adversely affected 

our operating results are dependent upon the volume and timing of our orders with our foundries 
our operating results are also substantially dependent upon the volume and timing of orders that we place with our foundries 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  we must plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is unpredictable and may fluctuate substantially 
if we underestimate the number of units required to meet customer demand and fail to maintain adequate inventory levels  we may lose significant revenue opportunities and market share to competitors 
on the other hand  if we overestimate the number of units required to meet customer demand  our operating results may be materially adversely affected as a result of costs associated with carrying excess inventory and with obsolescence 
excess inventory and obsolescence costs could be further increased by any unestimated returns from our distributors or customers 

other factors which may affect our operating results 
other factors which may affect our revenues and operating results include the following 
availability of raw materials  
fluctuations in manufacturing yields  whether resulting from the transition to new foundries or from other factors  
changes in product mix  including the impact of new product introduction on existing products  
our ability to develop and bring to market new products and technologies on a timely basis  
the introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  
market acceptance of our and our customers products  
the timing of investments in research and development and sales and marketing  
cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  
fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen  
changes in the international business climate  and 
economic conditions generally 
our operating results in a future quarter or quarters are likely to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such an event  the price of our common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results 
we have a limited history of profitability and an accumulated deficit 
since our inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flow 
at december   we had cumulative net losses of million  with a net loss of million for and net profits of million and million for and  respectively 
although we achieved positive net incomes for and  we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in any future quarterly or annual periods  and recent operating results should not be considered indicative of future financial performance 
we depend on the cellular phone battery charger and desktop pc stand by markets for a majority of our revenues 
a limited number of applications of our products  primarily in the cellular phone battery chargers and desktop pc stand by markets  currently account for the majority of our revenues 
the exact dollar amounts and percentages of sales for use in particular markets are difficult to ascertain because such sales occur through distributors or indirectly through sales to power supply manufacturers 
during we estimate that approximately of our revenues were attributable to use of our products in power supplies for cellular phone battery chargers and approximately of our revenues were attributable to the use of our products in desktop pc stand by power supplies 
we expect that our revenues and operating results will continue to be substantially dependent upon these markets for the foreseeable future 
the cellular phone and desktop pc markets can be highly cyclical and have been subject to significant economic downturns at various times 
we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general conditions of these markets 
our revenues and operating results are subject to many of the risks to which the markets for these applications are subject  and may also be impacted by technological or other developments in these markets 
in particular  recent advances in battery technology which offer competitive advantages to the oems of cellular telephones permit such oems  including our largest end user  motorola  to lower  or consider lowering  the wattage level of the power supplies used to recharge batteries 
as the output power has dropped below watts for some slow or trickle chargers  older alternative technologies have been substituted for switchers by some oems 
although this has not had any significant impact on our business to date  it could in the future if these older technological alternatives are more cost effective than our current and future product offerings 
while we continue our efforts to enhance the cost effectiveness of integrated switchers based on our high voltage ics  we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our efforts  and  in the absence of a successful competitive response  demand for our products would be materially adversely affected 
similarly  if a competitor successfully and cost effectively combines desktop pc stand by power supplies with the main pc desktop power supplies before we do  demand for our products could be materially adversely affected 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to penetrate additional markets for our products  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to overcome the marketing or technological challenges necessary to do so 
to the extent that a competitor penetrates additional markets before we do  or takes market share from us in our existing markets  our revenues  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we are highly dependent on a limited number of customers 
our end user base is highly concentrated  and a relatively small number of oems  directly or indirectly through merchant power supply manufacturers  accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in  and motorola is presently our largest end user 
the exact dollar amounts and percentages of sales to motorola are difficult to ascertain because most of such sales occur through distributors or indirectly through sales to merchant power supply manufacturers which  in turn  sell power supplies to motorola 
we estimate that direct and indirect sales to motorola accounted for approximately of our net revenues for we estimate that our top customers  including distributors which resell to motorola and other large oems and merchant power supply manufacturers  accounted for  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to be dependent upon a relatively limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues in future periods 
also  no customer is presently obligated either to purchase a specified amount of products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any period 
our products are typically one of many components used in a larger product produced by our customers 
demand for our products is therefore subject to many risks beyond our control  including  among others 
competition faced by our customers in their particular end markets  
market acceptance of the products of our customers  
technical challenges which may or may not be related to the components supplied by us  and 
the technical  sales and marketing and management capabilities of our customers and the financial and other resources of our customers 
certain divisions within motorola have developed products intended to compete with us  as has samsung  another customer of our products 
we believe that we have been successful in competing against such internally developed products to date  but in the future we may lose sales as a result of such competing products 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from motorola or one of our other significant customers  or the discontinuance of our products by our end users  could materially adversely affect our business  financial conditions and operating results 
we have experienced such effects in the past and we cannot assure you that any of our customers will not reduce  cancel or delay orders in the future 
we are dependent on our wafer suppliers 
we outsource all of our semiconductor manufacturing and product assembly  except for testing and finishing 
we have supply arrangements for the production of wafers with matsushita and oki 
although certain aspects of our relationships with matsushita and oki are contractual  many important aspects of these relationships depend on the continued cooperation of these strategic partners and  in many instances  the parties course of conduct deviates from the literal provisions of the contracts 
we cannot assure you that our strategic partners and we will continue to work together successfully in the future or that either matsushita or oki will not seek an early termination of its wafer supply agreement with us 
our wafer supply contracts with matsushita and oki terminate in june and september  respectively 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to reach an agreement with matsushita to extend the term of its wafer supply agreement 
failure to reach  in a timely fashion  an extension of our agreement with matsushita or to enter into an arrangement with another manufacturer could result in material disruptions in supply 
certain contractual provisions limit the conditions under which we can enter into such arrangements with other japanese manufacturers or their subsidiaries during the term of our agreement with matsushita 
in addition  our products do not require leading edge device process geometries 
as device process geometries become increasingly smaller and as demand for such smaller geometries increases  matsushita and oki may decide at some point to convert all of their manufacturing processes to smaller geometries in response to these industry trends 
in the event of a supply disruption with oki or matsushita  if we were unable to quickly qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products or if such sources were unable to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields  our business  financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we estimate that it would take between to months from the time an alternate manufacturing source is identified for that source to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields in sufficient quantities to meet our needs 
we typically receive shipments from matsushita or oki in approximately to weeks after placing orders  and lead times for new products can be substantially longer 
to provide sufficient time for assembly  testing and finishing  we typically need to receive wafers from matsushita or oki to weeks before the desired ship date to our customers 
as a result of these factors and the fact that customers orders can be made with little advance notice  we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
this could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
from time to time in the past we have been unable to fully satisfy customer requests as a result of these factors 
any significant disruptions in deliveries would materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
although we provide oki and matsushita with rolling forecasts of our production requirements  the ability of matsushita or oki to provide wafers to us is limited by the available capacity of the foundry in which it manufactures wafers for us 
an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of other customers could cause matsushita and oki to reduce capacity available to us 
matsushita and oki may also require us to pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other concessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customers requirements 
any of these concessions could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
we carry a substantial amount of inventory of tested wafers to help offset these factors to better serve our markets and meet customer demand 
we rely on our contracted foundries and independent subcontractors to produce wafers and assemble finished products at acceptable yields 
we depend on matsushita and oki to produce wafers  and independent subcontractors to assemble finished products  at acceptable yields and to deliver them to us in a timely manner 
the manufacture of our topswitch products utilizes a cmos process with a proprietary  highly sensitive implant process step 
to the extent the wafer foundries do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or they experience product shipment delays  our financial condition or operating results would be materially adversely affected 
our ic assembly process also requires our manufacturers to use a high voltage molding compound available from only one vendor  which is difficult to process 
this compound and its required processes  together with the other non standard materials and processes needed to assemble our products  require a more exacting level of process control than normally required for standard packages 
unavailability of the sole source compound or problems with the assembly process can materially adversely affect yields and cost to manufacture 
good production yields are particularly important to our business and financial results  including our ability to meet customers demand for products and to maintain profitability 
as we continue to increase our product output  our foundries and assemblers may experience a decrease in yields 
we cannot assure you that acceptable yields will be maintainable in the future 
matsushita and oki have certain licenses to our technology which they may use to our detriment 
matsushita currently manufactures and sells its versions of our topswitch families of products under the right  exclusive during the term of the contract as to other japanese companies  except oki and their subsidiaries  granted by us to manufacture and sell products using our technology to japanese companies worldwide and to subsidiaries of japanese companies located in asia 
in certain circumstances  these products are redistributed by the japanese customers to their manufacturing operations in other regions 
beginning in april  we agreed not to sell our products in japan to new customers 
we receive royalties on sales by matsushita  although such royalties are substantially lower than the gross profit we would receive on direct sales 
in addition  the royalties paid by matsushita are denominated in japanese yen and are subject to risks inherent in exchange rate fluctuations 
although we engage in sales  marketing and support activities to encourage sales by matsushita  should matsushita fail to adequately promote and deliver our products  our ability to take advantage of the potentially large japanese market for our products could be severely limited 
should we fail to negotiate acceptable royalty bearing extensions to our contract with matsushita  we would need to expend substantial effort and expense to establish ourselves in this market directly or through a different partner 
there can be no assurance that we would not lose customers for matsushita s products during such a transition 
in addition  the licenses to matsushita and oki for many important aspects of our technology are perpetual 
we cannot assure you that matsushita or oki will not use these technology rights to develop or market competing products following any termination of their relationships with us or after termination of matsushita s royalty obligation to us 
our international sales subject us to substantial risks 
sales to customers outside of the united states were million  million and million in  and  respectively  which represented  and of our net revenues for such periods 
these sales involve a number of inherent risks  including 
imposition of government controls  
currency exchange fluctuations  
potential insolvency of international distributors and representatives  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
the impact of recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  
political instability  
generally longer receivables collection periods  
tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  and 
the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
furthermore  because substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars  increase in the value of the dollar would increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive and less price competitive than competitors products that are priced in local currencies 
we are exposed to additional risks to the extent that the products of our customers are subject to foreign currency or other international risks 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we are dependent on foreign manufacturers and assemblers for the manufacture of our wafers 
because we depend on matsushita and oki  both located in japan  for the manufacture of all of our finished silicon wafers and on foreign assembly subcontractors of our products  we are directly affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which our wafers are or are expected to be manufactured 
to the extent that these conditions result in any prolonged work stoppages or other inability to manufacture and assemble our products  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our contracts with matsushita and oki are denominated in japanese yen  exposing us to the risk of increased costs for finished wafers  which increase we could not readily pass through to our customers 
new products and technological change may render our and our customers products out of date 
our future success depends in significant part upon our ability to develop new ics for high voltage power conversion for existing and new markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into products of leading manufacturers 
the development of these new devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including 
accurate new product definition  
timely completion and introduction of new product designs  
availability of foundry capacity  
achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and 
market acceptance of our and our customers products 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to adjust to changing market demands as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that such products will achieve market acceptance 
our or our customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
certain customers may defer or return orders for existing products in response to the introduction of new products 
although we maintain reserves against any such returns  there can be no assurance that these reserves will be adequate 
we have historically experienced a lengthy sales cycle 
our products are generally incorporated into a customer s products at the design stage 
however  customer decisions to use our products  commonly referred to as design wins  which can often require us to expend significant resources without any assurance of success  often precede volume sales  if any  by a year or more 
if a customer decides at the design stage not to incorporate our products into its product  we may not have another opportunity for a design win with respect to that product for many months or years 
because of such a lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and our sales and marketing efforts and the generation of volume production revenues  if any  from such expenditures 
moreover  the value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer s product 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to achieve design wins or that any design win will result in future revenues 
our failure to timely develop and introduce products that are incorporated into our customers products could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our products must meet exacting specifications  and undetected defects and failures may occur 
the fabrication and assembly of ics is a highly complex and precise process 
we expect that our customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that our products must meet 
ics as complex as those we sell often encounter development delays and may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments 
we have from time to time in the past experienced product quality  performance or reliability problems 
we cannot guarantee that defects or failures will not occur in the future relating to our product quality  performance and reliability that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if such defects and failures occur  we could experience lost revenue  increased costs  including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or reschedulings of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts  any of which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the high voltage power supply industry is extremely competitive and highly price sensitive 
the high voltage power supply industry is intensely competitive and characterized by extreme price sensitivity 
accordingly  the most significant competitive factor in the target markets for our products is cost effectiveness 
our products face competition from alternative technologies  including traditional linear transformers and discrete switcher power supplies 
we believe that at current pricing  our high voltage power conversion ic families of products offer favorable cost performance benefits compared to the competition 
however  there has been sizeable over capacity of discrete components  which resulted in significant price erosion for these products during continued significant erosion in the price of competing products  such as high voltage bipolar and mosfet transistors and pwm controller ics  could adversely affect the cost effectiveness of our products 
also  older alternative technologies to switchers are more cost effective than discrete switchers and integrated switchers that use our products in certain power ranges for certain applications 
if power requirements for certain applications in which our products are currently utilized  such as battery chargers for cellular telephones  drop below certain power levels  these older alternative technologies can be used more cost effectively than topswitch based switchers 
we are continuing our efforts to enhance the cost effectiveness of integrated switchers in the lower power ranges but we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in these efforts 
recently  our topswitch product families have begun to meet additional competition from hybrid and single high voltage ics similar to topswitch 
these competing products are being developed or have been developed and are being produced by companies such as motorola  stmicroelectronics  samsung and sanken 
we expect competition to increase as companies like these see the success we have had in converting older technologies to the integrated solutions used in our product offerings 
to the extent these competitors products are more cost effective than our products  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
many of our emerging competitors  including motorola  stmicroelectronics  samsung and sanken  have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
in the context of a market where a high voltage ic is designed into a customer s product and the provider of such ics is therefore the sole source of the ic for that product  greater manufacturing resources may be a significant factor in the customer s choice of the ic because of the customer s perception of greater certainty in its source of supply 
our ability to compete in our target markets also depends on such factors as 
timing and success of new product introductions by us and our competitors  
the pace at which our customers incorporate our products into their end user products  
availability of wafer fabrication and finished good manufacturing capability  
availability of adequate sources of raw materials  
protection of our products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws  and 
general economic conditions 
we cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering this market 
our failure to compete successfully in the high voltage power supply business would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we must protect our intellectual property and have sued  and have been sued  by our largest end user  motorola  regarding certain patents 
our future success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  and know how  and to continue our technological innovation 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
in july  we filed a complaint for patent infringement in the us district court  northern district of california  against our largest end user  motorola 
in august  we voluntarily dismissed the complaint  and filed a new complaint in the us district court  district of delaware  alleging that motorola has infringed and continues to infringe on two of our circuit patents 
we seek  among other things  an order enjoining motorola from infringing on our patents and an award for damages resulting from the alleged infringement 
in october  motorola asserted various counterclaims against us alleging that we are infringing on certain of motorola s patents 
we believe that motorola s counterclaims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
litigation may be necessary to resolve the claims we have asserted against motorola and to resolve the claims motorola has asserted against us 
there can be no assurance that we would prevail in any future litigation 
any litigation  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  would be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
adverse determinations in litigation could result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from licensing our technology  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our technology is or may in the future be licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of infringement of our intellectual property 
we depend on a few key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  such as experienced systems applications engineers 
the competition for these employees is intense  particularly in silicon valley 
the loss of the services of one or more of our engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
we do not have long term employment contracts with  and we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on  any of our employees 
our future success depends on our successful management of growth 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
to accommodate this growth  we will be required to implement a variety of new and upgraded operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our internal management systems  which may require substantial management efforts 
such efforts may not be accomplished successfully 
in addition  any future periods of rapid growth or expansion could be expected to place a significant strain on our limited managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
relationships with new customers generally require significant engineering support 
as a result  any increase in the number of customers using our technology will increase the strain on our resources  particularly our engineers 
any delays or difficulties in our research and development process caused by these factors or others could make it difficult for us to develop future generations of our products and to remain competitive 
in addition  the rapid rate of hiring new employees could be disruptive and adversely affect the efficiency of our research and development process 
any failure to improve our operational  financial and management systems  or to hire  train  motivate or manage our employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
arrival of the year may create unforeseen difficulties 
many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year  and therefore  computer hardware and software for virtually all businesses will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
we are concerned that many enterprises will be devoting a substantial portion of their information systems spending to resolving this upcoming year problem 
this expense may result in spending being diverted from ics for use in ac to dc power conversion in the near future 
we are still assessing the impact of the year issue on our internal information systems and have begun  and in many cases completed  corrective efforts in these areas 
we have evaluated the functionality of our current products with respect to any year problems and have determined that our current products have no year problems 
we do not anticipate that addressing the year problem for our internal information systems and future products will have a material impact on our operations or financial results 
however  we cannot assure you that these costs will not be greater than anticipated  or that we will complete the corrective actions we have undertaken before any year problems could occur 
the year issue could lower demand for our products while increasing our costs 
these combining factors  while not quantified  could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
we have certain relationships with key suppliers 
if these suppliers fail to adequately address the year issue for the products they provide to us  this could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 
we are still assessing the effect the year issue will have on our suppliers and at this time we cannot determine the impact it will have 
contingency plans will be developed if it appears we or our key suppliers will not be year compliant 
any such noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have adopted certain anti takeover measures which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
these provisions provide  among other things  that 
stockholders may not take action by written consent  
the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and to raise matters at stockholders meetings is restricted  and 
certain amendments of our certificate of incorporation  and all amendments of our bylaws  require the approval of holders of at least two thirds of the voting power of all outstanding shares 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock has been  and is likely to be  volatile 
factors such as future announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in our product pricing policies or those of our competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons which may be unrelated to operating results 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  market and political conditions such as recessions or military conflicts  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
moreover  the trading prices of many high technology stocks are at or near their historical highs and reflect price earning ratios substantially above historical norms 
we cannot assure you that the trading price of our common stock will remain at or near the price at which you may have purchased it
