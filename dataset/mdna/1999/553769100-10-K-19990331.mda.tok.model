item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in december  the company acquired mountaineer park with the intent of enhancing its facilities for promotion as a high quality gaming  racing and recreation resort 
shortly thereafter  the company determined to focus primarily on the gaming industry 
the company anticipates that mountaineer park  particularly video lottery operations  will continue to be the dominant factor in the company s financial condition for at least the next fiscal year 
ultimately  the profitability of the speedway and reno properties  which the company acquired in the second quarter of  will be directly related to whether and when the company obtains all necessary nevada gaming approvals 
the company has been advised that the licensing process may take approximately a year to complete  and that there can be no assurance that the company will obtain such licenses 
twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december total revenues increased by  from to  an increase of 
approximately million of the increase was produced by video lottery operations  while the parimutuel commissions and lodging  food  beverage and other operations at mountaineer park contributed approximately million of additional revenues 
management believes the increase resulted primarily from increased patronage resulting from the company s expanded advertising activities  the increase to  video slots in july as compared to from january through march  and  thereafter together with a change in law that permitted mountaineer park to change the ratio of video slots in the lodge as compared to the racetrack building  the introduction of a variety of video slots  the expansion of the speakeasy gaming saloon and other enhanced facilities 
the nevada properties contributed  in lodging  food and beverage revenues in the year ended december  since the may acquisition  the speedway property has generally been dark during renovation of hotel rooms and food and beverage facilities and construction of the  square foot casino building and parking lots 
there were no gaming operations at either property during video lottery operations revenues from video lottery operations increased from million in to million in an amendment of the lottery law that became effective in june of permitted mountaineer park to change the ratio of video slots located in the lodge versus the racetrack building from to terminals located in the lodge s speakeasy gaming saloon are more popular than those at the racetrack and account for significantly more revenue 
to capitalize on the change in law  the company constructed a  square foot addition to the lodge s speakeasy gaming saloon  obtained regulatory approval to increase the total number of video slots from  to  by leasing new nickel machines  and placed video slots in the lodge and in the racetrack building as of july  
with the expansion of the speakeasy  mountaineer park also doubled the size of big al s deli and added additional bar and entertainment facilities 
these changes  together with the company s advertising campaign  are primarily responsible for the dramatic increase in revenue 
management also believes that the introduction of variety in mountaineer park s video slots in terms of both manufacturers and types of games nickel based as well as quarter based contributed to the increased patronage 
previously  only one manufacturer had been authorized to provide video slots in west virginia 
in december  mountaineer park leased more video slots in the speakeasy and in the racetrack building from a third manufacturer in anticipation of initiating four progressive video slot banks 
these machines were placed in service on december  and therefore did not have a material impact on operations for the year ended december  for the twelve months ended december   average daily net win on the vlts placed at the racetrack was including for days when there was no live racing  compared to earned on the lodge based terminals for a facility wide average of per vlt per day 
management believes that the increase from video slots to at the lodge will result in a higher overall net win for the facility 
both to maximize the company s investment in its racetrack based video slots and associated amenities  and to relieve overcrowding in the speakeasy  the company intends to encourage patrons to use the racetrack s video slots 
management may offer free or reduced price food and beverage as well as providing more entertainment at the racetrack in order to attract patrons 
if this strategy proves successful  mountaineer park will likely increase the number of days it opens its track based video slot and food and beverage facilities

in parimutuel wagering  patrons bet against each other rather than against the operator of the facility or with pre set odds 
the total wagering handle is composed of the amounts wagered by each individual according to the wagering activity 
the total amounts wagered form a pool of funds from which winnings are paid based on odds determined solely by the wagering activity 
the racetrack acts as a stakeholder for the wagering patrons and deducts from the amounts wagered a take out or gross commission  from which the racetrack pays state and county taxes and racing purses 
the company s parimutuel commission rates are fixed as a percentage of the total wagering handle or total amounts wagered 
the company earned an average commission rate of in each of the past three years

twelve months ended december live racing parimutuel handle   simulcast racing parimutuel handle   less patrons winning tickets   state and county parimutuel tax   purses and horsemen s association   revenues parimutuel commissions   for the twelve months ended december   live handle rose by million to million  an increase of compared to million for the same period in simulcast racing handle for the year ended was million  an increase of million from the year ended management believes these increases resulted primarily from increased video lottery attendance and cross marketing from such activity

for the august running of the west virginia derby  mountaineer park s race participants were paid  in a single day  with  funded by the state racing commission for the feature race 
while management is encouraged by the million increase in parimutuel handle and  increase in revenue  it does not view the increases in handle and revenues as significant in comparison to the increases in purses 
management continues to believe that periodic increases in average daily purses and purses for stakes races will attract higher quality racehorses 
management believes that over time such increases and improvements should lead to increased live racing handle  or alternatively smaller decreases 
management also believes that the enhanced quality of racehorses should improve the company s prospects in export simulcasting 
commencement of export simulcasting activity would not only create a new source of revenue but the anticipated related increase in gross dollars wagered on the company s live races should also generate increases in live handle as a greater and more diverse wagering pool lessens the impact a particular wager will have on the pay off odds 
management intends to continue its policy of increasing average daily purses though not necessarily in the winter months as well as sponsoring substantially increased stakes races and attempting to develop an export simulcast business 
management does not expect results from racing operations to improve materially  despite larger daily purses  stakes races  better horses  and reduced costs  unless and until mountaineer park also commences export simulcasting 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will successfully commence export simulcasting or that the anticipated results will be realized

the company s increase in revenues in were accompanied by a increase in cost of revenues  a increase in marketing and promotions expense  a increase in general and administrative expenses  and a increase in depreciation and amortization 
the increased marketing and promotion expenses were due primarily to the continued broadcast of the company s hancock county the action s closer than you think infomercial  increases in direct mail  print  radio and television advertising and increased prize giveaways

see results of discontinued operations and note of the notes to the company s audited financial statements for the years ended december   and year the company has analyzed year issues with its computer and software advisors and has assessed the impact of year issues on the company s operations 
manufacturer s documentation of year compliance has been reviewed during this assessment 
all information technology items  both software and hardware  are year compliant except for one software package being used by the video lottery department 
the one software package that is not compliant is igt s sams system 
this system is the central communication package that allows communication between the igt vlt s on site and the lottery commission software in charleston  wv 
the solution to this year noncompliance must be agreed upon by all four west virginia tracks 
the company determined that it would be more economical to replace the current sams system than to modify it so that it is year compliant  because the system was no longer sufficient to meet the company s anticipated needs irrespective of the year issue and because a new system would generally enhance the company s competitive position in the industry 
the final determination of the replacement system has not been made at this time 
it is anticipated that the selection of the new software will be made within the next three months 
the cost of the replacement system may range from  to  per track 
in the event the system has not been replaced in a timely manner  the company s contingency plan is to modify the existing sams system to be yk compliant 
the company believes that the cost of such modification will not be material 
the company believes that all of its non information systems are year compliant 
the company believes that there are currently no other material year issues to be disclosed 
results of discontinued operations on march   the company s board approved a formal plan to divest the company of certain oil and gas operations the company owned in ohio and michigan through a plan of orderly liquidation 
this decision was based upon several factors including i the anticipated potential of the company s gaming operations and the anticipated time to be devoted to it by management  ii the expiration of section credits  a credit against federal income taxes derived from gas produced from devonian shale and tight sands formations from wells commenced before january  iii the impact of delays in connection with the west virginia supreme court litigation and subsequent passage of enabling legislation for video lottery during which caused management to focus the company s efforts and financial resources on mountaineer park  and iv the company s desire to continue to place its primary emphasis on its gaming and recreational businesses
