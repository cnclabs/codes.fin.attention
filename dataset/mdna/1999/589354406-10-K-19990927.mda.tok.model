year issue the company has established a year compliance plan that is substantially complete 
the compliance plan primarily involves information technology  facilities and equipment and major suppliers 
to date  the company has spent approximately  on reprogramming and software and hardware upgrades relating to year remediation 
total costs related to year compliance are estimated at  the company s year compliance efforts include assessment of at risk systems and technology as well as remediation and testing of affected systems 
remediation of the company s primary computer systems and other critical systems was completed in december the final assessment of all other technology used by the company will be essentially complete by september the remediation of these areas is expected to be completed by november the company does not believe that year issues affecting it facilities and equipment are substantial 
the company  however  conducts most of its business on airport properties and  as such  is dependent on various third parties to complete aspects of year compliance which will ensure that airport operations are not significantly impacted or interrupted 
the company s major suppliers and third parties have been included in a year survey that is still in process 
while the company has no reason to believe that year compliance by these third parties will not be substantially completed on time  the company can give no assurance to that effect 
with respect to major suppliers  the company believes year compliance issues will not affect its ability to continue purchasing jet fuel in sufficient quantities  given the number of alternative sources 
contingency plans are being developed as part of an overall disaster recovery plan  which is in process 
a majority of the company s services are dependent on human resources and commodities that are not technology driven  therefore  contingencies relating to year issues will not have a large bearing on operations 
while not expected  any delays or failures resulting from a year compliance problem would affect the company s ability to bill customers timely and process vendor payments 
because of uncertainties  the actual effects of year issues on the company may be different from its current assessment
