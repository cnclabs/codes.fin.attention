see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of certain environmental matters 
management believes that the impact of domestic inflation on the company has not been material in recent years as inflation rates have remained low 
page market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company manages its ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  the company has  on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and has entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december   no derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt outstanding at december   by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt for a duration of one year would increase interest expense by less than million in foreign currency exchange risk approximately of oregon s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of oregon s reported sales and operating income 
historically  the company s principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and local currency sales in europe principally france and germany 
during the past three years  the company has not used derivatives to manage any significant foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
commodity price risk during  the company purchased approximately million pounds of brass for use in its sporting equipment operations 
the price risk of approximately of these purchases was hedged through the use of copper and zinc futures contracts 
in the near future  the company expects to decrease its use of futures contracts to manage this price risk 
an immediate hypothetical decrease in the futures prices of copper and zinc contracts outstanding at december   would decrease their fair value by million 
in addition  a large quantity of other metals principally lead were purchased by sporting equipment operations in derivatives were not used to manage this price risk 
impact of year issue the company has been evaluating its internal date sensitive systems and equipment for year compliance 
the assessment phase of the year project is substantially complete and included both information technology equipment and non information technology equipment 
based on its assessment  the company determined that it was necessary to modify or replace a portion of its information systems and other equipment 
as of december   the company is approximately complete in the modification or replacement and testing of the critical software  hardware and equipment requiring remediation 
the company expects to be completed by june the company believes that the above modifications and replacements should mitigate the effect of the year issue 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or fail to correct date sensitive problems  the year page issue could have a material impact on the company s operations by disrupting its ability to manufacture and ship products  process financial transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company does not believe that the effect of the year issue on non information technology systems is likely to have a material adverse impact 
finally  the company has reviewed its own products and believes that it has no significant year issues for those products 
the total estimated cost of the year project  including system upgrades  is approximately million and is being funded by operating cash flows 
as of december   costs of million had been incurred 
of the total cost of the project  approximately million is attributable to new software and equipment  which will be capitalized 
the remaining costs will be expensed as incurred 
the company has also communicated with key suppliers and customers to determine their year compliance and the extent to which the company is vulnerable to any third party year issues 
this program will be ongoing and the company s efforts with respect to specific problems identified will depend on its assessment of the risk 
most key suppliers and customers who have replied to our inquiries indicated that they expect to be year compliant on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse effect on the company if third parties do not make the necessary modifications to their systems in a timely manner 
however  management believes that ongoing communication with and assessment of these third parties will minimize these risks 
where needed  the company will establish contingency plans based on actual testing results and assessment of outside risks 
the costs of the year issue and completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
the above statement in its entirety is designated a year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivatives and hedging 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value and establishes specific criteria for the use of hedge accounting 
the company s required adoption date is january  sfas no 
is not to be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the company expects no material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows upon adoption of sfas no 
 but does expect a small reduction in stockholders equity
