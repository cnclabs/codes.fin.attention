general demand 
demand for the company s services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data 
the level of activity among geophysical companies is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for seismic data acquisition activities 
a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
within the last decade  improvements in drilling and production techniques and the acceptance of d imaging as an exploration tool resulted in significantly increased seismic activity throughout the transition zone 
due to this increased demand  the company significantly increased its capacity as measured by drilling units  support equipment and employees 
the additional capacity and related increase in work force led to significant increases in the company s revenue and generally commensurate increases in operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses through the second quarter of beginning in mid  seismic activity in the areas in which the company operates decreased substantially  resulting in corresponding reductions in demand for the company s services and adversely affected results of operations 
during the last nine months  management has taken a number of steps to reduce its capacity and related operating levels in response to the recent sales levels 
results of operations the following discussion provides information related to the results of operations of the company and omni geophysical 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended year ended december  december  operating revenue   operating expense   gross profit   general and administrative expenses   asset impairment and other charges  operating income loss   interest expense   other income income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item   income tax expense benefit income loss before extraordinary item   extraordinary expense from early extinguishment of debt  net of tax net income loss  including minority interest   loss of minority interest net income loss   operating revenues increased  or million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due primarily to increased activity during the first six months of the year 
operating revenues from the company s drilling  aviation and survey divisions increased by million  million and million  respectively  as compared to the year ended december  total revenues for the year ended were million  million and million for the drilling  aviation and survey divisions  respectively 
the company s south american joint venture  completed effective july   produced revenues of million 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in operating payroll increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   due to a increase in the average number of employees  from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  contract services increased million  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to increased demand for surveyors beyond the survey division s staff capabilities 
explosives expense increased million to million for the year ended december  due to the increase in drilling jobs during the year 
insurance expense was million for the year ended december   a increase over december  expense of million due to fleet additions in the aviation division and increases in the number of personnel and vehicles 
repairs and maintenance expense increased to million for the year ended december   and  depreciation expense increased to million for the year ended december  these increases of million and million for repairs and maintenance and depreciation  respectively  are a result of increases in the number and utilization of drilling  aviation and support equipment 
rentals and lease expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to increases in vehicle leases resulting from increased activity 
gross profit increased million  or  from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margins fell from in to in  as a result of the rapid growth during the year related to increases in personnel and equipment and the completion of nine acquisitions and a joint venture  beginning in general and administrative expenses increased million from million in the december  year to million for the year ended december  increases in payroll  payroll taxes and insurance expenses accounted for of this growth as they increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increases in executive management and other personnel to meet the demands imposed by the rapid growth of the company in recent periods  many of which had been deferred as a private company 
however  due to the recent decline in the market environment  the company has realized a significant reduction in the workforce and has implemented a decrease in management payroll costs 
these changes should result in an estimated million in annual savings for also  as a result of heightened activity levels and of being a new public company  the company recognized an increase of million in advertising  promotions  professional services and travel and entertainment expenses from million in december  to million in december  supplies  utilities and communications expense increased million from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the same reasons 
bad debt expense increased million to million in december  of this increase  million is related to the evaluation of certain accounts receivable in the third quarter of as a result of the acquisitions completed during and  amortization expense increased million  from million to million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
taxes and licenses expense was million in  due to franchise taxes 
because of the status of omni geophysical as an llc  there was no related expense for in response to recent market conditions and the resultant decline in certain asset utilization of the company s equipment  the company evaluated certain of its assets for realizability 
the related asset impairment charges relate to a million provision for fixed assets  primarily nine drilling units which became impaired due primarily to reduced demand and environmental impact factors which have restricted their future use  a million write off of seismic data held for sale which became impaired due to recent price declines  and a million additional provision for uncollectible accounts receivable 
in addition  in response to anticipated future market conditions  the company s senior management and board of directors approved a plan to reduce future operating costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the plan involves several factors including the restructuring of senior management and the closing and relocation of certain of its operational facilities 
accordingly  the company has recorded an accrual of severance and lease exit costs of million  and future related severance costs will be charged against this reserve as they are incurred 
the million provision for uncollectible accounts receivable is reported in general and administrative expenses and the remaining charges are reported as asset impairment and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
interest expense decreased  or million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower average interest rates on similar weighted average debt outstanding 
income tax expense was million in  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the combined year ended december  ogc day period ended july  and omni geophysical day period ended december  compared to the year ended december  in thousands of dollars omni geophysical acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ogc in the ogc acquisition on july  in order to provide comparable historical periods for  management has combined the results of operations of ogc for the day period ended july  with the results of operations of omni geophysical for the day period ended december  combined year ended year ended december  december  unaudited operating revenue   operating expense   gross profit   general and administrative expenses   operating income   interest expense  other income income before income taxes and extraordinary item   income tax expense income before extraordinary item   extraordinary expense from early extinguishment of debt  net of tax net income   operating revenues increased  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  internal growth resulting from the increase in industry demand for d seismic data in the transition zone accounted for approximately million  or  of this increase 
in order to meet this demand  the company added seismic drilling units for use in the transition zone during  a increase from the number of such units owned by the company at the end of the remaining increase was due to the increase in the company s operations resulting from the six acquisitions completed during these six acquisitions broadened the company s operations to include helicopter support operations and survey services 
in addition  the company added the rocky mountain region as a primary service area 
the company s aviation division contributed approximately million in revenues  while the company s survey and rocky mountain seismic drilling divisions generated revenues of million and million  respectively in the company employed employees for both field and administrative operations at december  compared to at december   a increase 
operating expenses increased  from million in to million in  due to both internal growth of the company s operations from to and the expanded scope of the company s operations that resulted from the acquisitions described above 
total payroll expense increased in  to million from million in  due to the significant increase in the size of the company s workforce 
repairs and maintenance costs were million in  a increase over repairs and maintenance costs of million  primarily due to the increase in the number and utilization of the company s seismic drilling and transportation equipment 
explosives costs increased in  to million from million in  due to an increase in the number of projects for which the company provided explosives 
depreciation expense increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the increased number of seismic drilling and support equipment units owned by the company  the stepped up basis in such units that resulted from the ogc acquisition and the addition of the aircraft acquired from american aviation 
contract services increased  or million  from million in to million in  primarily due to the survey division s need for additional surveyors 
increased operations resulting from increased demand for the company s services and the acquisitions led to an increase of million  or  in supplies expense from million in to million in rental and lease expense also increased in to million from million in the remaining increase in operating expenses was primarily related to the increase in the size and scope of the company s operations  including a million  or  increase in insurance expense and a million  or  increase in fuel expense 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in gross margins fell from in to in this decline in the company s margin was primarily due to the rapid expansion of the company s operations and the addition of new field crews 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  from million in to million in  primarily due to increases in office personnel to support the company s expanded operations  payroll taxes and insurance expense 
these three items increased  from million in to million in additionally  other components of general and administrative expenses  such as utilities  advertising  office  travel and entertainment  rent and permits  increased  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the expansion of the company s facilities and operations 
professional services and bad debt expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in the company s operations 
amortization of loan costs and goodwill expense increased to million in as a result of the acquisitions completed in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were and in and  respectively 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in  due to increased borrowings used to fund the six acquisitions completed during and the acquisition of additional drilling units  support equipment and helicopters 
income tax expense was million in on december   the company converted from a non taxable entity to a taxable entity and thus became subject to federal and state income taxation 
prior to this conversion  the company had been treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes had been made 
income tax expense for is not indicative of future income tax expense as the company was subject to income taxation for less than one month 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had approximately million in cash compared to approximately million at december  the company had working capital of approximately million at december  compared to approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital was due primarily to higher than normal levels of cash at december  as a result of the completion of its initial public offering of common stock in december cash generated from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the company s primary credit facility is with hibernia national bank the hibernia facility 
the hibernia facility provided the company with an million term loan  a million revolving line of credit to finance working capital requirements and a million line of credit to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the loans under the hibernia facility bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin currently which is calculated quarterly and is based on the company s ratio of average funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization 
the applicable margin can range from to 
the hibernia facility has a final maturity of january   is required to be guaranteed by all of the company s subsidiaries  requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios  imposes certain limitations on the company s ability to pay cash dividends and is collateralized by a mortgage on the company s land and buildings and by substantially all of the company s assets not used as collateral for the cit loans  as defined below 
as of february   the company had approximately million outstanding under the hibernia facility 
on october   the hibernia facility was amended to provide the company with a million bridge loan 
this loan bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin  ranging from to currently and has a maturity date of april  as of february   the company had approximately million outstanding under this loan 
as of february   the company also had approximately million in other loans outstanding  the majority of which approximately million are owed pursuant to agreements with cit  consisting of several asset based financing loans the cit loans 
of the principal outstanding under the cit loans  approximately million bears interest at libor plus the variable rate and matures on july  the proceeds of this portion of the loans were used to finance a portion of the ogc acquisition  and the assets acquired serve as collateral 
the remaining portion of the cit loans were borrowed pursuant to an additional commitment from the lender of up to  or of the cost of the collateral securing amounts advanced under this commitment 
as of february   million of this commitment had been advanced 
amounts advanced under this commitment bear interest at libor plus and are collateralized by various seismic drilling  support equipment and aircraft 
as of december   the company was in violation of certain of its covenants under these agreements 
during march  these violations were waived by hibernia and cit and certain terms of the loan agreements with hibernia were restructured 
the most significant of these terms involved the requirement to repay million on or before july  and the revision of certain of the financial covenants 
the company intends on extending the maturities of all of its indebtedness under the hibernia facility  partially through planned refinancing with other lenders 
if the company is unable to extend its maturities and or refinance the hibernia facility  it may be necessary for the company to seek additional capital and or sell operating assets or divisions to raise funds to satisfy its debt obligations 
management believes that the company will be able to obtain appropriate financing for its operations  although there can be no assurance 
in february  the company privately placed million in subordinated debentures with an affiliate of the company 
the proceeds were used for cash reserves and general corporate purposes 
the notes bear interest at per annum  and mature on march  in connection with these debentures  the company issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants vest equally over the next four years until  unless the debentures are paid in full  in which case  those warrants that have not become exercisable will become void 
all warrants that become exercisable will expire on march  as of february   remaining indebtedness includes i  owed to delta surveys  inc interest rate  march  maturity date  ii  incurred in connection with the formation of omni geophysical march  maturity date  and iii approximately  owed to finance and insurance companies incurred to finance certain of the company s insurance premiums 
historically  the company s capital requirements have primarily related to the purchase or fabrication of new seismic drilling equipment and related support equipment  the purchase of helicopters and business acquisitions 
the company made capital expenditures of approximately million to purchase or construct new assets during the year ended december   including million in cash and stock for the acquisition of eagle surveys international  inc  million in cash and stock for the acquisition of coastal turbines  inc  million in cash for the acquisition of hamilton drill tech  inc 
and million in cash  stock and equipment for the bolivian joint venture  million for drilling and support equipment  million for survey and support equipment  million for helicopters and aviation support equipment  and million for the expansion of corporate headquarters 
the company currently expects to make capital expenditures of approximately million in as of february   the company is committed to million of the estimated capital expenditures for impact of year compliance the year yk issue is the result of computerized systems being written to store and process the year portion of dates using two digits rather than four 
date aware systems ie  any system or component that performs calculations  comparisons  sequencing  or other operations involving dates may fail or produce erroneous results on or before january  because the year will be interpreted as the year state of readiness 
the company has been pursuing a strategy to ensure all its significant computer systems will be able to process dates from and after january   including leap years  without critical systems failure yk compliant or yk compliance 
computerized systems are integral to the operations of the company  particularly for accounting and operations control 
progress of the yk plan is being monitored by senior management 
the company believes all critical components of the plan are on schedule for completion by the end of the second quarter of the majority of computerized date sensitive hardware and software components used by the company are covered by maintenance contracts with the vendors who originally implemented them 
almost all of these vendors have been contacted regarding yk compliance of their products 
where necessary  software modifications to ensure compliance will be provided by the appropriate vendors under their maintenance contracts 
information technology and non information technology systems 
the bulk of computerized business systems processing is provided through commercial third party software licensed by the company 
this software has been tested for compliance and the company believes that it is yk compliant 
additionally  the company is currently in the process of investigating more sophisticated accounting software packages to meet their reporting and operational needs 
the software conversion is scheduled for completion during the second quarter of an assessment of all embedded systems contained in the company s buildings  equipment and other infrastructure has been completed 
these assessments revealed the need to upgrade the current phone system 
this process will be completed by the second quarter of third party risks 
the company s computer systems are not widely integrated with the systems of its suppliers or customers 
the primary potential yk risk attributable to third parties would be from a temporary disruption in certain material and services provided by third parties 
the company has contacted all significant vendors regarding the vendor s state of readiness and contingency plans 
to date  no material adverse information has been received 
additionally  effective november   yk compliance requirements have been included in all purchasing contracts 
costs to address the yk issues 
based on current information  the company believes that the cost of yk compliance will not be significant and will be provided for through its normal operating and capital budgets 
these estimates are management s best estimates  which are derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modifications and other factors 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies will be converted on a timely basis or that failure to convert will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
risks of the yk issues 
based on preliminary risk assessment work conducted thus far  the company believes the most likely yk related failures would probably be temporary disruptions in certain materials and services provided by third parties  which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
contingency plans 
although the company believes the likelihood of any or all of the above risks occurring to be low  specific contingency plans to address certain risk areas will be developed  as needed beginning in the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by yk problems or related costs 
cautionary statements this annual report contains forward looking statements 
such statements include  without limitation  statements regarding the company s expectations regarding revenue levels  profitability and costs  the expected results of the company s business strategy  and other plans and objectives of management of the company for future operations and activities 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include  without limitation  the company s dependence on activity in the oil and gas industry  risks associated with the company s rapid growth  the absence of a combined operating history of the company and the companies it has recently acquired whose operations differ in many cases from the company s traditional transition zone seismic drilling operations  risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  dependence on a relatively small number of significant customers  seasonality and weather risks  the hazardous conditions and difficult terrain in which the company operates  risks associated with the company s international expansion  and risks arising from year information technology issues 
many of these factors are beyond the control of the company
