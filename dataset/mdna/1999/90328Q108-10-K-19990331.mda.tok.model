item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and associated risks certain matters discussed herein are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based largely on the company s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  economic  competitive  regulatory  growth strategies  available financing  and other factors discussed elsewhere in this report and the documents filed by the company with the sec 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the forward looking information contained in this report will  in fact  occur 
overview and recent developments the company commenced operations upon the completion of its first acquisition in october the company has historically grown through acquisitions of diagnostic imaging centers and businesses 
the company s operating performance is substantially dependent upon its ability to integrate the operations of acquired facilities into the company s infrastructure and reduce operating expenses of acquired entities  its ability to deliver equivalent service to clients immediately after an acquisition without significant interruption or inconvenience  its ability effectively to market its facilities to physicians requiring imaging services  and various other risks associated with the acquisition and operation of medical businesses  particularly in the increasingly competitive and cost conscious managed care environment  including expenses associated with the integration of the acquired businesses and the negotiation of favorable contracts with third party payors 
if the company is unable to manage these risks  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company reports revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including estimated contractual adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
the company s revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected by the current trend in the healthcare industry toward cost containment  continuing governmental budgetary constraints  reductions in reimbursement rates  changes in the mix of the company s patients and other changes in reimbursement for healthcare services  among other factors  which may put downward pressure on revenue per scan 
see business clients and payors and business regulation and government reimbursement 
during and  the company grew primarily through acquisitions of facilities from independent owners 
in  there was a significant decrease in acquisition activity by the company due to constraints on the company s financial resources and the need to consolidate prior acquisitions 
in late  the company announced  and throughout the company pursued  a four part strategy to i reduce operating costs  ii divest non core and underperforming assets  iii reduce and refinance debt  and iv develop new facilities and engage in prudent acquisitions 
the company implemented a cost reduction plan in the first quarter of  including a significant reduction in nonessential staff  consolidation of four billing offices and four regional operational offices to three of each  retention of ge business solutions to conduct a company wide efficiency and savings review  an emphasis on centralized purchasing  and other consolidation synergies 
the company expects to realize additional savings throughout as a result of these efforts 
the second part of the company s corporate strategy was a review and sale of all non core assets and underperforming facilities 
as a result  the company disposed of its mobile imaging operations and its radiation oncology interests in order to more closely focus on the company s core business of fixed site mri and multi modality imaging facilities 
to accomplish this  in may  the company sold its mobile subsidiary  mdi  for million in cash less debt assumed of approximately million 
also in may  the company sold its interests in uscc for million in cash  promissory note and assumption of certain liabilities 
in addition  as a result of this review process  in november the company disposed of its underperforming nuclear imaging centers by selling its interest in ush for million in cash  promissory notes and assumption of certain debt 
in march  ush prepaid its outstanding notes to the company 
in january and february of  in two separate transactions  the company sold its interest in certain subsidiaries located in texas  for an aggregate price of million in cash  a promissory note and assumption of certain liabilities 
the proceeds from the sales of both non core assets and underperforming facilities were used by the company to reduce debt and to bolster the company s cash reserves 
due to financial market conditions in  the company decided to postpone a refinancing of its long term debt 
however  in addition to the significant debt reduction realized by the sales described above  in december and january the company completed the repurchase in the open market of million aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated debentures due for million  resulting in a decrease in long term debt and related interest expense 
three new facilities were opened in however  because new center development and  to a large extent acquisitions were intended to be dependent upon refinancing long term debt  which did not occur in  the company made only one acquisition during as a result of the events of  the company has been able to reduce its debt and otherwise improve its balance sheet 
the company believes that although it operates fewer facilities  it is now significantly stronger financially and has narrowed its focus to its core business 
the company s strategy for will be to continue the cost and debt reduction elements of its strategy  divest a few remaining underperforming centers  seek advantageous refinancing when and as market conditions permit  and pursue its multi faceted long term strategy as more fully described in part i  item i business

year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming and embedded code that may exist in computer systems as of january  systems and applications that use two digits to store the years might produce unpredictable results when their digits turn to double zero on january  the issues are whether such code exists in the company s mission critical applications and or computer hardware and if that code will produce accurate date sensitive calculations on or after january   and whether certain embedded applications that control certain medical imaging systems should be upgraded to ensure year compliance and the cost of such upgrades  if any 
the company has established a multi phased year readiness program consisting of an assessment phase  planning phase  implementation phase  testing certification phase and a recovery plan phase and a timetable to address year compliance issues for all of its internal information technology it consisting of computer software  hardware  bundled components  development and support tools 
the company has adopted a rigorous battery of tests to ensure year compliance in its it 
the majority of the pcs in use throughout the offices and facilities were purchased within the past two years 
the company will be using testing products to test the pcs basic input output system 
as a part of the assessment and planning phases  the company performed a ground up review of its software application design and application code review processes to ensure year compliance from project initialization to completion 
in the event that any compliance issues are identified during the implementation or testing certification phases  the company will  through its internal systems support programs  provide the necessary corrections  upgrades  and software releases as part of the recovery plan phase to make all software and services year compliant 
in the event that there is a year failure during the transition to the next millennium  the company is prepared through its comprehensive recovery plan phase 
characteristics of the plan include making additional hardware  r d support and client support personnel available 
the company s primary billing and collection  accounting  word processing  spreadsheet and small database applications have all been warranted by the manufacturers to be year compliant 
the underlying operating systems and network software are also warranted to be year compliant 
the company s compliance policy requires that new computer applications and or hardware equipment acquired by the company be warranted as year compliant by the manufacturer 
to ensure that all purchased business systems hardware and software components will operate reliably into the new millennium  the company is verifying that all suppliers of services and products have effective year compliance processes 
the company is reviewing the computer applications of its significant payors  consisting of medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  to determine whether such applications will be upgraded before january  news reports have indicated that various agencies of the federal government  including hcfa which administers medicare  may have difficulty becoming fully year compliant before january  the company is obtaining written confirmation from each of its private insurance carriers and medicare that the carrier is year compliant 
the company s assessment and planning phases with respect to it issues have been completed at a cost of approximately  the next phase to be executed is the implementation phase to be followed by the testing certification phase 
the company plans to complete its year readiness program for it issues by the end of may the cost of completing the company s it year project is estimated to be  all of which is to be expensed in operations 
the company has completed approximately of its it year project 
the company anticipates completing its assessment and planning phases for non it imaging systems for year issues by the end of the third quarter of the company is testing of the imaging equipment ct and mri in its facilities and has completed approximately of its facility reviews 
to date  the company has tested at least one of every type of other system owned and has determined that there are no substantial year related issues that need to be addressed 
as part of the implementation phase  the company has completed conversion on about of its non compliant equipment  which represents approximately of the company s total imaging equipment 
all testing and conversion of critical and non critical medical imaging systems is scheduled for completion by the end of the third quarter of the majority of the costs associated with replacements or upgrades necessary to achieve year compliance are covered under service contracts providing minimum financial exposure to the company 
the majority of the upgrades not covered under service contracts include features enhancements that are beneficial to the company s operations 
the costs of such upgrades will be depreciated over the remaining life of the upgraded asset 
although no material funds have been expended to date  the company expects to incur expenses of approximately  in connection with its review of non it medical imaging systems  which includes all of the testing and repairs required to attain year compliance 
the company will include non it year compliance expenses in operations in the periods in which they are incurred 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of the impact of year issues on the company s operations is that the company s collection of cash could be disrupted if payors whose it is not year compliant are unable to submit payments to the company 
the financial impact of such a disruption could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct normal business operations 
however  the company believes that the majority of its payors could process payments manually in the event of a computer system failure 
because of the nature of the uncertainty surrounding year issues  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment will be correct nor that a failure resulting from the impact of year issues on the company s operations will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition
