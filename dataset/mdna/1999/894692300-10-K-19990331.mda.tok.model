the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations made in the company s forward looking statements in this annual report or elsewhere 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  specifically any current reports on form k filed by the company 
some risks and uncertainties of the company that should be considered by the reader include the adverse results of operations that the company has experienced have been declining  and the company s operating results were profitable during the last quarter of although the company expects the trend of improved operating results to continue  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience adverse results of operations in the future 
the company has had net losses in each period of its operations since its inception  except for two quarters including the most current one  and it had an accumulated deficit at december  of million 
the computer industry  including the information access  document management  imaging and optical disk storage segments  is highly competitive  and is characterized by rapid and continuous technological change 
the company s future profitability will depend on  among other things  market acceptance of the company s products and on the company s ability to develop in a timely fashion enhancements to existing products or new products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to market successfully its current products  develop and market enhancements to existing products or introduce new products 
ii year readiness the year computer problem originated from programmers writing software code that used two digits instead of four to represent the year 
after december   computers and software may incorrectly assume that the year is rather than this could lead to system failures and disruptions to activities and operations 
in addition  year is a leap year  which may further exacerbate incorrect calculations  functions or system failures 
at this time it is difficult to predict the effects such disruptions could have and the liabilities that any company may face as a result of these failures 
moreover  companies must not only consider their own products and computer systems  but also the year readiness of any third parties  including principal vendors 
state of readiness the company became aware in of its potential year issues and established a plan to assess its year issues and develop an overall strategy 
in  the company began an assessment of its products  its own information technology it and non it systems and the company s vendors to determine whether they are or will be year ready 
to ensure that the it and non it systems are  or will be  year ready  surveys of the company s products  services and systems were conducted 
these included audits and analyses of the company s internal it systems including hardware and software  assessment of critical non it systems  and surveys on principal vendors as to year readiness 
the company identified several internal it and non it systems that were not year ready 
these internal systems have either been replaced or modified with year ready systems or will be upgraded to the year ready product 
all internal system upgrades are expected to be completed by the third quarter of the company has received written assurances from material principal vendors as to year readiness within that timeframe 
the majority of the company s efforts regarding year readiness focused on the company s products  specifically software applications 
as an integral part of the company s assessment of whether its software products are year ready it has established a year test force the test force 
the test force has been tasked with providing testing and validation of the company s year readiness of its software products currently being sold to its customers 
the company believes that the current versions of the treev suite of software products are year ready 
customers using versions other than current versions of the software products have been given the opportunity  pursuant to maintenance plans or upgrade options  to receive current versions of the software 
ii costs to address year readiness issues the calculation of costs incurred has been limited to bringing the company s software products  and its own it and non it systems to year readiness or to accelerating replacement systems to become year ready 
costs incurred in the normal maintenance of the company s it and non it systems are not included 
the total cost of the year readiness project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to enhancements of the company s software products and the purchase of new it and non it systems which will be capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations 
to date  the company has incurred approximately   expensed and  capitalized related to the assessment and validation efforts on the year readiness project and the development of a modification plan and purchase of new it and non it systems and systems modifications 
the costs of the year readiness project and the date by which the company believes it will complete the year readiness modifications are based on management s best estimates and are based on certain assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in the year readiness area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes 
company s contingency plans at the present time  the company anticipates that essential software products and it and non it systems will be validated as year ready in all material respects 
this belief is based on the progress to date and the assessed degree of difficulty associated with the remaining phases to achieve year readiness 
contingency plans are under development and the company anticipates that acceptable alternatives will be available in the event that a contingency arises 
these contingency plans generally anticipate use of alternative vendors for hardware and operating systems 
nevertheless  it is not possible for the company to fully assess the likelihood or magnitude of consequences of year issues  should representations made by vendors prove to be in error 
year information and readiness disclosure act this section captioned year readiness  as well as other statements herein or otherwise relating to the year issues  are year readiness disclosures pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act

while the company believes that it can continue to meet the requirements of the nasdaq stock market  any ability to trade on a national exchange could adversely impact the value of the company s stock
