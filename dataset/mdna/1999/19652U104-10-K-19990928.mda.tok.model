results of operations as an aid to understanding the company s operating results  the following table indicates the percentage relationships of income and expense items to total revenue for the line items included in the consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended june   and  and the percentage change in those items for the years ended june  and  from the prior year 
as a percentage of total revenues percentage change from prior year for the years ended june  for the years ended june  line items sales and service cost of sales and services gross profit marketing and selling operating  gen l and admin research and development total operating expenses earnings from operations 

other income  net earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues were million for the year ended june   compared to million for the prior year  an increase of 
of total revenues  outsourcing services contributed approximately and in the fiscal years and  respectively  while medical products contributed approximately and in the fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in total revenues is attributable to the growth of outsourcing services  which had an increase in revenues of in fiscal compared to fiscal the company s revenue growth was also attributable to the emphasis on proprietary products represented by the acquisition of ips in october and the start up of biomed in april collectively  ips and biomed contributed approximately million of revenue during the year ended june  compared to million in fiscal gross margins increased to for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  the increase in the company s margins is a result of the shifting composition of the company s revenues between outsourcing services and medical products 
marketing and selling expenses increased by for the year ended june   as compared to the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the growth in sales and the acquisition of ips  the cmed automation division and the start up of biomed 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of total revenue were for both fiscal years ended june  and operating  general and administrative expenses increased by for the year ended june   compared to the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the acquisition of ips  the cmed automation division  the start up of biomed and the overall growth of the company 
as a percentage of revenues  operating  general and administrative expenses decreased to from in the prior year 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased by compared to the prior year 
during fiscal year  research and development expenses were attributable to rf solid state amplifier systems  year software tools and database and the freshair system 
consistent with the company s operating plans  the company continues to pursue the acquisition or development of new or improved technology or products 
should the company identify any such opportunities  the amount of future research and development expenditures may increase 
net other income and expenses increased to  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  the increase is attributable to a higher short term investment balance during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year included in the june  balance is a  write down in an investment in an early stage  drug delivery company that was behind schedule in developing its proprietary technologies 
the fiscal year and consolidated statements of operations contain a net tax provision of million and million  respectively

 which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences  based on enacted tax laws  of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets  liabilities and carryforwards 
sfas no 
requires recognition of deferred tax assets for the expected future effects of all deductible temporary differences  loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are then reduced  if deemed necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits which  based on current circumstances  are not expected to be realized 
during fiscal year  the company determined the valuation allowance was no longer required 
in fiscal year  the company reduced its valuation allowance by  for the utilization of prior years nol in the current year and certain deferred tax assets that the company believed would be fully utilized 
the effective tax rate during fiscal year was  compared to during fiscal year the company recorded net income of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  earnings per share for the year ended june  were  calculated on  diluted weighted average shares outstanding  compared to 
in the prior year calculated on  diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
this increase in net income is attributed to the growth in the company s revenues  an increase in gross margins by for the fiscal year compared to  and having the combination of operating  general and administrative expenses and marketing and selling expenses increase at a slower rate than revenues 
the company evaluated its overall business in fiscal year and  as a result  increased its market focus 
the company has continued to refine its market focus during and management is dedicated to improving operating results through consistent performance  improved sales levels and cost reductions 
generally  the marketplace for outsourcing services and medical products is expected to remain strong and competitive  with significant opportunities for companies that can develop low cost  high quality products in a timely manner 
the current targeted markets are diagnostic and laboratory instruments  imaging and power systems  therapeutic instruments  software  and hospital services 
the company believes the targeted markets represent a us market of billion or more per year  with forecasted annual growth rates of approximately to 
there are no assurances that management will be successful in achieving improved operating results

information systems and the year issue as is the case for most other companies using computers in their operations  the company and its subsidiaries are in the process of addressing the year problem 
the company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to upgrade its information technology and manufacturing computer software to programs that will consistently and properly recognize the year many of the company s systems include new hardware and packaged software recently purchased from vendors who have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances from vendors that timely updates will be made available to make all remaining purchased software year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to test and reprogram or replace all of its software for year compliance 
the company does not believe that its proprietary products or any of its outsourcing services involve any material year risks 
in addition to reviewing its internal systems  the company has received confirmation from most of its significant vendors concerning year compliance and it is in the process of obtaining assurances from the remainder 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies that interact with the company will be sufficiently year compliant so as to avoid an adverse impact on the company s operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not presently anticipate that the costs to address the year issue will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
present estimated cost for remediation is less than  as of june   the company had spent approximately  on the year issue 
the company presently anticipates that it will complete its year assessment and remediation by september  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing its year remediation plan according to the anticipated schedule 
in addition  the company may be adversely affected by the inability of other companies whose systems interact with the company to become year compliant and by potential interruptions of utility  communications or transportation systems as a result of year issues 
although the company expects its internal systems will be year compliant as described above  the company intends to prepare a contingency plan that will specify what it plans to do if it or important external companies are not year compliant in a timely manner 
the company expects to complete its contingency plan by september  new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
delays the effective date of sfas no 
to financial quarters and financial years beginning after june  the company does not typically enter into arrangements that would fall under the scope of statement no 
and thus  management believes that statement no 
will not significantly affect its financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors the statements contained in this report which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward looking statements 
in addition  the company may  in discussions of its future plans  objectives and expected performance in periodic reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission or documents incorporated by reference therein and in written and oral presentations made by the company  include projections or other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of or section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such projections and forward looking statements are based on assumptions which the company believes are reasonable  but are by their nature inherently uncertain 
in all cases  there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove correct or that projected events will occur  and actual results could differ materially from those projected 
some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ from any such projections or other forward looking statements follow 
variability of operating results the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the volume and timing of revenue from customer orders 
the volume and timing of revenue from customer orders varies due to discounts extended to customers due to growth in project size and cost caused by unfunded changes in the scope of a project or for reasons related to project performance  variation in demand for the customer s products as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions  suspension or cancellation of a customer s development project for reasons which may or may not be related to project performance  suspension or cancellation of a customer s r d budget for reasons often unrelated to the project  a change in a customer s r d strategy as a result of sale or merger of the customer to another company  and delays in projects associated with the approval process for changes to a project 
because the company s outsourcing services business organization and its related cost structure anticipate supporting a certain minimum level of revenues  the company s limited ability to adjust its short term cost structure may compound the adverse effect of any significant revenue reduction 
any one of these factors or a combination thereof could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that the company s operating results may from time to time be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s securities would likely be adversely affected 
customer risk factors the company s success depends on the success of its customers and their products that are developed or manufactured by the company 
any unfavorable developments or adverse effects on the sales of those products or its customers businesses could have a corresponding adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its customers and their products and  accordingly  the company are generally subject to the following risks competitive environment the medical products industry is highly competitive  subject to significant technological change  and requires ongoing investment to keep pace with technological developments and quality and regulatory requirements 
the medical products industry consists of numerous companies  ranging from start up to well established companies 
the competitors of the company s customers may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that will be better accepted in the marketplace than the products manufactured by the company for its customers or that would render its customers technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
some of the company s customers are emerging medical technology companies that have competitors and potential competitors with substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and substantially greater experience in developing and commercializing new products 
the company s customers may not be successful in marketing or distributing their products  or may not respond to pricing  marketing or other competitive pressures or the rapid technological innovation demanded by the marketplace and  as a result  may experience a dramatic drop in product sales  which would have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
uncertain market acceptance of new products  product obsolescence there can be no assurance that the company s customers will be able to gain any significant market acceptance for the products developed or manufactured for them by the company 
market acceptance may depend on a variety of factors  including educating the target market regarding the use of a new procedure and convincing healthcare payers that the benefits of the product and its related treatment regimen outweigh its costs 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
some of the company s customers  especially emerging medical technology companies  have limited or no experience in marketing their products and may be unable to establish effective sales and marketing and distribution channels to successfully commercialize their products 
customer regulatory compliance the fda regulates many of the products developed and manufactured by the company for its customers  and requires certain clearances or approvals before new medical devices can be marketed 
as a prerequisite to any introduction of a new device into the medical marketplace  the company or its customers must obtain necessary product clearances or approvals from the fda or other regulatory agencies 
there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
certain medical devices manufactured by the company may be subject to the need to obtain premarket approval from the fda  which requires substantial preclinical and clinical testing and may cause delays and prevent introduction of such instruments 
other instruments can be marketed only by establishing substantial equivalence to a predicate device in a k premarket notification 
in addition  products intended for use in foreign countries must comply with similar requirements and be certified for sale in those countries 
a customer s failure to comply with the fda s requirements can result in the delay or denial of approval to proceed with the device 
delays in obtaining regulatory approval are frequent and  in turn  can result in delaying or canceling customer orders from the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will obtain or be able to maintain all required clearances or approvals for domestic or exported products on a timely basis  if at all 
the delays and potential product cancellations inherent in the regulatory approval and ongoing regulatory compliance of products developed or manufactured by the company may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  reputation  results of operations and financial condition 
customers future capital requirements some of the company s customers  especially emerging medical technology companies  are not profitable and may have little or no revenues  but they have significant working capital requirements for which the customer may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
adequate funds for their operations may not be available when needed  if at all 
insufficient funds may require a customer to suspend its research and development spending  delay development of a product  clinical trials if required or the commercial introduction of a product 
depending on the significance of a customer s product to the company s revenues or profitability  any adverse effect on a customer resulting from insufficient funds could result in an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
uncertainty regarding third party reimbursement governmental and insurance industry efforts to reform the healthcare industry and reduce healthcare spending have affected  and will continue to affect  the market for medical devices 
adverse governmental regulation relating to the company s or its customers products which might arise from future legislative  administrative or insurance industry policy cannot be predicted and the ultimate effect on private insurer and governmental healthcare reimbursement is unknown 
government and commercial insurance companies are increasingly vigorous in their attempts to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products even if approved for marketing by the fda 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and commercial payers for uses of the company s new and existing products  the market acceptance of these products and the company s profitability would be adversely affected 
reliance on major customers in the fiscal year ended june   three customers accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
in the fiscal year ended june   two customers accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
in the fiscal year ended june   three customers accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
as a contract developer and manufacturer  the company has historically obtained a significant share of its revenue from a small number of customers  but the identity of those major customers tends to change from year to year 
a significant reduction or delay in orders or payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
competition the company faces competition from a variety of sources  including consulting  commercial product development and manufacturing companies 
competition also comes from commercial and university research laboratories and from current and prospective customers who evaluate the company s capabilities against the merits of designing  engineering and manufacturing products internally 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  research and development manufacturing resources than the company 
competition from any of the foregoing sources could place pressure on the company to accept lower margins on its contracts or lose existing or potential business  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of certain of its key managerial  technical and engineering personnel  particularly its president and chief executive officer  john v 
atanasoff ii  and the company s continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly qualified engineering  technical and managerial personnel experienced in commercializing medical products 
competition for such personnel is intense  the available pool of qualified candidates is limited and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key engineering  technical and managerial personnel or that it can attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly qualified engineering  technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the loss of mr 
atanasoff or any of the company s other key personnel or the inability of the company to hire  train  assimilate or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
compliance with regulatory requirements the company is subject to a variety of regulatory agency requirements in the united states and foreign countries relating to many of the products that it develops and manufactures for its customers 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals and otherwise remaining in regulatory compliance can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the fda inspects manufacturers of certain types of devices before providing a clearance to manufacture and sell such device  and the failure to pass such an inspection could result in delay in moving ahead with a project 
the company is required to comply with the fda s qsr requirements for the manufacture of medical products 
in addition  in order for the company s instruments to be exported and for the company and its customers to be qualified to use the ce mark in the european union  the company maintains iso en certification which  like the qsr  subjects the company s operations to periodic surveillance audits 
to ensure compliance with qsr requirements  the company expends significant time  resources and effort in the areas of training  production and quality assurance 
failure to comply with qsr regulations or other fda or applicable legal requirements can lead to warning letters  government sanctions and serious penalties 
in addition  the continued sale of any products manufactured by the company may be halted or otherwise restricted 
any such actions could have an adverse effect on the willingness of customers and prospective customers to do business with the company 
in addition  any such noncompliance or increased cost of compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
product recalls  product liability and insurance most of the products the company designs or manufactures are medical devices  many of which may be used in life sustaining or life supporting roles 
the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture or use of these products may be small or nonexistent 
if a product designed or manufactured by the company is found to be defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  to improper use of the product or to other reasons  the product may need to be recalled  possibly at the company s expense 
furthermore  the adverse effect of a product recall on the company might not be limited to the cost of the recall 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could result in substantial costs  loss of revenues and a diminution of the company s reputation  each of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the manufacture and sale of the medical devices developed and manufactured by the company involves the risk of product liability claims 
although the company generally obtains indemnification from its customers for products it manufactures to the customers specifications and in addition maintains product liability insurance  there can be no assurance that the indemnities will be honored or the coverage of the company s insurance policies will be adequate 
in addition  the company generally provides a design defect warranty and indemnifies its customers for failure of a product to conform to design specifications and against defects in materials and workmanship 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  in sufficient amounts  or at all 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage or any material claim for which insurance coverage was denied or limited and for which indemnification was not available could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
year issue many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date code field  and were not designed to account for the upcoming change in the century 
as a result  such systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and accounts receivable modules  inventory and receivables systems  customer services  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and end products 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on systems of external business enterprises such as distributors  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governmental entities for accurate exchange of data 
the company does not believe that its proprietary products or any of its outsourcing services projects involve any material year risks  and the company does not presently anticipate that the costs to address the year issue will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
even if the internal systems of the company and the systems and software in its proprietary products and its outsourcing products are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts 
if the year issue affects the ability of the company s component suppliers to meet delivery schedules for the components needed to manufacture the company s products  the company may not be able to timely meet its obligations to its customers 
this would likely have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results which could be material 
there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
customer conflicts the medical technology industry reflects vigorous competition among its participants 
although the company generally does not enter into non competition agreements  on occasion the company s agreements prohibit it from working for certain competitors of its customers 
when and if the company does this  its growth may be adversely affected because such agreements would prevent the company from manufacturing instruments for its customers competitors 
any conflicts among its customers could prevent or deter the company from obtaining contracts to manufacture successful instruments  which could result in a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as part of its cash management strategy  had short term investments at june  consisting of approximately million in us treasury and government agency securities and million in commercial paper 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these short term investments to maturity and thus has classified these investments  which are stated at amortized cost that approximates market  as held to maturity 
all of the short term investments mature in less than one year 
the company has completed a market risk sensitivity analysis of these short term investments based upon an assumed increase in interest rates at july  if market interest rates had increased by on july   the company would have had an approximate  loss on these short term investments 
because this is only an estimate  any actual loss due to an increase in interest rates could differ from this estimate
