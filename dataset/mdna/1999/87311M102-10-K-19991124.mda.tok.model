item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
capital resources and liquidity during the year ended august   beginning cash reserves of  were increased by net cash provided from operating activities of  resulting in a total of  in working capital available for use in funding the company s ongoing development and exploration of its oil and gas properties 
the ongoing positive cash flow from operations throughout the year significantly improved the company s ability to increase its core revenues from oil and gas operations  thereby enhancing its ability to overcome the impact of weak oil and gas prices through most of an additional  was obtained during the year  under the existing financing agreement with range energy finance corporation  bringing total borrowings from range to  the financing was specifically for ongoing development of the company s natural gas producing properties in maverick county  texas 
the company applied  of its working capital to fund the expansion and ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
included were drilling and completion costs of  for current year drilling of maverick basin gas and oil wells  plus costs associated with wells drilled during the last quarter of also included were  in d seismic acquisition and reprocessing costs and  in lease extension payments to maintain non producing lease acreage in the company s growing maverick basin lease block 
the company made timely payments on long term debt of  during  including  paid on the range financing agreement 
scheduled payments totaling  were made on the company s remaining long term notes during the remainder of the year 
during the rd quarter of  txco successfully entered into a joint venture agreement with castle exploration company  castle a wholly owned subsidiary of castle energy corporation nasdaq cecx  whereby castle agreed to fund up to  for of all costs to acquire approximately  acres of additional leases  fund a square mile d seismic survey and drill up to gas wells 
in exchange  txco contributed its interest in an  lease to the venture  was named operater and will be carried at no cost  for a interest in the first wells drilled 
additionally  txco will be licensed to share in all seismic data gathered and will earn a working interest in all leases acquired with the funds 
at year end  all d seismic acquisition and processing had been completed  and company geologists and geophysicists were in process of interpreting and evaluating the new data 
during the th quarter of  the company successfully closed another non cash transaction to acquire various oil and gas mineral interests near or adjoining txco s maverick basin leasehold 
in exchange for  shares of its restricted common stock valued at  the company purchased a interest in  acres known as the chittim lease  including a working interest in producing oil and gas wells and associated equipment 
in addition  txco also received a working interest in two separate leases totaling approximately  acres 
as a result of these activities  the company ended fiscal year with negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to this compares to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to at august  working capital weakened during primarily due to cash outlays for its aggressive ongoing development activities and due to timely payments made under the terms of the range financing agreement 
although the company had a working capital deficit at year end  included in current liabilities is  estimated as the debt payment for fiscal under the range financing agreement 
the range debt payments are only due and payable out of each future month s net cash flow from the collateralized producing wells 
should producing well cash flows be less than estimated  the debt repayment will be less  while the reverse is true should cash flows be greater 
due to the company s drilling success in and  it expects substantially all of the range debt to be repaid during fiscal year management is confident of the company s ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  and in its ability to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements 
during the year ended august   beginning cash reserves of  were reduced by net cash used in operating activities of  resulting in a total of  in working capital available used in funding the company s ongoing development and exploration of its oil and gas properties  significantly improving the company s potential to increase its core revenues from oil and gas operations  and enhancing its ability to overcome the impact of continued weakness in oil and gas prices 
throughout fiscal  the company pursued opportunities to enhance its liquidity by the conversion of existing short term trade payables to long term debt and the conversion of debentures into common stock 
management successfully converted separate accounts totaling  in current trade payables into separate notes  with payment terms ranging from to months and interest accruing at rates ranging from to 
further improvements to the company s debt structure were realized by management s election to exercise the company s option to convert its outstanding  debentures to equity 
effective january   the company issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for the outstanding debentures  including accrued interest of  at the conversion price of per share 
in addition to the extremely favorable conversion price for the new issuance  and the elimination of  in future annual interest expense  management s elimination of its primary long term debt significantly enhanced the company s ability to pursue additional sources of equity or debt based working capital 
late in the final quarter of  the company entered into a financing agreement with range energy finance corporation  a subsidiary of range resources corporation nyse rrc  formerly domain energy corporation to initially establish a borrowing ceiling of  during fiscal year the borrowing ceiling was increasd to  the financing was specifically for ongoing development of the company s natural gas producing properties in maverick county  texas 
funds were advanced in exchange for a limited term overriding royalty interest tied to existing and future production from specified depths underlying certain of the company s oil and gas leases in maverick county 
terms provided for repayment of the funds  with interest at  from a specified portion of sales proceeds from all existing and future wells to be drilled on the paloma lease 
by august  the company had borrowed  under the agreement 
throughout the year ended august   the company applied  of its available working capital to fund the ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
this included drilling and completion costs of  associated with the current year drilling of four new maverick basin gas wells  three new williston basin oil wells and costs associated with wells drilled prior to the current fiscal year  plus  for completion of the newest segment of the company s new gas gathering system in maverick county during also included were d seismic acquisitions totaling  over company leases in north dakota and  on the paloma lease in south texas 
additional investments in non producing lease acreage totaled  for the year 
additionally  the company made payments on its long term debt during the year of  included in the total was  paid during the first quarter  in full prepayment of the company s outstanding line of credit with luzerner kantonalbank 
scheduled payments totaling  were made on the company s remaining long term notes during the remainder of as a result of these activities  the company ended fiscal year with positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to this compares to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to at august  while the company s working capital position weakened from the previous year  the results of the company s dramatic drilling success ratio during for new glen rose wells became evident during the first quarter of fiscal year as new wells were placed on production  management was assured in its confidence of continuing significant improvements in the company s ability to meet its ongoing operating cash requirements 
during the first quarter of  the company converted  of its debt into  shares of common stock and raised an additional  cash through the exercise of common stock warrants and sales of common stock 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company successfully closed a large transaction that resulted in its acquiring an additional  net acres of undeveloped oil and gas acreage in the williston basin of north and south dakota and montana for  cash and the issuance of  shares of restricted common stock 
simultaneous with the acquisition  the company sold a net profits interest in future wells on the acreage for  cash 
concurrent with the acquisition of undeveloped acreage and sale of the net profits interest  the company received from the same acquiring parties  cash for a debenture convertible into the company s common stock at per share 
during the same quarter  the company completed an offering under regulation s by successfully selling  shares of its common stock for  and also converted  in previously issued convertible debentures into  shares of common stock 
the result of the above transactions was to significantly enhance the company s operating position by giving it additional acreage to develop as well as the working capital with which to drill 
for the entire year  the company raised  net of expenses  through common stock sales and converted  of convertible debentures into common stock and thereby eliminating an on going cash outlay for interest as well as the future repayment of the debt 
the company also raised  through the sale of the net profits interest in future williston basin wells to be drilled and raised an additional  through new debt financing  which included proceeds from the sale of  in convertible debentures plus proceeds from its existing  line of credit 
a portion of this new capital was used to finance the second quarter acquisition of the company s additional  net acres of williston basin oil leases purchased for  cash plus  shares of the company s common stock 
proceeds were also used to fund the company s loss for the year of  including the payment of interest of  payments on current portion of debt and capital leases of  and for capital and investment expenditures of  capital expenditures included approximately  in equipment   in drilling bonds and deposits   in prepaid loan fees and cumulative advances to exprofuels totaling  most significantly   was invested in the development of the company s oil and gas properties  including the drilling of four maverick basin wells in texas  williston basin wells in north dakota  the acquisition of  of d seismic data and  for expansion of the company s maverick county natural gas pipeline infrastructure 
at august   the company had cash of  and working capital of  on current assets of  and current liabilities of  this compared to a cash position of  and a working capital deficit of  at august  capital requirements the major components of the company s plans  and the requirements for additional capital at august   include the following maverick basin activity during fiscal  the company s plans to drill a minimum of additional wells  in keeping with lease renewal minimum requirements  with a total drilling budget of  two of these wells are scheduled to be drilled under and funded by the castle project at no cost to txco 
the remaining wells are targeted as glen rose reef prospects  each costing approximately  to  to complete or  as a dry hole 
company engineers are planning to test other formations with horizontal drilling techniques with the hope of unlocking additional reserves not previously productive from vertical drilling  due to the formations low permeability 
the horizontal drilling increases the typical gross completion cost of a well by  to  with the company s share being approximately  to  in the event of continuing improvements in realized oil and gas prices  the company can accelerate its drilling program as additional internally generated working capital becomes available during the year 
it can also accelerate the castle program as directed by the funding partner during the year 
estimated expenditures required to maintain the company s interest in its remaining undeveloped south texas leasehold acreage for fiscal are the company has effectively layed off a significant portion of the capital requirements for which it would have otherwise had to provide funding for during fiscal and this capital outlay reduction was made possible by the carried interest feature included in two key strategic joint ventures it entered in during txco will be carried for a interest in the next wells proposed to be drilled under its joint operating agreement with castle exploration company 
upon completion of the new d seismic data set s interpretation  the results from the new  acre d seismic survey should generate a number of new drillable glen rose reef prospects in excess of txco s internal drilling program 
in addition  all of txco s currently remaining d seismic expenditures for both the castle project and the blue star jurassic project are covered entirely by its partners 
williston basin activity due to the continuing uncertainty in crude oil prices and unattractive economics for continued exploration  the company has deferred further expenditures in the williston basin  except for maintaining existing producing properties and the payment of delay rentals and lease extensions on selected leases 
management will continue its efforts to offer its remaining prospects to other industry operators 
delay rentals required to maintain the company s interest in its remaining undeveloped williston basin leasehold acreage for fiscal are  summary of capital resources and liquidity subsequent to the end of fiscal  the company successfully drilled two wells  completing one as a georgetown formation gas well in october drilling on the second well was completed in november  with electric logs indicating the well encountered a foot section of glen rose reef which appears to be gas productive 
the company s net revenues from both wells should increase by  to  per year 
while management is confident it has identified sufficient sources of working capital to carry out its current exploration and development plans on its texas leaseholds  as well as to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business through the end of the new fiscal year  there is no assurance that energy prices will either continue to improve or return to their weakened positions as they were during the first half of should prices weaken  the reduction in revenues could cause the company to re evaluate its expected sources of working capital and reduce its current operating plans 
management is actively involved in ongoing discussions with various domestic and foreign based sources of debt and equity financing that could provide favorably structured funding as required to increase the company s planned drilling activity during fiscal year management remains confident that financial resources will remain available  enabling the company to continue the rapid development of its oil and gas properties and continue to meet its normal operational and debt service obligations 
year over the last three years the company has replaced or upgraded most of the core management information systems used in the company s business 
the company has conducted a review of these systems to verify their compliance with year date codes 
in addition  the company has conducted an inventory  review and assessment of its desktop computers  networks and servers  software applications and packages  and products and services provided by third parties for internal operations to determine whether or not they support year date codes 
the company believes it has successfully completed required modifications to all mission critical applications included in its internal systems 
in addition  the company has contacted its major gas purchasers  gas pipeline carriers  stock transfer agent and banking institutions and received written assurances and or viewed assurances on their websites that they have no material year problems 
the company does not believe the year issue will materially affect its ability to pay its vendors and suppliers  track its assets in the custody of financial institutions or otherwise prevent it from conducting its business on an ongoing basis 
results of operations compared to the company reported net income of  or per diluted share for the year ended august   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the same period in the attainment of profitability was primarily the result of a increase in revenues over levels due primarily to significant new production from new wells placed on line during the year  including gas wells completed late in the last quarter of the prior year 
while very positive  the increases were significantly offset by the weakness in oil and gas prices through the first half of gas sales volume increases also reflect the impact of the first full year of operation of the expanded gas gathering system completed during the latter part of exploration expenses decreased by compared to levels due to the high drilling success in the maverick basin compared to multiple williston basin dry holes drilled or abandoned during the prior year 
abandoned leases and equipment expense decreased by primarily to the non recurring nature of the one time charge off of uneconomical producing properties during due to the oil and gas price collapse during impairment expense decreased by also due to the non recurring nature of the initially large impairment provisions required due to the oil price collapse in the prior year  while lower impairment provisions proved adequate in light of the improvement in realized oil and gas prices during the last half of the current year 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by over levels due primarily to an increase in depletion 
the change in depletion was due to the adverse impact on year end reserve estimates caused by declining oil production and increasing water disposal costs associated with williston basin production 
the decrease in loan fee amortization expense as compared to  reflects the non recurring nature of the prior period s recognition of  in previously capitalized prepaid loan fees due to the conversion of a  debenture in january fiscal loan fee amortization expense has been reclassified for comparative purposes with current year expense 
interest expense increased by over  reflecting a full year of interest charges on borrowings under the range financing agreement entered into during the last quarter of the prior year 
compared to revenues from oil and gas sales increased over as a result of significant new production from the successful completion of the nine new wells during the last part of the  plus the additional production from new gas wells added during lease operating expenses  related directly to the costs of operating the newly producing williston basin oil wells with very high production associated water disposal costs  increased by over the disproportionately higher increase in lease operating expense increases reflects the difference in the company s normal natural gas production expense level versus the significantly higher per unit production cost associated with its williston basin oil production 
exploration expenses  including the costs of unsuccessful wells increased by due to the write off of two high working interest dry holes during the year compared to two very low working interest dry holes in the previous year 
the fall of oil prices at mid year rendered the completion of the wells uneconomical 
abandoned leases and equipment increased to  reflecting the ongoing impact of the fall of oil prices during the year that rendered marginal properties uneconomic to maintain or renew 
included in the non cash charge off for the current year are  in williston basin leases   in zavala county leases south texas  and  in canadian crown leases  all determined to be uneconomic and expiring during the current year due to the continued impact of low oil and gas prices 
also included in the non cash writeoff was the remaining capitalized costs  for the kincaid  a horizontal georgetown test well drilled in maverick county during the third quarter of that failed to produce economic quantities of gas 
pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing properties and non producing mineral leases for impairment 
based on the fall in oil prices during the year and the resulting impact on the updated reserve estimates at year end  the company identified certain producing properties which required impairment 
additionally  non producing leaseholds were reviewed for potential impairment 
certain leases  with expiration dates through december  were identified which will not be renewed 
non cash impairment charges totaling  were recorded at year end including  of williston basin and texas non producing leases set to expire through calendar year additionally  a  impairment was recorded reflecting the excess of unamortized book value over the future realizable reserves primarily related to certain of its williston basin wells 
additional expenses during the year include depreciation  depletion and amortization of  plus current year exploration expenses of  except for the statutory  intangible non cash expenses required for compliance reporting purposes described above and current year exploration expenses  actual operating activities for the year ended august  resulted in positive cash flow from producing operations of  this level of positive cash flow  if sustained  is sufficient to provide for funding of the company s primary administrative operations 
management feels confident this source of internally generated working capital will continue to grow as the company s texas gas production levels expand through fiscal and beyond 
general and administrative costs increased to  from  increases in salaries totaling approximately  were due primarily to a full twelve months of wages in for the increased number of new employee positions required by the company s expansion in operations as a result of the williston basin lease acquisition versus only a partial year for the previous year 
the  decrease in interest income in reflects the lower cash levels in interest bearing accounts during versus the prior year 
compared to revenues from oil and gas sales increased over  to  from  as a result of significant new production from the successful completion of the nine new wells during the last part of the year 
lease operating expenses  related directly to the costs of operating the producing wells  accordingly increased to  from  in exploration expenses  which includes the costs of unsuccessful wells  increased by to  from  with  in dry hole costs related to the james f 
the well was in the process of drilling at august   but subsequently did not produce sufficient hydrocarbons to be economically viable 
although the company may re enter the well and drill another lateral in a different direction  all costs related to the james f were accrued and included in fiscal operations as a loss  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
other costs included non cash expenses of  in abandoned leases  primarily represented by certain expired acreage in canada  as well as depletion and depreciation of  general and administrative costs increased to  from  due primarily to increased salaries for new employee positions required by the company s expansion in operations as a result of the williston basin lease acquisition 
although interest expense decreased by  this was almost all offset by the write off of deferred financing fees on debt converted during the year 
in total  revenues increased  or  to  in from  in cost of sales  including exploration expenses  general and administrative expenses  and abandoned leases  increased  to  in from  in  resulting in an increase in the company s loss from its oil and gas operations to  in from  in the company also incurred a loss on its investment in exprofuels of  compared to  in however  since this investment has been written down to zero dollars  and no additional cash advances are expected after december   advances committed to exprofuels of  for september  to december  were accrued at august  operations should not suffer from this investment in future periods 
as a result of the above  loss from operations increased to  in from  in item a
