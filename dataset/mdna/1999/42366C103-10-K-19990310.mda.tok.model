the planned spin off of the wholly owned subsidiary  core biotech corp  may require an investment by the company in the amount of  these funds would be used by core biotech to pursue the development of ampligen for the treatment of viral diseases 
the remaining funds available as of december  plus the anticipated interest income on short term investments  revenues from product sales in the united states  canada and belgium cost recovery clinical trials and proceeds from the exercise of shareholder warrants should meet the company s cash needs well into the year the company expects to continue its research and clinical efforts for the next several years and may seek to access the equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if the company does not have an immediate need for additional capital 
year compliance the company is dependent upon computers to operate the business and therefore is exposed to year problems 
in the spring of  management initiated a yk compliance program with the following objectives a updating and or replacing aging hardware  b establishing a new platform for data bases  and c assuring company wide yk compliance 
with the assistance of outside consultants  the company has identified that the computer systems used for clinical and manufacturing purposes are not yk compliant 
in order to make these systems compliant  the company elected to replace the computer systems 
management expects to have all computers and systems yk compliant by may  at costs estimated to be between  and  the company s contingency plans are not complete at this time 
we are confident that our new computers and software will be online by may  some thought is being given to outsourcing the computer tasks as a contingency plan 
the company is looking into suppliers that could provide this service 
this approach  if necessary  would be expensive 
risks in a worst case scenario  the company would experience delays in accessing data on patients enrolled in clinical trials 
these delays could slow down regulatory compliance and commercial approval of ampligen by the food and drug administration 
our management of ampligen production and inventories would be slow and time consuming  which could delay shipments of ampligen for clinical trials 
our yk program is expected to significantly reduce our level of uncertainty about the yk problem and  in particular  about the yk compliance and readiness of our material external agents 
we believe that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of our yk program as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced
