income from operations during the third fiscal quarter  as a percentage of net sales  is typically higher than in any other quarter because of product sales mix and other economies of scale caused by the higher sales volume 
the company expects seasonality in its operations to continue 
the company experiences significant seasonal short term swings in its cash position due to sales seasonality and to differences in timing of payments to its vendors and the receipt of payments from its customers 
cash flow has been historically greatest during the third fiscal quarter due to higher seasonal sales 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march    of cash was provided by operating activities 
in the prior year   of cash was provided by operating activities 
at march   the company s cash and investments had decreased by  compared to march   primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  an increase in net investment in inventory as well as the acquisition and funding of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
trade accounts receivable increased  compared to one year ago primarily due to the timing of customer returns and settlement of disputed items  as well as an increase in net sales in the latter part of the fourth quarter 
inventories at march  increased  compared to march   due in part to increased sales activity  further development of specialty retailer distribution programs and the timing of returns to publishers of certain titles 
the increase in inventory was offset  in part  by an increase in accounts payable 
the working capital required to finance inventories is directly related to inventory turnover rate and trade credit terms provided by publishers 
trade credit terms from the company s vendors did not change significantly during fiscal inventory turnover remained consistent between years at approximately four times 
the company had available at march  an unsecured bank line of credit with a maximum borrowing limit of million 
the interest rate on bank borrowings is based on the prime rate and libor rates

such acquisitions  if any  could affect the company s liquidity and capital resources 
impact of inflation the company has been subject to relatively low prevailing inflation rates in all countries in which it operates  with the exception of mexico  during fiscal  and the company has generally been able to adjust its selling prices in all countries in which it operates to offset increased costs of merchandise and expects to be able to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
while the mexico activities are not a significant part of the company s overall operations  the continued high rates of inflation in mexico may result in future foreign currency exchange losses 
computer operations and the year during fiscal and fiscal  the company developed a plan to address anticipated year issues in connection with its data processing and other activities  including non information technology based systems 
the cost for review  analysis  modification and testing of existing computer programs for both internal and external software approximated  and was expensed as incurred 
due to the fact that the company has primarily employed outside consultants for year related work  there has not been any deferral of other information technology related projects  nor has there been a requirement to hire additional personnel solely for year compliance issues 
the company completed the remediation portion of the year project and began its internal testing phase in the fourth quarter of fiscal it is expected that the final testing phase of the year project will be completed by august although there can be no assurances  management believes that the year project  including a documented contingency plan  will be completed by september in contemplation of the possibility that the company s vendors and customers may experience year related difficulties that may affect the company s operations  a committee of information technology and other departmental managers has been formed to consider and develop a contingency plan 
this committee began its development of a contingency plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and it is expected that the documentation of such a plan will be completed by july although  based on a review of its data processing  operating  and other computer based systems  the company does not currently believe that it will experience any significant adverse effects or material unbudgeted costs resulting therefrom  there can be no assurance in that regard 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in or a failure of certain normal activities or operations 
such interruptions or failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
because there is general uncertainty about the year problem  including uncertainty about the year readiness of suppliers and customers  it is not possible to predict whether year problems will occur or what the consequences such problems will have on results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
however  the company s plan to address year issues is intended to minimize  to the extent feasible  the possibility of interruptions of normal operations 
there can  however  be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so
