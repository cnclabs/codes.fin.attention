item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table is derived from the company s statement of operations and sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses loss on factory closure earnings loss from operations other expense earnings loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net earnings loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales decreased by  or  between the years ended december  and sales of the teva line increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a increase 
the increase in teva sales was partially due to an increase in sales under the company s early delivery program in  compared to that in under this program  retailers are encouraged to take early delivery of spring product in the fourth quarter in an effort to expand the length of the selling season 
in addition  the company introduced several successful new styles and experienced a general increase in demand for the teva products 
sales of teva products represented and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net sales of footwear under the simple product line decreased to  from  between the years ended december  and simple sales represented of sales in and of sales in the decrease in simple sales occurred due to a decline in demand for simple products caused by a variety of factors  including competition  an abundance of similar products at retail  and a general decrease in the popularity of the products 
sales of ugg footwear increased to  in from  in  representing of sales for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase in ugg sales was due to a general increase in demand for the products  caused in part by an improved print advertising and public relations campaign in in addition  the company s overall sales declined as the company exited two businesses since the company sold it s interest in the trukke line of winter sport boots effective december  and ceased its business of supplying footwear components for independent factories in the far east during the third quarter of in the aggregate  the reduced sales contribution from these two businesses was  overall  international sales for all of the company s products decreased to  from  representing of net sales in and in this decrease in international sales was caused in part by the reduction in sales of footwear components in the far east  when the company exited that business in the volume of footwear sold worldwide increased to  pairs during the year ended december  from  pairs during the year ended december   for the reasons discussed above 
the weighted average wholesale price per pair sold during the year ended december  decreased by to from for the year ended december  the decrease occurred as a result of an increase in the proportion of footwear sold at closeout prices in compared to  primarily related to the simple line 
cost of sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  gross profit decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the decrease in gross margin during the period was due to several factors 
as a result of the simple sales decline  the company experienced inventory write downs on excess simple inventory  as well as an increase in the volume of simple closeouts 
in addition  the company experienced write downs of teva raw materials inventory  partially as a result of the company s closure of its mexican manufacturing facility  the last remaining company owned manufacturing facility 
the company also experienced increased airfreight costs in compared to lastly  the company announced a product recall on the teva nylon infant sandals during the company recorded a loss of approximately  related to this recall  of which approximately  was included as a reduction of gross profit and approximately  was included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   and increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in in its continuing efforts to improve sales growth  the company increased its advertising and marketing and increased its research and development to improve design as well as to improve the transition from design to production 
accordingly  the company incurred approximately  more in advertising  marketing and promotion costs  including  of in house costs  and approximately  more in research and development costs in than in the company also experienced an increase in warehouse costs of approximately  an increase in teva apparel operating costs of approximately  an increase in costs associated with its management information systems of approximately  an increase in sales sample expenses of approximately  increased european office expenses of approximately  product recall costs of approximately  and severance costs of approximately  in conjunction with the closure of the mexican manufacturing facility in net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared with net interest expense of  for the year ended december   primarily due to increased borrowings on the company s credit facility in compared to for the year ended december   the company experienced an income tax benefit of  as a result of the company s loss for the period  reflecting the company s ability to recover income taxes previously paid 
this represents an effective income tax rate of 
for the year ended december   the company had income tax expense of  representing an effective income tax rate of 
the change in the effective income tax rate is due to certain non deductible expenses  primarily goodwill amortization  which were a greater proportion of earnings loss before income taxes in than in in addition  for california state income tax purposes  net operating losses cannot be carried back to offset income taxes previously paid in prior years and  therefore  the income tax benefit is reduced accordingly 
the company had a net loss of  for the year ended december  as compared with net earnings of  for the year ended december  due to the reasons discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased by  or between the years ended december  and sales of the teva line increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   a increase 
sales of teva products represented and of net sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in teva sales was primarily due to increased demand for this line 
in addition  in early  sales of the teva line were adversely impacted by the excess inventory at retail  which the retailers had carried into from the season 
this situation did not recur in also  in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a spring early delivery program that provided retailers an incentive to bring teva products in for the fourth quarter and expand the length of the selling season 
due to the success of this program approximately to million of teva product was shipped in the fourth quarter of  which the company believes ordinarily would have shipped in the first quarter of net sales of footwear under the simple product line decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the continued repositioning of the simple brand and its distribution  and the non recurrence of last year s demand for certain styles of simple clogs 
net sales of footwear under the ugg product line decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to reduced demand for the company s product offering  resulting from pricing pressures  reduced advertising spending and a carry over of product at retail from overall  international sales for all of the company s products increased to  from  representing of net sales in and in because the increase in the volume of sales of teva footwear products more than offset the decrease in the volume of sales of simple and ugg footwear products  the volume of footwear sold increased to  pairs for the year ended december  from  pairs for the year ended december the weighted average wholesale price per pair sold during the years ended december  and decreased to from 
the decrease was primarily due to a change in the sales mix resulting from the reduction in sales of ugg products in  which have a significantly higher weighted average selling price than the company s other product lines 
in addition  the company experienced a change in the sales mix for simple products  with significantly greater sales of the relatively higher priced clogs and fewer close outs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by the lower volume of teva close outs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cost of sales increased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  gross profit increased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to significantly reduced levels of teva and ugg close outs during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding levels for the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by higher levels of simple close outs during this period 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   and increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase was largely a result of increased royalties payable to the licensor of the teva patents and trademarks due to a change in the sales mix toward teva products 
in addition the company experienced increased legal costs related to disputes with some of the former shareholders of ugg holdings  inc  increased european operating expenses due to the opening and operation of the european office in  increased amortization of intangible assets  increased costs associated with the teva apparel line and an increase in research and development spending 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets was primarily due to the amortization of teva license fees for the five year period beginning september  as well as increased goodwill amortization associated with the ugg acquisition payments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and ugg advertising costs between the years ended december  and december  in  the company also incurred a loss on factory closure aggregating  related to the march closure of its california manufacturing facility 
upon closure  the company moved the related production requirements to its manufacturing facility in mexico and to other independent subcontractors in the far east  costa rica and the united states 
the  loss included property and equipment write downs  employee severance and other exit costs 
no similar closure occurred in other expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease resulted from a  decrease in net interest expense  primarily due to repayments on the company s borrowings under its credit facility in in addition  the company had a net gain on disposal of assets of  in  compared with a loss on disposal of assets aggregating  in income taxes were  for the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of compared with income taxes of  for the year ended december   representing an effective income tax rate of 
the lower effective income tax rate in compared to is due to certain non deductible expenses and losses being a lower proportion to earnings before income taxes in than in such non deductible items include the amortization of goodwill and losses at certain subsidiaries which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes but which are not consolidated for income tax reporting purposes 
the company had net earnings of  for the year ended december  as compared with net earnings of  for the year ended december   an increase of  for the reasons discussed above 
outlook this outlook section  the risk factors section  the last paragraph under liquidity and capital resources  the discussion under seasonality and other statements in this annual report contain a number of forward looking statements including forward looking statements relating to sales and operating expense expectations  the potential imposition of certain customs duties  the potential impact of the teva license expiration  the potential impact of certain litigation  the potential impact of the year on the company and the impact of seasonality on the company s operations 
all of the forward looking statements are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons  including the reasons discussed below and under risk factors 
sales and operating expense expectations 
the company s sales under the teva and ugg product lines increased in compared to the company expects sales for both of these lines to increase in the company experienced a decrease in simple sales in compared to the company expects sales under the simple line to be lower in than in the company s selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of sales in  for a variety of reasons 
the company expects that these costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in the foregoing forward looking statements represent the company s current analysis of trends and information 
actual results could vary as a result of numerous factors 
for example  the company s results are directly dependent on consumer preferences  which are difficult to assess and can shift rapidly 
any shift in consumer preferences away from one or more of the company s product lines could result in lower sales as well as obsolete inventory and the necessity of selling products at significantly reduced selling prices  all of which would adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company is also dependent on its customers continuing to carry and promote its various lines 
the company s sales can be adversely impacted by the ability of the company s suppliers to manufacture and deliver products in time for the company to meet its customers orders 
in addition  sales of each of the company s different lines have historically been higher in different seasons  with the highest percentage of teva sales occurring in the first and second quarter of each year  the highest percentage of simple sales occurring in the third quarter and the highest percentage of ugg sales occurring in the fourth quarter 
consequently  the results for these product lines are highly dependent on results during these specified periods 
in addition  the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the following overall economic and market conditions  competition  demographic changes  the loss of significant customers or suppliers  the performance and reliability of the company s products  customer service  the company s ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights  the company s ability to secure and maintain adequate financing  the company s ability to forecast and subsequently achieve those forecasts  its ability to attract and retain key employees  and the general risks associated with doing international business including foreign exchange risks  duties  quotas and political instability 
sales of the company s products  particularly those under the teva and ugg lines  are very sensitive to weather conditions 
extended periods of unusually cold weather during the spring and summer could adversely impact demand for the company s teva line 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during the fall and winter months could adversely impact demand for the company s ugg product line 
year issue 
the year issue results from computer hardware or software programs written using two digits to identify the year 
these computer programs and hardware were designed and developed without consideration of the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
as a result  such systems may not be able to properly distinguish between years that begin with a and years that begin with a 
if not corrected  such hardware and software programs could create erroneous information by or at the year  causing the company  or its customers or suppliers  to become unable to process normal business transactions accurately or at all 
state of readiness 
the company s year compliance strategy includes several overlapping phases  which the company has defined as follows identification this phase involves the identification of the hardware and software systems used by the company which could be adversely impacted by the year issue 
it includes identification of information technology it systems and non it systems including telecommunications systems and systems associated with facilities such as utilities and security  among others  as well as identification of the impact that year issues may have on the company s key third party relationships including customers  suppliers and financing sources  among others 
analysis this phase involves the determination of the likelihood  impact and magnitude of potential year non compliance for each of the items in the areas previously identified in the identification phase 
conversion this phase involves the development and execution of a plan to bring the previously identified items into year compliance 
testing this phase involves the testing of the various systems to ascertain that the conversion procedures were successful at bringing the systems into compliance 
implementation this phase involves putting the various year compliant systems into use in the company s operations 
the company is continuing to assess the readiness of its various systems for handling the year issue 
the company determined that the version of the software that operated the company s enterprise business systems prior to was not year compliant 
these enterprise business systems include the company s systems for order entry and processing  allocations  inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and financial reporting 
in late  the company received the current version of the underlying software  which the software vendor has stated is year compliant 
the company has completed the conversion phase of its year strategy with respect to its enterprise business systems  and is currently in the testing phase 
the company currently anticipates that it will complete the testing and implementation phases for its enterprise business systems by june  with respect to the company s remaining it systems  including desktops  networks and several departmental hardware and software systems  and its non it systems  the company has recently completed the analysis phase and has begun the conversion phase 
the company currently expects completion of the conversion phase for the majority of the remaining it and non it systems by june  and currently anticipates completion of the testing and implementation phases by september  the company s plan for addressing the readiness of its key external business partners includes requesting information from these partners regarding their own readiness to address their year issues  and an assessment of the potential impact that any non compliance might have on the company s operations 
the company has requested compliance information from key business partners and has begun to receive responses 
the company may add additional business partners to its year program as the company s year readiness plan progresses 
the various phases for this segment are expected to continue throughout estimated costs 
the company currently estimates that total costs related to all phases of the year strategy with respect to its enterprise business systems will aggregate  this estimate is for outside goods and service providers only 
the estimate does not include the time and costs associated with its in house employees  the amount of which is not currently determinable in addition  the estimated costs to bring the remaining it and non it systems into compliance and to address and remedy any non compliance issues at its key business partners are not yet determinable  but will likely exceed  these costs are expected to be funded through operating cash flows and the company s bank facility 
the company does not currently anticipate using any independent verification or validation processes 
the company anticipates that the year compliance efforts will ultimately result in the deferral of other it projects 
however  the deferral of such projects is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the estimated year compliance costs are based on the company s current assessment of its year situation and could change significantly as the year compliance strategy progresses 
as of december   the company had incurred year compliance costs of approximately  risks and contingency plan 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the necessary systems and changes to address the year issues  and the company s inability to implement such systems and changes in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the potential inability of the company s business partners to address their own year issues sufficiently and timely remains a risk which is difficult to assess 
among other things  the company is currently highly dependent on the combination of approximately key suppliers  primarily located in the far east  for the production of its footwear products 
the failure of one or more of these suppliers to adequately address their own year issues could cause them to be unable to manufacture or deliver product to the company on a timely basis  materially adversely impacting the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  the inability of one or more of the company s significant customers to become compliant could adversely impact the customers operations  thus impacting the company s sales and subsequent collections with respect to those customers 
the company s year compliance efforts are subject to many additional risks including the following  among others the company s failure to adequately identify and analyze issues  convert to compliant systems  fully test converted systems  and implement compliant systems  unanticipated issues or delays in any of the phases of the company s strategy  the inability of customers  suppliers and other business partners to become compliant  and the breakdown of local and global infrastructures resulting from the non compliance of utilities  banking systems  transportation  government and communications systems 
as the company has not yet completed various phases of its internal readiness and has not yet determined the readiness of its key business partners  the company cannot yet fully and accurately identify and quantify the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario at this time 
however  the company is currently assessing scenarios and will take steps to mitigate the impact of these scenarios if they were to occur 
this contingency planning has been completed for certain areas while the contingency plans for most areas are still in process 
the company expects to more fully address such contingencies by the end of the second quarter of the company s above assessment of the risks associated with year issues is forward looking 
actual results may vary for a variety of reasons including those described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity consists primarily of cash  trade accounts receivable  inventories and a revolving credit facility 
at december   working capital was  including  of cash 
cash used in operating activities aggregated  for the year ended december  trade accounts receivable increased since december  as a result of the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of compared to  an increase in the amount of receivables with extended payment terms at year end  and the impact of a general decline in the average collection periods 
inventories increased since december  primarily as the company requested its suppliers to deliver its spring teva inventory earlier than it had done in the prior year 
this acceleration of inventory deliveries was intended to increase available inventory to improve the company s ability to fulfill its customers orders on a timely basis and to improve the company s ability to address its spring teva fill in business 
at december   the company had outstanding borrowings of  under its existing credit facility and had outstanding letters of credit aggregating  on january   the company replaced the existing credit facility with a new revolving credit facility the facility with a new lender 
the new facility provides a maximum availability of  subject to a borrowing base of up to of eligible accounts receivables  as defined  and of eligible inventory  as defined 
up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december   or at the company s election at an adjusted eurodollar rate plus 
the facility is secured by substantially all assets of the company 
the agreement underlying the facility includes a tangible net worth covenant  requiring the company to maintain tangible net worth  as defined  of  at december   the actual tangible net worth  as defined  was approximately  the facility expires july  however  in the event that the teva license agreements are extended beyond august  on terms acceptable to the lender  the facility will be extended through the earlier of days preceding the expiration of any new license arrangement or january  under the terms of the facility  if the company terminates the arrangement prior to the expiration date of the facility  the company may be required to pay the lender an early termination fee ranging between and of the facility s commitment amount  depending upon when such termination occurs 
the company has an agreement with a supplier  prosperous dragon  to provide financing for the supplier s operations  of which  was outstanding at december   net of allowance 
the note is secured by all assets of the supplier and bears interest at the prime rate at december  plus 
see business manufacturing 
capital expenditures totaled  for the year ended december  the company s capital expenditures related primarily to a new warehouse management system at the company s ventura county  california distribution center  molds purchased for production  upgrades to corporate computer systems and a new booth for european tradeshows 
the company currently has no material future commitments for capital expenditures 
in december  the company s board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under its existing stock repurchase program from  shares to  shares 
such repurchases are authorized to be made from time to time in open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to price and market conditions as well as the company s cash availability 
under this program  the company repurchased  shares in for cash consideration of   shares in for cash consideration of  and  shares in for cash consideration of  at december    shares remained available for repurchase under the program 
the company is endeavoring to come to an agreement with the teva licensor which would provide the company with the ability to continue to sell the teva products beyond the expiration of the current license terms 
among the possible arrangements  the company may pursue the purchase of the underlying teva rights  a renewal of the existing licenses or a variety of other possibilities 
certain of these possible arrangements may require a significant amount of additional financing 
there are no assurances that the additional financing will be available or that a favorable arrangement with the licensor can be achieved 
the company believes that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under its existing credit facility  and the cash on hand will provide sufficient liquidity to enable it to meet its current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties which could impact the company s ability to maintain its cash position include the company s growth rate  its ability to collect its receivables in a timely manner  the company s ability to effectively manage its inventory  and the volume of letters of credit used to purchase product  among others 
see also the discussion regarding forward looking statements in the preceding outlook section 
seasonality financial results for the outdoor and footwear industries are generally seasonal 
sales of each of the company s different product lines have historically been higher in different seasons  with the highest percentage of teva sales occurring in the first and second quarter of each year  the highest percentage of simple sales occurring in the third quarter and the highest percentage of ugg sales occurring in the fourth quarter 
based on the company s historical experience  the company would expect greater sales in the first and second quarters than in the third and fourth quarters 
the actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition  and the company s customers continuing to carry and promote it s various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties
