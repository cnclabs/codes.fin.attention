overview doubleclick is a leading provider of comprehensive internet advertising solutions for advertisers and web publishers worldwide 
doubleclick currently has two principal service offerings 
the doubleclick network ad sales provides fully outsourced ad sales  delivery and related services to publishers of highly trafficked web sites  including altavista  the dilbert zone  macromedia and us news online 
the doubleclick network focuses on meeting the needs of internet advertisers who target users on a national  international and or local basis 
doubleclick s dart service ad serving  consisting of dart for web publishers and the recently introduced closed loop marketing solutions suite of products for advertisers and ad agencies  provides web publishers  advertisers and ad agencies with the ability to control the targeting  delivery  measurement and analysis of their online marketing campaigns on a real time basis 
the doubleclick network and dart service lines of business are available to web publishers and advertisers in international markets 
doubleclick s proprietary dart technology  which dynamically matches and delivers ads to the target audience within milliseconds  is the platform for all of doubleclick s solutions 
doubleclick completed its initial public offering on february  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  on december   doubleclick received net proceeds of approximately million from its additional public offering 
the net proceeds of these two public offerings were added to doubleclick s working capital and  pending their use  doubleclick has invested such funds in short term  interest bearing investment grade obligations 
doubleclick was founded in january by kevin j 
o connor  doubleclick s chief executive officer  dwight a 
merriman  doubleclick s chief technical officer  and poppe tyson  inc doubleclick has grown from employees as of march  to employees as of december  from january  inception through may  doubleclick s operating activities related primarily to developing the dart technology and the doubleclick network  and recruiting personnel 
during the same period  substantially all of doubleclick s revenues resulted from internet advertising sales on a commission basis on behalf of the netscape and excite web sites 
for the period from january  inception through december   such commissions constituted of doubleclick s revenues 
all ads sold on behalf of the netscape and excite web sites were delivered directly by such entities  as their web sites were not on the doubleclick network 
since the fourth quarter of  doubleclick has derived substantially all of its revenues from the doubleclick network 
doubleclick offers advertising on the doubleclick network to third party advertisers with pricing generally determined on a cpm cost per thousand ads delivered or cost per day basis 
discounts are offered based on a variety of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors  including the duration and gross dollar amount of advertising campaigns 
advertisements delivered by doubleclick are typically sold pursuant to purchase order agreements  which are subject to cancellation 
doubleclick s revenues from the doubleclick network are received from the advertiser that orders the ad  and doubleclick typically pays the web publisher on whose web site such advertisement is delivered a service fee 
this service fee is calculated as a percentage of such advertising revenues  which amount is included in cost of revenues 
doubleclick is responsible for billing and collecting for ads delivered on the doubleclick network  and typically assumes the risk of non payment from advertisers 
in addition  doubleclick earns service fees for providing the dart service to web publishers and the closed loop marketing solutions suite of products to internet advertisers and ad agencies 
to date  revenues from doubleclick s dart service have not been significant 
advertising revenues are recognized in the period that the advertisement is delivered  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
doubleclick also sells sponsorship advertising  which involves a greater degree of integration among doubleclick  the advertiser and the web sites on the doubleclick network 
these sponsorships are typically priced based on the length of time that the sponsorship runs  rather than a cpm basis 
revenues relating to sponsorship advertising are recognized ratably over the sponsorship period 
as part of the doubleclick network  doubleclick also offers doubleclick direct  an internet advertising solution for direct marketers 
doubleclick direct advertising is priced on a cost per click  cost per lead and cost per sale or download basis  rather than a cpm basis 
doubleclick expects the doubleclick network will continue to account for a substantial portion of doubleclick s revenues for the foreseeable future 
moreover  ads delivered on the web sites of the top four web publishers on the doubleclick network  including altavista  accounted for approximately of doubleclick s revenues  and of doubleclick s revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
of the for the year ended december   approximately of doubleclick s revenues related to altavista and an aggregate of approximately of doubleclick s revenues related to the web sites of the next three top doubleclick publishers on the doubleclick network 
other than the altavista web site  no other web site or doubleclick publisher accounted for more than of doubleclick s revenue in doubleclick typically enters into short term contracts with doubleclick publishers for inclusion of their web sites in the doubleclick network 
the failure to successfully market the doubleclick network  the loss of one or more of the web sites which account for a significant portion of doubleclick s revenues from the doubleclick network  or any significant reduction in traffic on such web sites could have a material adverse effect on doubleclick s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to take advantage of the global reach of the internet  doubleclick has established doubleclick networks in europe  asia and other international markets 
doubleclick currently has operations in australia  canada  france  germany  united kingdom  and benelux belgium  netherlands  and luxembourg and through its business partners  in japan  iberoamerica  italy and scandinavia 
doubleclick expects to continue to invest in building its international operations 
in december  doubleclick entered into a procurement and trafficking agreement with digital equipment corporation acquired by compaq in june pursuant to which double click had the exclusive right to sell and deliver all advertising on specified pages within the altavista web site 
in accordance with this agreement  doubleclick paid altavista a service fee calculated as a percentage of the revenues derived from delivery of advertisements on or through the altavista web site 
effective january   doubleclick changed its relationship with compaq by entering into an advertising services agreement that superceded the procurement and trafficking agreement 
pursuant to the advertising services agreement  compaq has agreed to use doubleclick s dart technology for ad delivery and to outsource to doubleclick certain ad sales functions for domestic  international  and local ad sales 
in consideration for such services performed by doubleclick  compaq will pay to doubleclick i a dart services fee for all domestic  international and local advertising delivered by doubleclick to the altavista web site  ii a sales commission based on the net revenues management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued generated from all advertisements sold by doubleclick on behalf of compaq and iii a billing and collections fee for all billing and collections services performed by doubleclick on behalf of compaq 
under the new agreement  the manner in which doubleclick reports its financial results related to the services it provides altavista has changed 
through december   doubleclick recognized as revenues the gross amount of billings related to ads delivered by double click to the altavista web site 
beginning january   doubleclick will recognize as revenues the dart service fee  the sales commission and billing and collection fees 
as a result of the change in relationship with altavista  we expect our overall gross margin to increase as we are no longer required to pay service fees to altavista for ads delivered on the altavista web site 
the advertising services agreement will expire on december   subject to prior termination in certain limited circumstances or further extension in accordance with the terms of the advertising services agreement 
doubleclick has incurred significant losses since its inception  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of million  of which million related to cumulative losses and million related to the redemption of shares of common stock from certain stockholders in connection with doubleclick s recapitalization that occurred simultaneously with the completion of a private placement of doubleclick s securities in june in addition  during the year ended december   doubleclick recorded deferred compensation of million  which represents the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain stock options granted to employees 
the deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the related options 
of the total deferred compensation amount  approximately million had been amortized as of december  doubleclick believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
doubleclick plans to significantly increase its operating expenses to increase its sales and marketing operations  to continue its international expansion  to upgrade and enhance its dart technology and to market and support its solutions 
doubleclick may be unable to modify its planned spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if doubleclick has a shortfall in revenues in relation to its expenses  or if doubleclick s expenses precede increased revenues  then doubleclick s results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that doubleclick will not incur significant losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth the consolidated results of operations of doubleclick expressed as a percentage of revenues period from january  inception year ended december  through december  consolidated statement of operations data revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative product development total operating expenses loss from operations net interest income expense net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues doubleclick s revenues are derived primarily from the delivery of advertisements on the web sites of web publishers on the doubleclick network

revenues earned from advertisements delivered on or through the altavista web site were million  or of revenues for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenues for the year ended december  approximately million of revenues for the year ended december  resulted from sales of inventory on the altavista web site which was derived from an arrangement between altavista and another search engine that expired on june   and was therefore non recurring 
altavista is a significant part of the doubleclick network 
no other web site accounted for more than of revenues for the year ended december   and no one advertiser accounted for more than of revenues during the same period 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of service fees paid to web publishers for ads delivered to the web sites on the doubleclick network 
cost of revenues also includes other costs of delivering advertisements  including depreciation of the ad delivery system and internet access costs 
gross margin was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross margin increased for the year ended december  compared to december  due to an increase in revenues from its higher margin dart services as a percentage of total revenues in  which was offset  in part  by a decrease in doubleclick s sales of advertisements on a commission basis as a percentage of doubleclick s total revenue

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  advertising  maintenance of doubleclick s web site  trade show expenses  seminars and costs of marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  or and of revenues  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to the increase in sales personnel  commissions associated with the increase in revenues  costs associated with expanding international operations  and costs related to the continued development and implementation of doubleclick s marketing and branding campaigns 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues resulted from such expenses increasing more rapidly than revenues as doubleclick continued to build its sales and marketing infrastructure

loss from operations doubleclick s loss from operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the loss from operations was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel  particularly in sales and marketing  and product development

however  doubleclick expects that the loss from operations may decrease both on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenues in the future 
interest income expense net interest income was million for the year ended december  interest income was attributable to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of the net proceeds received by doubleclick from its public offerings of common stock in interest income in future periods may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in average cash balances maintained by doubleclick and changes in the market rate of its investments

altavista is a significant part of the doubleclick network

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost of revenues gross margin was and for the year ended december  and for the period from january  inception through december  respectively

doubleclick currently anticipates that it will continue to experience significant growth in its operating expenses for the foreseeable future and that its operating expenses will be a material use of doubleclick s cash resources 
doubleclick believes that the net proceeds of the offerings  together with its existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance overview currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and governmental agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
state of readiness 
doubleclick has generally completed its initial assessment of the year readiness of its information technology it systems  including the hardware and software that enable doubleclick to provide and deliver its solutions  and its non it systems 
doubleclick s assessment plan consists of i quality assurance testing of its internally developed proprietary software incorporated in its solutions solutions software  ii contacting third party vendors and licensors of material hardware  software and services that are both directly and indirectly related to the delivery of doubleclick s solutions to its web publisher and advertiser customers  iii contacting vendors of material non it systems  iv assessment of repair or replacement requirements  v repair or replacement  vi implementation  and vii creation of contingency plans in the event of year failures 
doubleclick is conducting quality assurance testing to ensure year compliance of all new internally developed proprietary code incorporated into its solutions software 
doubleclick plans to perform a year simulation on its solutions software during the second quarter of  following the implementation of revisions to the solutions software planned for the first quarter of based on the results of its year simulation test  doubleclick intends to revise the code of its solutions software as necessary to improve the year compliance of its solutions software 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued doubleclick has been informed by many of its vendors of material hardware and software components of its it systems that the products used by doubleclick are currently year compliant 
doubleclick is in the process of requiring vendors of the other material hardware and software components in its it systems to provide assurances of their year compliance 
doubleclick plans to complete this process during the first half of doubleclick has completed an assessment of the materiality of its non it systems and is in the process of seeking assurances of year compliance from providers of its material non it systems 
in addition  doubleclick  like all businesses  is dependent on the continued functioning  domestically and internationally  of basic services such as electrical utilities  telephony  mail delivery  and transportation in order to conduct its business 
while doubleclick is taking steps to attempt to ensure that the third parties on which it is reliant are year compliant  it cannot predict the likelihood of such compliance nor the direct or indirect costs to the doubleclick of non compliance by those third parties or of securing alternate services from year compliant parties 
pending completion of its planned year simulation test of its solutions software and its program of requesting year assurances from vendors and licensors of material it and non it systems  doubleclick has not yet completed its year compliance repair or replacement analysis  or of its contingency plans 
doubleclick plans to complete all year planning and analysis before the end of the fourth quarter 
costs 
to date  doubleclick has not incurred any material expenditures in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
most of its expenses have related to  and are expected to include  the operating costs associated with time spent by employees in the evaluation process and year compliance matters generally 
at this time  doubleclick does not possess the information necessary to estimate the potential costs of revisions to its solutions software should such revisions be required or the replacement of third party software  hardware or services that are determined not to be year compliant 
although doubleclick does not anticipate that such expenses will be material  such expenses  if higher than anticipated  could have a material adverse effect on doubleclick s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks 
doubleclick believes that it has established an effective program to resolve material year issues in its sole control in a timely manner 
as noted above  however  doubleclick has not yet completed all phases of its program and is dependent on third parties whose progress is not within its control 
the failure by such third parties to be year compliant could result in a systematic failure beyond the control of doubleclick from delivering its services to its customers  decrease the use of the internet or prevent users from accessing the web sites of its web publishers customers  which could have material adverse effect on doubleclick s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that doubleclick will not discover year compliance problems in our solutions software that will require substantial revisions which could be costly and time consuming to remedy 
in the event that doubleclick does not complete any of its currently planned additional remediation prior to the year  doubleclick could experience significant difficulty in producing and delivering solutions and conducting its business in the year as it has in the past  which could result in lost revenues  increased operating costs  the loss of customers and other business interruptions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on doubleclick s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the failure to adequately address year compliance issues could result in claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation or breach of contract and related litigation  which could be costly and time consuming to defend 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
contingency plan 
as discussed above  doubleclick is engaged in an ongoing year assessment and has not yet developed any contingency plans 
the results of doubleclick s year simulation testing and the responses received from third party vendors and service providers will be taken into account in determining the nature and extent of any contingency plans

therefore  volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on those revenues and assets denominated in non us currencies 
interest rate risk doubleclick s investments are classified as available for sale securities therefore changes in the market s interest rates effect the value of the investment as recorded by doubleclick and are recorded as unrealized gains and losses on the financial statements

limited operating history we were incorporated in january and have a limited operating history 
an investor in our common stock must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  including the internet advertising market

history of losses and anticipation of continued losses we incurred net losses of million for the period from january  inception through december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur operating losses at least into the year we expect to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and  as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
although our revenues have grown in recent quarters  we cannot assure you that we will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
even if we do achieve profitability  we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if revenues grow slower than we anticipate  or if operating expenses exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected

typically we enter into short term contracts with web publishers for inclusion of their web sites in the doubleclick network 
since these contracts are short term  we will have to negotiate new contracts or renewals in the future which may have terms that are not as favorable to us as the terms of the existing contracts

we expect that the doubleclick network will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
the doubleclick network consists of web sites of a limited number of web publishers with which we have short term contracts 
we cannot assure you that such web publishers will remain associated with the doubleclick network  that any doubleclick network web site will maintain consistent or increasing levels of traffic over time  or that we will be able to timely or effectively replace any exiting doubleclick network web site with other web sites with comparable traffic patterns and user demographics 
our failure to successfully market the doubleclick network  the loss of one or more of the web publishers which account for a significant portion of our revenues from the doubleclick network  or the failure of the web sites on the doubleclick network to maintain consistent or increasing levels of traffic would materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for detailed information on our reliance on the doubleclick network 
quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
these factors include advertiser and web publisher demand for our solutions  user traffic levels and the number of available impressions on the doubleclick network s web sites  seasonal fluctuations in internet usage  changes in service fees we pay to web publishers  changes in the growth rate of internet usage  the commitment of advertising budgets to internet advertising  the mix of revenues from our various internet advertising solutions  the timing and amount of costs relating to the expansion of our operations  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the introduction of new solutions by us or our competitors  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and general economic and market conditions 
our revenues for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on the doubleclick network 
such future revenues are difficult to forecast 
in addition  we plan to significantly increase our operating expenses to increase our sales and marketing operations  to continue our international expansion  to upgrade and enhance our dart technology  and to market and support our solutions 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or if our expenses precede increased revenues  then our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
such a result would likely affect the market price of our common stock in a manner which may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we believe that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first calendar quarter of each year 
if our market makes the transition from an emerging to a more developed medium  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop in our industry 
our revenues may also be affected by seasonal and cyclical patterns in internet advertising spending if they emerge 
due to all of the foregoing factors and the other risks discussed in this section  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business sales and marketing for detailed information on our quarterly operating results 
need to manage growth to successfully implement our business plan in the rapidly evolving market for internet advertising requires an effective planning and management process 
we continue to increase the scope of our operations both domestically and internationally  and we have grown our workforce substantially 
as of march   we had a total of employees and  as of december   we had a total of employees 
in addition  we plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing and customer support organizations both domestically and internationally 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth in our operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our workforce 
our future performance may also depend on the effective integration of acquired businesses 
such integration  even if successful  may take a significant period of time and expense  and may place a significant strain on our resources 
our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations or the relocation of our data operations 
recent development of the internet advertising market and unproven acceptance and effectiveness of web advertising our future success is highly dependent on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium 
the internet advertising market is new and rapidly evolving  and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its effectiveness 
as a result  demand and market acceptance for internet advertising solutions is uncertain 
most of our current or potential advertising customers have little or no experience using the internet for advertising purposes and they have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising products and services 
such customers may find internet advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional advertising media 
in addition  most of our current and potential web publisher customers have little or no experience in generating revenues from the sale of advertising space on their web sites 
we cannot assure you that the market for internet advertising will continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or develops more slowly than we expect  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
there are currently no standards for the measurement of the effectiveness of internet advertising and standard measurements may need to be developed to support and promote internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
our advertising customers may challenge or refuse to accept our or third party measurements of advertisement delivery results  and our customers may not accept any errors in such measurements 
in addition  the accuracy of database information used to target advertisements is essential to the effectiveness of internet advertising that may be developed in the future 
the information in our database  like any database  may contain inaccuracies which our customers may not accept 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the delivery of banner advertisements 
if advertisers determine that banner advertising is an ineffective or unattractive advertising medium  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively make the transition to any other form of internet advertising 
also  there are filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a user s computer 
the commercial viability of internet advertising  and our business  results of operations and financial condition  would be materially and adversely affected by web users widespread adoption of such software 
privacy concerns web sites usually place certain information cookies on a user s hard drive usually without the user s knowledge or consent 
web sites use cookies for a variety of reasons 
our dart technology uses cookies to limit the frequency with which the user is shown a particular ad 
certain currently available internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to remove cookies at any time or to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive 
in addition  some internet commentators  privacy advocates and governmental bodies have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies 
the effectiveness of our dart technology could be limited by any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies 
the european union has recently adopted a directive addressing data privacy that may result in limitations on the collection and use of certain information regarding internet users 
these limitations may limit our ability to target advertising or collect and use information in certain european countries 
since implementing regulations have not been adopted at this time  we cannot yet determine the full impact of the directive on us 
unproven business model our business model is to generate revenues solely by providing internet advertising solutions to advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
the profit potential for our business model is unproven 
to be successful  both internet advertising and our solutions will need to achieve broad market acceptance by advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
our ability to generate significant revenues from advertisers will depend  in part  on our ability to contract with web publishers that have web sites with adequate available ad space inventory 
further  these web sites must generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to our advertisers 
the intense competition among internet advertising sellers has led to the creation of a number of pricing alternatives for internet advertising 
these alternatives make it difficult for us to project future levels of advertising revenues and applicable gross margin that can be sustained by us or the internet advertising industry in general 
market acceptance of our new solutions  including doubleclick local and the closed loop marketing solutions suite of products  will depend on the continued emergence of internet commerce  communication and advertising  and market demand for our solutions 
we cannot assure you that the market for our new solutions will develop or that demand for our new solutions will emerge or become sustainable 
year risks currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems and software products will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and governmental agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
we have generally completed our preliminary assessment of our year readiness 
we plan to perform a year simulation on our software during the second quarter of  following the implementation of revisions to our software contemplated in the first quarter of we are also in the process of contacting certain third party vendors  licensors and providers of software  hardware and services regarding their year readiness 
following this testing and after contacting these vendors and licensors  we will be better able to make a complete evaluation of our year readiness  to determine what costs will be necessary to be year compliant  and to determine whether contingency plans need to be developed 
please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year compliance for detailed information on our state of readiness  potential risks and contingency plans regarding the year issue 
risk of system failure the dart technology resides on a computer system located in our new york city offices and in doubleclick data centers in new jersey  california  australia  brazil  england  france  germany  netherlands and sweden 
this system s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success 
customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them  including failures affecting our ability to deliver advertisements without significant delay to the viewer 
sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers  ad agencies and web publishers 
slower response time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our deployed software or hardware due to an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers 
to the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against damage from fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failures  vandalism and other malicious acts  and similar unexpected adverse events 
in addition  interruptions in our solutions could result from the failure of our telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame we require 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions in the delivery of our solutions 
doubleclick s ad serving capabilities  operational information and data storage are presently redundant  as well as archived 
we expect all of our back end systems for disaster recovery to be fully redundant by the second quarter of our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations 
our markets are highly competitive our markets  namely internet advertising and related products and services  are intensely competitive 
we expect such competition to continue to increase because our markets pose no substantial barriers to entry 
competition may also increase as a result of industry consolidation 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control  including the following the timing and market acceptance of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions developed either by us or our competitors  customer service and support efforts  sales and marketing efforts  and the ease of use  performance  price and reliability of solutions developed either by doubleclick or its competitors 
we compete for internet advertising revenues with large web publishers and web search engine companies  such as america online  excite  lycos  microsoft  infoseek and yahoo 
further  our doubleclick network competes with a variety of internet advertising networks  including media 
in marketing our doubleclick network and dart service to web publishers  we also compete with providers of ad servers and related services  including netgravity and adforce 
we also encounter competition from a number of other sources  including content aggregation companies  companies engaged in advertising sales networks  advertising agencies  and other companies which facilitate internet advertising 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these factors may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees  strategic partners  advertisers and web publishers 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop products or services that are equal or superior to our solutions or that achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective advertising  ad agency and web publisher customers 
as a result  it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
companies doing business on the internet  including ours  must also compete with television  radio  cable and print traditional advertising media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
advertisers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising if they perceive the internet to be a limited or ineffective advertising medium 
risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
from time to time we have had discussions with companies regarding our acquiring  or investing in  their businesses  products  services or technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates 
even if we do identify suitable candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired products  services or technologies into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations due to accounting requirements such as goodwill 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
dependence on key personnel our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  in particular  kevin j 
o connor  our chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  kevin p 
ryan  our president and chief operating officer  and dwight a 
merriman  our chief technical officer 
we have no employment agreements with any of these executives 
the loss of the services of messrs 
o connor  ryan or merriman  or certain other key employees  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success also depends on our continuing to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in our industry is intense 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
dependence on the web infrastructure our success will depend  in large part  upon the maintenance of the web infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and timely development of enabling products such as high speed modems  for providing reliable web access and services and improved content 
we cannot assure you that the web infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the web continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may have to spend considerable amounts to adapt our solutions accordingly 
furthermore  the web has experienced a variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its infrastructure 
such outages and delays could impact the web sites of web publishers using our solutions and the level of user traffic on web sites on the doubleclick network 
dependence on proprietary rights and risk of infringement our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have filed three patent applications in the united states and one patent application internationally 
in addition  we apply to register our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
we own the registration for the doubleclick trademark in the united states 
we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications or trademark applications will be approved 
even if they are approved  such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks  our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our dart technology collects and utilizes data derived from user activity on the doubleclick network and the web sites of web publishers using our solutions 
this data is used for ad targeting and predicting ad performance 
although we believe that we have the right to use such data and the compilation of such data in our database  we cannot assure you that any trade secret  copyright or other protection will be available for such information 
in addition  others may claim rights to such information 
further  pursuant to our contracts with web publishers using our solutions  we are obligated to keep certain information regarding each web publisher confidential 
we have licensed  and we may license in the future  elements of our trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these business partners  such partners may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
we cannot assure you that any of our proprietary rights will be viable or of value in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
furthermore  third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
from time to time we have been  and we expect to continue to be  subject to claims in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or the web publishers with web sites in the doubleclick network 
such claims and any resultant litigation  should it occur  could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
risks associated with technological change the internet and internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions  and changing customer demands 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
risks associated with international expansion we have operations in a number of international markets 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing efforts 
to date  we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our solutions and in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
we have established doubleclick networks in australia  canada  france  germany  benelux belgium  netherlands  and luxembourg and the united kingdom 
in japan  iberoamerica spain  portugal and latin america  italy and scandinavia sweden  norway  finland  and denmark  we are relying on our business partners to conduct operations  establish local networks  aggregate web publishers and coordinate sales and marketing efforts 
our success in such markets is directly dependent on the success of our business partners and their dedication of sufficient resources to our relationship 
international operations are subject to other inherent risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal fluctuations in internet usage 
these risks may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
government regulation and legal uncertainties laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent 
the most recent session of the united states congress resulted in internet laws regarding children s privacy  copyrights and taxation 
such legislation could dampen the growth in use of the web generally and decrease the acceptance of the web as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
the governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the european union recently enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain user information 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
substantial influence by officers and directors the executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own approximately a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders may be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of doubleclick 
possible volatility of stock price the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the offering price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
new accounting pronouncements doubleclick continually assesses the effects of recently issued accounting standards 
the impact of all recently adopted and issued accounting standards have been disclosed in the consolidated financial statements
