in december  the company named vitronics and its chairman and ceo  james manfield  in a lawsuit  filed in superior court of the state of new hampshire  citing malicious prosecution and abuse of process 
the suit claims that vitronics  when it initiated the patent infringement case against conceptronic  knew or should have known that the suit was without merit  and that claim of us patent  was invalid  unenforceable  and as a consequence  the patent was not infringed

derivative financial instruments the company has entered into fixed interest rate exchange agreements interest rate swaps which it uses to manage interest rate risk arising from the company s debt 
interest rate swaps are accounted for as hedges  and  accordingly  amounts receivable or payable under interest rate swaps are recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
gains and losses on early terminations of interest rate swaps are included in the carrying amount of the related debt  and amortized as yield adjustments over the remaining term of the derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use such instruments for trading purposes 
in order to hedge its variable term loan interest rate risk  the company has entered into various interest rate swaps pursuant to which it pays fixed interest rates on  at approximately  and receives variable interest rates on the same notional amount 
during the year ended december   the company s payments under interest rate swaps were  the company had receipts of  pursuant to interest rate swaps 
the company s interest rate swaps expire as follows interest rate swaps expiration date interest rate notional amount market value september    november    december    december    december    december    december    other parties to the agreements expose the company to credit losses for the periodic settlements of amounts due under the interest rate swaps in the event of non performance 
however  the company does not anticipate that it will incur any material credit losses because it does not anticipate non performance by the counter parties 
seasonality the company s telecom construction operations are expected to have seasonally weaker results in the first and fourth quarters of the year  and may produce stronger results in the second and third quarters 
this seasonality is primarily due to the effect of winter weather on outside plant activities in the northern areas served by acg  as well as reduced daylight hours and customer budgetary constraints 
certain customers tend to complete budgeted capital expenditures before the end of the year  and postpone additional expenditures until the subsequent fiscal period 
year date conversion the year issue relates to the inability of certain computer software programs to properly recognize and process date sensitive information relative to the year and beyond 
without corrective measures  this issue could cause computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue by the company or by its key vendors  customers suppliers or by other third parties could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition in the future 
conceptronic evaluated its year compliance issues during the year ended december  conceptronic has undertaken the remediation of most of its year exposures and expects to complete remediation efforts during the second quarter of during  acg commenced the upgrading of its business information systems through common integrated computer and software systems throughout acg 
as a by product of the implementation of the new integrated business reporting system  acg expects to remediate year compliance issues at certain of its divisions which were not already year compliant 
all acg divisions are expected to be operating on the new integrated business system during the second quarter of with most acg divisions completed during the first quarter of in conjunction with its review of its year compliance issues  the company has conducted an inventory of its information technology it and manufacturing and telecom construction systems non it  as well as its telecommunications systems 
acg has addressed its year compliance issue for it  non it and telecommunications systems 
conceptronic expects to complete steps necessary to remediate significant year compliance issues by the second quarter of the total cost with respect to systems and other modifications to company it  non it and telecommunications systems is not expected to exceed  more than one half of which was expended in the company has also identified and prioritized critical suppliers and customers and communicated with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
detailed evaluations of the most critical third parties have been completed 
contingency plans are being developed in the first quarter of in response to the detailed evaluations 
based upon currently available information  the company expects that all phases of its year project will be completed by the end of the second quarter of with the completed and planned year modifications to its it systems and non it systems and telecommunications systems  the company currently believes that the year issue should not pose significant operational problems to the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that the systems of other parties upon which the company s business relies  including  but not limited to  the company s key vendors  customers  suppliers and other third parties will be converted on a timely basis 
if the systems and applications of key third parties are materially impacted by the year issue  the company could lose certain of its abilities to efficiently engage in normal business activities which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
although some business disruption in the company s business may possibly occur as a result of year failures by third parties  the company is not able at this time to ascertain the extent of any such disruption 
contingency plans are being developed in the first quarter of in response to the company s evaluation of year business exposures 
arguss believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and contingency planning with respect to key vendors and customers  as well as the expansion of its bank credit facilities  the possibility of significant business interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario which could occur with respect to year is a delay in receiving payments on accounts receivable from customers 
arguss is negotiating the expansion of its liquidity through expanded bank financing facilities 
the company believes that such expanded financing should mitigate delays in collections of amounts due from customers 
in addition to its internal systems and external supplier and customer relationships  arguss has exposure to year compliance issues with respect to potential acquisitions 
the company includes year compliance in its evaluation of acquisition candidates  as well as in its due diligence in progress 
at december   the company had no acquisition in progress 
non compliance with year could have an adverse impact on valuations of potential acquisitions or reduce arguss program of making acquisitions 
impact of inflation the primary inflationary factor affecting the company s operation is increased labor costs 
the company s revenue is principally derived from services performed under master contracts  which typically include provisions to increase contract prices on an annual basis based on increases in the construction price index 
accordingly  the company believes that increases in labor costs will not have a significant impact on its results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  arguss is exposed to interest rate risk 
to reduce variable term loan interest rate risk  the company has entered into interest rate swaps in the same notional amount as its related term loan debt with the same interest rate relationship base to libor as that of arguss floating rate debt and for the same term as the variable rate debt 
at december   arguss variable rate term loans aggregating  in notional amount and maturing in more than days was hedged through interest rate swaps pursuant to which arguss pays a weighted fixed interest rate of 
interest rate swaps are entered into as a hedge of underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value  but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would decrease the fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately  the earnings and cash flow impact for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be neutral because of the cash flow received from the swaps 
all of the principal of the variable rate debt subject to interest rate swaps would be repayed over the next five years thereby diminishing the impact of market valuations on hedges
