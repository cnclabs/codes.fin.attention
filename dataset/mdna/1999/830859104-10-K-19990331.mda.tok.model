the company used million for payment of debt obligations in working capital and negative profitability trends the company plans to spend substantial additional resources in in connection with its electronic commerce and other growth initiatives 
the company anticipates that such expenditures will approximate million  including approximately million in capital expenditures  and plans to spend such funds on a number of activities  including improving the company s web user interface  improving the speed  stability and functionality of the company s web site  implementing marketing and public relations initiatives to raise awareness of the skymall brand name  securing additional content for the company s web site  improving the selection and variety of products offered by the company  and recruiting and hiring additional personnel  particularly technology managers and developers 
although the company has been profitable in recent years  the company expects that the significant investment spending it plans to undertake in will cause it to incur losses in in the range of approximately to per share 
at december   the company had net working capital of million  which included cash and cash equivalents of million 
additionally  the company maintains a reducing revolving line of credit at a bank with a maximum available line of million 
as of march   the entire balance of the revolving line of credit was unused 
existing working capital is insufficient to permit the company to fully implement its business plan and growth strategy 
management plans to finance its working capital needs and capital expenditures through a combination of funds from operations  the existing bank line of credit  and by securing additional capital resources through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure additional capital to meet its working capital needs or to secure such capital on terms favorable to the company 
a failure to secure such capital may be detrimental to the company and cause it to reduce or eliminate its growth initiatives

changes in securities and use of proceeds the company conducted its initial public offering the offering in december  pursuant to a form s registration statement file no 
 declared effective on december  the company sold  shares of common stock to the public at a price of per share  or million in the aggregate 
the company s actual expenses incurred in connection with the offering were approximately million in the aggregate  resulting in approximately million in net proceeds to the company 
for the period from december  through december   the company used the net proceeds as follows approximately i million for building improvements to the corporate offices and the customer contact center  ii million for the purchase and installation of telephone and computer software and equipment  iii million for the reduction of the company s revolving line of credit  iv  for marketing and promotional expenses  v million for development of additional circulation media  vi million for the repurchase of  of the company s common shares  and vii million for the acquisition of durham company in october none of the above mentioned amounts consist of direct or indirect payments to affiliates 
the preceding discussion of the company s use of net proceeds is based upon reasonable estimates by management 
except for capital expenditures  the reduction of the line of credit  the repurchase of the company s common shares and the acquisition of durham company discussed in items i  ii  iii  vi and vii above  the company s use of proceeds  as described herein  does not represent a material change from that described in the prospectus for the offering

fluctuation in quarterly results the company s operating results may fluctuate from period to period as a result of the seasonal nature of the retail industry

additional factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following important factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors currently have a significant impact or may have a significant impact on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be profitable in the future 
although we have been profitable in recent years  we plan to significantly increase spending on our growth initiatives from historical levels and we expect to incur losses in the foreseeable future 
we estimate that we will incur losses of approximately per share in in addition  although we plan to spend significant additional resources in connection with the execution of our growth strategy  including for marketing  technological development and personnel costs  there can be no assurance that we can successfully deploy such resources to accomplish the objectives of our growth strategies and increase the revenues of the company 
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital 
our current working capital  along with our existing line of credit  is not sufficient to permit the company to fully implement its business plan 
in order to fully implement our growth strategy  we will need to raise additional capital from third parties or otherwise secure additional financing for the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully raise additional capital or secure other financing  or that such funding will be available on terms that are favorable to the company 
to the extent we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital or secure other financing  we may be unable to fully implement our planned growth strategy 
our business may not grow in the future 
since our inception  we have rapidly expanded our operations  growing from total revenues of  in to total revenues of million in our continued future growth will depend to a significant degree on our ability to increase revenues from our existing businesses  maintain existing channel partner relationships and develop new channel partner relationships  expand our product and content offering to consumers  while maintaining adequate gross margins  and implement other programs that increase the circulation of the skymall print catalogs and generate traffic for our e commerce programs 
our ability to implement our growth strategy will also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are or may be beyond our control  including i our ability to select products that appeal to our customer base and effectively market them to our target audience  ii sustained or increased levels of airline travel  particularly in domestic airline markets  iii increasing adoption by consumers of the internet for shopping  iv the continued perception by participating merchants that we offer an effective marketing channel for their products and services  and v our ability to attract  train and retain qualified employees and management 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy 
our future growth is in part dependent upon the continued growth of the electronic commerce market 
the market for the sale of products and services over the internet is a new and rapidly evolving market 
our future growth strategy is partially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of on line services as an avenue for retail purchases 
consumers have only recently begun to make purchases over the internet and there is no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future 
in order for us to grow our on line customer base  we will need to attract purchasers who have historically relied upon traditional venues for making their retail purchases 
if use of on line services does not continue to grow as expected  or if the technological infrastructure for the internet is unable to effectively support its growing use  our growth strategy may be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to manage the potential growth of our business 
our potential growth may place significant demands upon our personnel  management and financial resources 
in order to manage this growth  we may have to hire additional personnel and develop additional management infrastructure 
there is no assurance that people with the necessary skills and experience will be available as needed or on terms favorable to us 
there is no assurance that our current and planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations  that we will be able to attract  hire  train  retain  motivate and manage necessary personnel  or that our management will be able to identify  manage and exploit existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities 
if we are unable to effectively manage any potential growth  our business and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our plans for international expansion pose additional risks 
a significant aspect of our growth strategy is to expand our business internationally  through our in flight catalog program as well as the internet 
we have limited experience in selling our products and services internationally 
such expansion will place additional burdens upon our management  personnel and financial resources and may cause the company to incur losses 
we will also face different and additional competition in these international markets 
in addition  international expansion has certain unique risks  such as regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding liability  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  political instability and potentially adverse tax implications 
to the extent we expand our business internationally  we will also become subject to risks associated with international monetary exchange fluctuations 
any one of these risks could impair our ability to expand internationally as well as have a material adverse impact upon our overall business operations  growth and financial condition 
we face intense competition 
the distribution channels for our products are highly competitive 
from time to time in our airline catalog business  competitors  typically other catalog retailers  have attempted to secure contracts with various airlines to offer merchandise to their customers 
american airlines currently offers merchandise catalogs to their customers through a competitor 
various international airlines also offer merchandise catalogs to their passengers through our competitors 
we also face competition for customers from airport based retailers  duty free retailers  specialty stores  department stores and specialty and general merchandise catalogs  many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we compete for customers with other in flight marketing media  such as airline sponsored in flight magazines and airline video programming 
in our electronic commerce sales  we face intense competition from other content providers and retailers who seek to offer their products and or services at their own web sites or those of other third parties 
the success of on line marketing cannot be currently determined  and further penetration in this market will require substantial additional financial resources  acquisition of technology  investments in marketing and contractual relationships with third parties 
results will also be affected by existing competition  which the company anticipates will intensify  and by additional entrants to the market who may already have the necessary technology and expertise  many of whom may have substantially greater resources than the company 
dependence on channel relationships 
our business depends significantly on our relationships with the airlines  affiliate web sites  hotels and other channel partners 
our agreements with our channel partners are typically short term allowing the partner to terminate the relationship on to days advance notice 
there is no assurance that our channel partners will continue their relationships with us and the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to maintain historical margin levels 
although our gross margin levels on sales of our products have increased in recent years  we may be unable to further increase or maintain our gross margins at historical levels  particularly for our electronic commerce initiatives 
as competition in on line shopping intensifies  our merchant participants may be unable or unwilling to participate in our programs when more favorable economic arrangements may be available from other third parties 
although many of our merchants have participated with us for several years  most of our relationships are short term and may be re negotiated by the merchant every days 
to the extent our gross margins decline from historical levels  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we face credit risks 
some participating merchants agree to pay a placement fee to us for including their merchandise in our programs 
we record an account receivable from the merchant for the placement fee 
in some cases  we collect the placement fee either from the merchant or by withholding it from amounts due to the merchant for merchandise sold 
to the extent that the placement fee receivable exceeds the sales of the merchant s products and the merchant is unable or unwilling to pay the difference to us  we may experience credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are vulnerable to increases in paper costs and airline fuel prices 
the cost of paper used to print our catalogs and the fees paid to airlines to reimburse them for the increased fuel costs associated with carrying our catalogs are significant expenses of our operations 
historically  paper and airline fuel prices have fluctuated significantly from time to time 
prices in the paper market can and often do change dramatically over a short period of time 
any significant increases in paper or airline fuel costs that we must pay could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our information and telecommunications systems may fail or be inadequate 
we process a large volume of relatively small orders 
consequently  our success depends to a significant degree on the effective operation of our information and telecommunications systems 
these systems could fail for unanticipated reasons or they may be inadequate to process any increase in our sales volume that may occur 
any extended failure of our information and telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks associated with on line security breaches or failures 
in order to successfully make sales over the internet  it is necessary that we be able to ensure the secure transmission of confidential customer information over public telecommunications networks 
we employ certain technology in order to protect such information  including customer credit card information 
however  there is no assurance that such information will not be intercepted illegally 
advances in cryptography or other developments that could compromise the security of confidential customer information could have a direct negative impact upon our electronic commerce business 
in addition  the perception by consumers that making purchases over the internet is not secure  even if unfounded  will mean that fewer consumers are likely to make purchases through that medium 
finally  any breach in security  whether or not a result of our acts or omissions  may cause us to be the subject of litigation  which could be very time consuming and expensive to defend 
our business is seasonal 
our business is seasonal in nature  with the greatest volume of sales typically occurring during the holiday selling season of the fourth calendar quarter 
during  approximately of our net merchandise sales were generated in the fourth quarter 
any substantial decrease in sales for the fourth quarter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face risks of increased governmental regulation and other legal uncertainties 
our electronic commerce activities are not currently subject to significant regulation  other than those applicable to businesses generally 
however  electronic commerce is a new market and it is likely that regulations and laws may be enacted in the future which would apply to our electronic commerce activities 
any such laws or regulations could result in additional costs associated with such activities  reduce or inhibit the growth of internet use  thereby reducing the growth of our electronic commerce business  or have other adverse effects 
additionally  certain states or international jurisdictions could enact laws that would require us to register in such jurisdictions  pay fees or otherwise increase our costs of doing business 
we face a risk of product liability claims 
our catalogs and electronic commerce sites typically feature over  products and services from more than participating merchants 
generally  our agreements with these participating merchants require the merchants to indemnify us and thereby be solely responsible for any losses arising from product liability claims made by customers  including the costs of defending any such claims  and to carry product liability insurance that names skymall as an additional insured 
in addition  we maintain product liability insurance in the aggregate amount of million and million per occurrence 
if a merchant was unable or unwilling to indemnify us as required  and any such losses exceeded our insurance coverage or were not covered by our insurer  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon our president and other key personnel 
we depend on the continued services of robert m 
worsley  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and on the services of certain other executive officers 
the loss of mr 
worsley s services or of the services of certain other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the worsleys can control many important company decisions 
as of march   mr 
worsley and his wife the worsleys beneficially own  shares  or approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  the worsleys have the ability to significantly influence the affairs of the company and matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of the company s directors  the amendment of the company s charter documents  the merger or dissolution of the company  and the sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
the voting power of the worsleys may also discourage or prevent any proposed takeover of the company pursuant to a tender offer 
the price of our common stock is extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile 
occurrences that could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate dramatically in the future include o new merchant agreements o the acquisition or loss of one or more airline  electronic commerce or other channel partners o fluctuations in our operating results o analyst reports  media stories  internet chat room discussions  news broadcasts and interviews o market conditions for retailers in general o changes in airline fuel  paper or our other significant expenses o decreases in the commissions we are able to negotiate with our merchants the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for companies that do some or all of their business on the internet 
although internet sales represent only a small portion of our business  the price of our common stock may nonetheless be impacted by these or other trends 
we face risks associated with the year background 
many software programs use only two digits to identify the year in the date field 
if such programs are not corrected  data that includes a date in the year or later could cause many computer applications to fail  lock up or generate erroneous results 
further  certain computer programs may not properly process the dates of september  or february  this potential problem is generally referred to as the year issue 
we have initiated a program to evaluate and address our exposure to the year issue 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
our state of readiness 
we have a program in process to identify our exposure to the year issue and we have begun to implement measures to mitigate any problems 
we believe we have identified all significant internal systems and applications that require attention of some form in order to address year issue risks 
our information or production systems which consist of order entry  order conveyance and customer service are primarily based on the microsoft suite of products and the hardware is principally late model compaq servers  both of which are designed and represented to meet year issue functional requirements 
we are in the process of testing these systems to confirm that they are year compliant 
we have other non production systems such as internal security systems  telephone systems  and network computer equipment  which we are also currently reviewing for year compliance 
in addition  we are surveying certain third parties  such as our vendor partners  banks and telephone service providers  to attempt to determine the year issue capability of their critical systems upon which our essential business operations are dependent 
costs 
the financial and resource demands of our year issue project are estimated to total less than  much of this amount represents existing resources which will be used to survey third parties  review internal and external systems environments  analyze potential impacts and document our efforts 
risks 
we believe that our most significant worst case year issue scenarios involve the inability of our vendors to process orders and conduct business such as arranging deliveries to customers and replenishing inventories 
we do not currently have enough data to make an accurate assessment of the potential impact of a material failure of our vendors to be adequately prepared for the year issue 
contingency plans 
we have not yet developed formal contingency plans to address the possibility that our critical systems  as well as those of our key business partners on which we rely  will experience significant interruption as a result of the year issue 
we will develop contingency plans in the coming months if such plans are deemed necessary after a more thorough evaluation of all of our mission critical systems and the results of our review of the systems of our third party providers 
uncertainty 
to the extent we are unable to adequately identify  evaluate and address all of the year issues relating to our business  or are unable to develop and implement effective contingency plans  we could experience a significant disruption of our ability to receive and process customer orders  in which case our financial condition and results of operations would be likely to be materially adversely affected
