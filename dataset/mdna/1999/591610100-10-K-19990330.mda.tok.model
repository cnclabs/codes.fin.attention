general the company is engaged primarily in the development  production and worldwide distribution of theatrical motion pictures and television programming 
see item business 
sources of revenue the principal sources of motion picture industry revenue are the domestic and international distribution of motion pictures  including theatrical exhibition  home video and television network  syndication  basic cable  pay and pay per view 
over the last decade  the relative contributions of these components of revenues have changed dramatically 
although revenues from domestic theatrical distribution have increased  growth in total motion picture industry revenues has resulted predominantly from increased revenues derived from the distribution of motion pictures internationally as well as from other media and distribution channels 
the company s feature films are exploited through a series of sequential domestic and international distribution channels  typically beginning with theatrical exhibition 
thereafter  feature films are first made available for home video generally six months after theatrical release  for pay television  one year after theatrical release  and for syndication  approximately three to five years after theatrical release 
the company s television programming is produced for initial broadcast on either pay  syndicated or network television in the united states  followed by international territories and  in some cases  worldwide video markets 
the company distributes its motion picture and television productions in foreign countries and  in recent years  has derived approximately percent of its revenues from foreign sources 
approximately percent of the company s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company incurs certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
the company  in certain instances  enters into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of its firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
these contracts generally mature within one year 
the company does not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes 
realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows were not material in any of the periods presented herein 
deferred gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts as of december  were not material

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
cost structure general 
in the motion picture industry  the largest component of the cost of producing a motion picture generally is the negative cost  which includes the above the line and below the line costs of producing the film 
above the line costs are costs related to the acquisition of picture rights and the costs associated with the producer  the director  the writer and the principal cast 
below the line costs are the remaining costs involved in producing the picture  such as film studio rental  principal photography  sound and editing 
distribution expenses consist primarily of the costs of advertising and preparing release prints 
the costs of advertising associated with a major domestic theatrical motion picture release are significant and typically involve national and target market media campaigns  as well as public appearances of a film s stars 
these advertising costs are separate from the advertising costs associated with other domestic distribution channels and the international market 
the major studios generally fund production costs from cash flow generated by motion picture and related distribution activities or bank and other financing methods 
over the past decade  expenses in the motion picture industry have increased rapidly as a result of increased production costs and distribution expenses 
additionally  each of the major studios must fund substantial overhead costs  consisting primarily of salaries and related costs of the production  distribution and administrative staffs  as well as facilities costs and other recurring overhead 
participations and residuals 
in connection with the production and distribution of a motion picture  major studios generally grant contractual rights to actors  directors  screenwriters  producers and other creative and financial contributors to share in the gross receipts or contractually defined net profits from a particular motion picture 
except for the most sought after talent  these third party participations are generally payable after all distribution fees  marketing expenses  direct production costs and financing costs are recouped in full 
major studios also typically incur obligations to pay residuals to various guilds and unions including the wga  the dga and the sag 
the residual payments are made on a picture by picture basis with respect to the exploitation of a motion picture in markets other than the primary intended markets for such picture and are calculated as a percentage of the gross revenues derived from the exploitation of the picture in these ancillary markets 
the company s cost structure for motion pictures generally follows the industry structure described above 
for a discussion of television programming cost structure  see item business the motion picture and television industry 
in recent years the company has experienced significant fluctuations in the level of its production activities 
in july a new management team was brought into mgm studios with a mandate to increase its production and distribution activities in anticipation of the eventual sale of mgm studios 
as a result  production and distribution expenditures increased substantially in and starting in january when cdr announced its intention to sell mgm studios through the sale of mgm studios on october   no new production was approved  and accordingly  production expenditures on new films decreased significantly during following the mgm acquisition in october  production activity increased as the company resumed a normalized production and distribution level 
these fluctuations in production and distribution expenditures had a material impact on operating results and cash flows during the related periods and will continue to do so at least through the end of industry accounting practices revenue recognition 
revenues from theatrical distribution of feature motion pictures are recognized on the dates of exhibition 
revenues from home video distribution  together with related costs  are recognized in the period in which the product is available assuming it has been shipped for sale at the retail level 
revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is available to the licensee for broadcast 
accounting for motion picture and television costs 
in accordance with gaap and industry practice  the company amortizes film and television programming costs using the individual film forecast method under which such costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management s estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such title 
management regularly reviews  and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates on a title by title basis  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and or a write down of the film or television asset to net realizable value 
a typical film or television program recognizes a substantial portion of its ultimate revenues within the first two years of release 
by then  a film has been exploited in the domestic and international theatrical markets and the domestic and international home video markets  as well as the domestic and international pay television and pay per view markets  and a television program has been exploited on network television or in first run syndication 
a similar portion of the film s or television program s capitalized costs should be expected to be amortized accordingly  assuming the film or television program is profitable 
the commercial potential of individual motion pictures and television programming varies dramatically  and is not directly correlated with production or acquisition costs 
therefore  it is difficult to predict or project a trend of the company s income or loss 
however  the likelihood of the company reporting losses  particularly in the year of a motion picture s release  is increased by the industry s method of accounting which requires the immediate recognition of the entire loss through increased amortization in instances where it is estimated the ultimate revenues of a motion picture or television program will not recover the company s costs 
on the other hand  the profit of a profitable motion picture or television program must be deferred and recognized over the entire revenue stream generated by that motion picture or television program 
this method of accounting may also result in significant fluctuations in reported income or loss  particularly on a quarterly basis  depending on the company s release schedule and the relative performance of individual motion pictures or television programs 
for films released by the company since january which resulted in feature film write downs in the period of initial release  subsequent performance as it relates to this group of films has not resulted in additional material write downs 
as a result of the lack of movie production and distribution during the sale period  the company expects to experience lower revenues at least through the end of  and thus the fluctuations caused by this accounting method may have a greater impact  than otherwise might be the case 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued an exposure draft on a proposed statement of position the proposed sop for accounting by producers and distributors of films 
if adopted  the proposed sop would establish new accounting and reporting standards for all producers and distributors that own or hold the rights to distribute or exploit films 
the proposed sop provides that the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles caused by adoption of the provisions of the sop should be included in the determination of net income in conformity with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
if adopted  the proposed sop  as currently drafted  would be effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged

factors affecting cash flow in  the rights offering 
the company s cash flow in was adversely affected by  and the company determined to undertake the rights offering as a result of  several factors 
first  during the company made and committed to make substantial investments that are more extensive than previously anticipated in connection with commitments entered into for new television programming 
this new television production includes an aggregate of approximately additional episodes for the company s non network programs 
such production also included new episodes of the magnificent seven which was a network program and thus produced at a greater deficit than the company s non network programs for the television season 
see item business production television production 
second  although tomorrow never dies and the man in the iron mask performed better than anticipated  the company s other major theatrical releases in performed below expectations 
the company s short term cash flow has been and will continue to be negatively affected by the unsuccessful releases  particularly during the ten to months after the release of such films 
although the company anticipates that the reduction in receipts due to the performance of such underperforming films will ultimately be offset in part by the increased ancillary cash receipts from the two successful releases  such ancillary cash receipts will be realized over several years 
third  the company s sales experience in the television syndication and home video markets has indicated that the cash that the company will collect from these sources will be realized over a longer period than originally anticipated 
fourth  during the first half of  the company accelerated certain theatrical motion picture production in order to avoid the impact of an industry strike that had been threatened in the second quarter of other factors include increases in marketing and distribution expenses that were higher than anticipated 
the company consummated the rights offering in november  issuing a total of  shares of the common stock for per share 
the total net proceeds to the company were approximately million gross proceeds of million less applicable fees and expenses of approximately million 
a portion of the net proceeds from the rights offering was used to repay in full the amounts outstanding under a million bridge loan  which had been accessed by the company in september in order to enhance the company s liquidity prior to the completion of the rights offering 
the remainder of the net proceeds was used to reduce borrowings then outstanding under the revolving facility 
current capital requirements 
the company s current strategy and business plan call for substantial on going investments  at levels comparable to  in the production of new feature films and television programs 
furthermore  the company may wish to continue to make investments in new distribution channels to further exploit the library 
the company plans to continue to evaluate the level of such investments in the context of the capital available to the company and changing market conditions 
in january  the company acquired the pfe libraries  containing over  feature films that were previously owned by polygram  for million 
the purchase was funded by borrowings under the revolving facility and utilization of cash on hand 
in march  in consideration for the early expiration of the whv agreement  the company agreed to pay whv million  of which million was paid in march and the remaining million installment is payable in september additionally  the company reconveyed to whv the rights that the company had to distribute in the home video markets worldwide until june   approximately  titles in the turner library that had been serviced under the whv agreement 
this reconveyance to whv was made effective as of january  the company intends to record a one time pre tax contract termination charge in the first quarter of of approximately million for costs in connection with terminating the whv agreement 
the company anticipates that the reconveyance of the turner rights will result in decreased cash flow to the company of approximately million per year through june the remaining million installment plus interest at the rate of eight percent per year from march payable to whv in september is secured by a standby letter of credit issued by one of the company s principal lenders the letter of credit 
if the letter of credit is drawn upon  the company will be deemed to have accessed a seven and one half year term loan from such lender with a principal amount equal to the amount drawn 
such term loan would bear interest at percent over adjusted libor rate 
interest would be payable quarterly in arrears and principal of such loan would be due on the earlier of maturity or upon any equity or debt issuance by the company 
the company is obligated to fund percent of the expenses of mgm networks latin america up to a maximum of approximately million 
the company has funded approximately million under such obligation as of december  see item business distribution international pay and free television 
the company expects to incur approximately million of additional costs in in connection with the integration of the pfe library and the company s transition to home video self distribution 
the company s obligation to pay other capital requirements  including the purchase of certain computer systems and equipment and other improvements  are currently not expected to exceed million per year 
in addition  the slate of films released by the company in to date have performed below expectations 
as a result of these various factors including  in particular  the short term costs associated with the accelerated termination of the whv agreement  cash flow from operations and the amounts available under the existing tranches of the amended credit facility are not expected to be adequate to meet the company s obligations and commitments and to enable the company to continue to conduct is operations in accordance with its current business plan through the end of therefore  the company is currently considering various alternatives to increase the company s capital resources 
the company believes that several different sources of increased liquidity may be available 
the company is currently considering various film financing alternatives 
additionally  the company may seek to access the million tranche c loan 
accessing the tranche c loan would require the consent of lenders holding at least two thirds of the amounts outstanding or available under the amended credit facility and the commitment by such or other lenders of the requisite funds 
the company may also seek additional equity financing  including through another rights offering 
while management of the company believes that it will be able to obtain the requisite funds  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain any such debt or equity financing  or otherwise obtain the requisite funds  or that it will be able to do so on a timely basis and on terms acceptable to the company 
if necessary in order to manage its cash needs  the company may also seek to reduce or delay its production or release schedules and to further increase its use of co production  split rights or other partnering arrangements 
there can be no assurance that any such steps by the company to reduce its cash needs would be adequate or timely  or that acceptable arrangements could be reached with third parties if necessary 
in addition  although changes in the company s production or release schedule or the increased use of partnering would diminish the company s short term cash needs and in the case of partnering reduce the company s risk relating to the performance of the relevant films  such steps could adversely affect long term cash flow and results of operations in subsequent periods 
the company intends to continue to pursue its goal of becoming an integrated global entertainment company 
in connection with its pursuit of this goal  the company may consider various strategic alternatives  such as business combinations with companies with strengths complementary to those of the company and other acquisitions  as opportunities arise 
the nature  size and structure of any such acquisition could require the company to seek additional financing 
year data conversion impact of the year issue introduction 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date field 
state of readiness 
the company s primary focus has been on its own internal systems 
to date  the company has completed the year conversion with respect to all of its most critical computer systems and applications  which constitute approximately percent of the company s year sensitive systems together with those systems containing embedded microprocessors or other technology  systems 
the company is in the testing or remediation phase with respect to the remainder of its systems  which include most of the company s computer hardware and other equipment containing embedded microprocessors or other technology 
the company expects to complete its year conversion by june  because of the substantial progress made by the company towards its year conversion  the company does not anticipate that any additional significant changes will be required or that the year issue will pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if any necessary changes are not made or completed in a timely fashion or unanticipated problems arise  the year issue may take longer for the company to address and may have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has had communications with certain of its significant suppliers  distributors  financial institutions  lessors and others with which it does business to evaluate their year compliance plans and state of readiness and to determine the extent to which the company s systems may be affected by the failure of others to remediate their own year issues 
the company is also distributing a year assessment form to other parties  in order to provide the company with further information as to their year conversion progress 
to date  the company has received feedback from certain but not all of such parties  and has not independently confirmed any information received with respect to the year issues 
as such  there can be no assurance that parties will complete their year conversion in a timely fashion or will not suffer a year business disruption that may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
costs to address the year issue 
to date  the company estimates that it has spent approximately million to address the year issue  with the majority of the work being performed by company employees 
the aggregate cost to achieve year conversion is estimated to be approximately million 
the company intends to fund such costs from its operations and funds borrowed under the amended credit facility 
the company believes such costs will not have a material adverse effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
however  as the company progresses with its year conversion and implements any necessary changes to its systems  certain additional costs may be identified 
there can be no assurance that such additional costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks of year issues 
to date  the company has not identified any system which presents a material risk of not being year ready in a timely fashion or for which a suitable alternative cannot be implemented 
however  as the company progresses with its year conversion  the company may identify systems which do present a material risk of year disruption 
such disruption may include  among other things  the inability to process transactions or information  record and access data relating to the availability of titles in the company s library for licensing and distribution  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the failure of the company to identify systems which require year conversion that are critical to the company s operations or the failure of the company or others with which the company does business to become year ready in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
contingency plans 
while the company s year conversion is expected to be completed prior to any potential disruption to the company s business  the company acknowledges the uncertainties involved in preparing its systems for the year as such  the company is developing a comprehensive year specific contingency plan 
as part of its year contingency effort  information received from external sources is examined for date integrity before being brought into the company s internal systems 
if the company determines that its business or a segment thereof is at material risk of disruption due to the year issue or anticipates that its year conversion will not be completed in a timely fashion  the company will work to further enhance its contingency plan 
the discussion above contains certain forward looking statements 
the costs of the year conversion  the date which the company has set to complete such conversion and possible risks associated with the year issue are based on the company s current estimates and are subject to various uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
such uncertainties include  among others  the success of the company in identifying systems that are not year compliant  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected systems  the availability of qualified personnel  consultants and other resources  and the success of the year conversion efforts of others 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of interest rate changes the company has only limited involvement in derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
certain amounts borrowed under the company s amended credit facility are at variable interest rates and the company is thus subject to market risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
the company enters into interest rate swaps in part to alter interest rate exposures 
interest rate swaps allow the company to raise long term borrowings at floating rates and effectively swap them into fixed rates that are lower than those available to the company if fixed rate borrowings were made directly 
under interest rate swaps  the company agrees with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount
