continucare s consolidated net loss for the year ended june  was approximately  compared to net income for fiscal of approximately  for the reasons discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s financial position has changed significantly since june  throughout fiscal and the company experienced adverse business operations  recurring operating losses  negative cash flow from operations  resulting in a significant working capital deficiency 
furthermore  as discussed below  the company was unable to make certain of its scheduled interest payments 
the company s operating difficulties have in large part been due to the underperformance of various entities which were acquired in fiscal years  and  the inability to effectively integrate and realize increased profitability through anticipated economies of scale with these acquisitions  as well as reductions in reimbursement rates under the balanced budget act of in addition  the company s independent auditors included a paragraph in their auditors report on the company s consolidated financial statements at june  regarding the substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the discussion herein has been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
in order to strengthen itself financially and remain a going concern  the company  during the past fiscal year  began divesting itself of certain unprofitable operations and disposing of other underperforming assets as more fully discussed below 
the company did not make the april  the default date semi annual payment of interest on its convertible subordinated notes payable 
as of june   the company had  principal amount outstanding under the convertible subordinated notes payable and accrued and unpaid interest of approximately  the amount of interest due as of april  was  within thirty days of the default date  the company commenced negotiations with an informal committee of the holders of the convertible subordinated notes payable to restructure a portion of the debt and related interest in exchange for common stock and to obtain terms on the remaining portion of the debt that are more favorable to the company 
on or about july  the company purchased  face value of its convertible subordinated notes payable for approximately  recognizing a pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately  the company funded the purchase of the convertible subordinated notes payable from working capital 
on september  the company announced an agreement in principle with the holders of the convertible subordinated notes payable to enter into a settlement and restructuring agreement with respect to the remaining  principal balance and approximately  of interest thereon accrued through october  also  see item recent developments debt restructuring and note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the company entered into the credit facility with first union bank 
the credit facility provided for a  acquisition facility and a  revolving loan 
the company borrowed the entire  acquisition facility to fund acquisitions 
the company never utilized the revolving loan 
since december  the company has not been in compliance with the terms and conditions of the acquisition facility 
during april  the company used approximately  of the net proceeds from the sale of certain of the rationalized entities to reduce the outstanding balance of the credit facility 
in connection with the payment  the company entered into an amendment to the credit facility  which provided  among other things  for the repayment of the remaining outstanding principal balance of approximately  by december  for the twelve months ended june   the company incurred a net loss of  and the net cash used in operating activities was  primarily as a result of the net loss  offset by i non cash operating items  including depreciation and amortization  provision for bad debt  loss on sale of subsidiary and write down of long lived assets  and ii increase in medical claims payable 
for the twelve months ended june   net cash provided by investing activities was  net cash used in financing activities for the twelve months ended june  was a  comprised primarily of the  borrowed under the credit facility  partially offset by repayment of  on the credit facility and approximately  on other debts 
also  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s working capital deficit was approximately  at june   which includes the reclassification of  of convertible notes to current liabilities due to the company s default on the april  interest payment  compared to working capital of approximately  at june  during the twelve months ended june   capital expenditures amounted to approximately  the company continues to take steps to improve its cash flow and profitability through the implementation of its business rationalization program and financial restructuring program by divesting of its non profitable business units  reducing personnel levels  negotiating with the subordinated notes payable holders  and negotiating with its hmos 
while the company believes that these measures will improve its cash flow and profitability  there can be no assurances that it will be able to implement any of the above steps and  if implemented  the steps will improve the company s cash flow and profitability sufficiently to fund its operations and satisfy its obligations as they become due 
if there are continuing operating losses  continucare may need additional capital to fund its business  and there can be no assurance that such additional capital can be obtained or  if obtained  that it will be on terms acceptable to continucare 
the incurring or assumption by the company of additional indebtedness could result in the issuance of additional equity and or debt which could have a dilutive effect on shareholders and a significant effect on the company s operations 
in addition to the company s liquidity difficulties  the company is experiencing administrative difficulties  including the loss of key personnel 
also  the company has fallen below the continued listing requirements of the american stock exchange and there can be no assurance that the listing will be continued 
impact of year the year issue is the result of the computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations and patient care  including  among other things  a failure of certain patient care applications and equipment  a failure of control systems  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent and ongoing assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace certain portions of its software  hardware and patient care equipment so that its systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
affected systems will include clinical and biomedical instrumentation and equipment used within the company for purposes of direct or indirect patient care such as imaging  laboratory  pharmacy and respiratory devices  cardiology measurement and support devices  emergency care devices including monitors  defibrillators  dialysis equipment and ventilators  and general patient care devices including telemetry equipment and intravenous pumps 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new clinical and biomedical instrumentation and equipment  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace and test the software and patient care equipment for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year project by december   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total projected cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software and patient care equipment  which will be capitalized 
the remaining  will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of replacement equipment and personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
the operations of the company are heavily dependent on its management information systems 
implementation of new management information systems and integration of management information systems in connection with acquisitions require a transition period during which various functions must be converted or integrated to the new systems 
this conversion and integration process may entail errors  defects or prolonged downtime  especially at the outset  and such errors  defects or downtime could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  prospects  financial results  financial condition or cash flows 
both the software and hardware used by the company in connection with the services it provides have been subject to rapid technological change 
although the company believes that its technology can be upgraded as necessary  the development of new technologies or refinements of existing technology could make the company s existing equipment obsolete 
although the company is not currently aware of any pending technological developments that would be likely to have a material adverse effect on its business  there is no assurance that such developments will not occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s at june   the company had only cash equivalents  invested in high grade  very short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
the company has outstanding loans at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on the company s future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments
