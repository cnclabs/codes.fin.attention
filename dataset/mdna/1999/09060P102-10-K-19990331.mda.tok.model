year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
some computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business and operating activities 
some of the company s systems are year compliant 
the company has a program in place to assess the remaining software and systems and bring them into year compliance in time to minimize any significant detrimental effects on operations 
the program focuses on three main functional areas i information technology which addresses data  phone and administrative systems  including personal computers  telecommunications  local area networks  wide area networks and business applications 
these systems are computer devices and software that the company wrote or purchased which are not supported by external vendors 
the software systems include applications developed or purchased by corporate departments and operated by departmental personnel 
the computer devices are desktop personal computers and server computer equipment including system hardware  firmware  and installed commercial application software 
ii embedded chip technology which addresses manufacturing systems  laboratory instruments and plant maintenance systems with programmable logic controllers with date functions 
the process control and environmental monitoring and control systems are used in the company s manufacturing and research and development processes  among other operations 
these generally are systems  devices and instruments which utilize date functionality and generate  send  receive or manipulate date stamped data and signals 
these systems may be found in data acquisition processing software  laboratory instrumentation  and other equipment with embedded code 
iii material suppliers and marketing partners which address third parties that are critical to the company s manufacturing process and distribution of product 
the company has identified critical providers of information  goods and services in order to assess their year compliance readiness 
the company has sent letters to all critical and regular suppliers and marketing partners 
although the company cannot control the response time to its letters  the company hopes to have assessed all letters by may  and confirmed year readiness of selected suppliers and marketing partners by june  the company recognizes that to a certain degree it is relying on information provided by such third parties regarding their year compliance readiness 
while the company is attempting to evaluate information provided by these third parties  there can be no assurance that in all instances accurate information is being provided 
failure of these third parties systems to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in order to address the three noted areas  the company has divided the project into four phases including awareness  assessment  validation  and implementation along the functional departments of the company 
the company has completed the awareness and assessment phases for all functional areas 
the company expects to complete the validation phase by april  full implementation and compliance for all functional areas is expected by september the company is using both internal and external resources to identify  correct reprogram  and test its computer systems  equipment and software for year compliance 
the company estimates that the costs associated with the year issue will not be material  and as such will not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
however  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company believes that  with the implementation of the year program  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced 
to date the company estimates that it has spent approximately million replacing  upgrading  or repairing systems or equipment 
the aggregate additional costs of the company s year program cannot be known at this time 
however  given the current status of the validation phase the additional costs are expected to be approximately million 
the actual additional costs will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the costs of replacing  upgrading or repairing systems  software and equipment  and consulting fees and expenses 
all costs are expected to be funded through operations 
the company is also developing a contingency plan to address a situation in which year problems do cause an interruption in normal business activities 
once developed  contingency plans and related cost estimates will be continually refined  as additional information becomes available 
the company expects to have the contingency plan in place for critical operations by june there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete all of the modifications in the required time frame  that unanticipated events will not occur or that the company will be able to identify all year issues before problems arise 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the statements set forth herein concerning the year problem which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
there can be no guarantee that any estimates or other forward looking statements will be achieved and actual results could differ significantly from those planned or contemplated 
the company plans to update the status of its year program as necessary in its periodic filings and in accordance with applicable securities laws
