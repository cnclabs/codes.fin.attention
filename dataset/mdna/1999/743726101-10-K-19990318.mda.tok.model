swiss was experiencing modest growth and increased profits until the august  fire destroyed its main meat plant 
swiss has attempted to maintain volume until its new plant is operational by purchasing products from other suppliers for its customers  but since the fire  swiss s sales have been almost  per month lower and swiss has operated at a loss  realizing a pre tax profit only after taking into account the benefits of business interruption insurance 
the pasta division s sales decreased about in dollars and in pounds but its operating income increased in from the pasta division s sales for the th quarter of were down in dollars and in pounds from the same quarter of the sales decreases in pounds did not result in proportionate decreases in dollars because of higher average selling prices from a lower proportion of high volume lower priced sales 
the decreases in sales in pounds reflect competition resulting from increasing industry capacity 
the large decrease in the th quarter of partly reflects a surge in sales a year ago  when sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the th quarter of royal s increased operating income resulted from higher production labor efficiency  a lower proportion of high volume sales and lower flour costs

administrative expense was up about  primarily due to increased officer payroll  health care costs and outside services  partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
net interest changed from an expense to income because of the absence of borrowing under the bank line  a lower balance on the term loan  repayment of the term loan and interest income on higher cash balances

the royal pasta division s sales increased about in dollars and in pounds and its operating income increased in over the pasta division s sales for the th quarter of were up in dollars and in pounds over the same quarter of the sales increases in pounds did not result in proportionate increases in dollars because of lower average selling prices caused by price competition and a higher proportion of high volume sales 
the cost of semolina flour increased about in and had remained well above pre levels through royal had been expecting a tension between high flour prices and increased price competition caused by increasing industry capacity 
flour prices increased slightly in  but royal succeeded in increasing its sales and operating income

administrative expense was down about  primarily due to a decrease in officer payroll at royal  as well as lower health care costs and consulting services relating to swiss and other outside services  partially offset by higher clerical payroll and bad debt expense 
other income increased about  because of a  state reimbursement of the cost of removal of a gasoline storage tank at the former distribution division warehouse

the business interruption claims are ongoing and there has been no final settlement for any of the claims 
the company has generally satisfied its normal working capital requirements with funds derived from operations and borrowings under a bank line of credit 
the company had  unsecured line of credit with wells fargo bank  na which was replaced by a  line of credit with comerica bank california on september  at december   the company had had no borrowings under either line for over months 
the company also had a term loan with well fargo bank  na secured by the nd royal building with a balance of  at june   which the company prepaid on july   using funds on hand 
the comerica line of credit is part of a credit facility proposed by comerica for the company s financial needs  including the need to finance the acquisition and construction of a new meat plant 
the line is payable on demand  is subject to annual review  and bears interest at a variable annual rate  at the company s option  of either over comerica s cost of funds or under its base rate 
also as part of the credit facility  comerica has issued a  letter of credit which expires october  and secures payment of principal and interest on  of industrial development bonds which were issued october   mature october  and produced  of net proceeds for acquisition and construction of the company s new meat plant 
the company is obligated to pay principal and interest on the bonds 
comerica is not obligated to renew the letter of credit  but the company is obligated to maintain a like letter of credit until the bonds mature 
the bonds are initially demand obligations remarketed upon repayment and bear a variable rate of interest payable monthly and set weekly at a market rate  initially per annum and at january  the company pays a per annum fee on the amount of the letter of credit and fees of the bond trustee estimated at of the bond principal per year 
beginning may  and continuing until the bonds mature  the company is obligated to make monthly principal payments into an interest bearing fund  with the principal used annually to redeem the bonds and the interest accruing to the benefit of the company 
the monthly payments aggregate  the first year and increase about each year until may   when  of remaining principal is payable in equal monthly payments 
the company has the option to convert the bonds to bonds with principal payable at the end of a fixed term and interest payable semi annually at a fixed rate set at the minimum rate of interest at which the converted bonds are remarketed

all parts of the credit facility prohibits mergers  acquisitions  disposal of assets  borrowing  granting security interests  and changes of management and requires a tangible net worth greater than  a debt to tangible net worth ratio less than  a quick ratio greater than  and cash flow coverage greater than 
on september    the company purchased a acre parcel of land in the city of lathrop  county of san joaquin  california  for a purchase price of  plus fees and commissions  as the site for the new meat plant 
construction of the  square foot building to house the new meat plant is in progress with the completion scheduled for the st half of the estimated cost of acquisition and construction of the new meat plant is currently over  including over  for general construction by ap thomas construction  inc  the general contractor  over  for electrical  refrigeration  and specialty installations by other contractors under direct contract with the company and the balance primarily for site cost  developer fees  commissions  utility fees  and architectural and engineering fees 
the move to the new plant will require charging to expense the net capitalized leasehold improvements and the future rent on the remaining san francisco building through lease expiration in  reduced by future rent under any agreed sublease  or reduced to termination costs if there is an agreed early termination of the lease 
the annual cost to swiss of the new meat plan will exceed the annual cost of its old meat plant  and reduced volume because of the fire will increase the difficulty of building the volume at the new plant to profitable levels 
additions to property and equipment of about  are anticipated for  plus the cost of the new meat plant

operating activities produced  primarily from earnings  depreciation  large decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  and an increase in deferred taxes  partially offset by an increase in other receivables 
investing activities used about  primarily for land purchase  progress payments and other capitalized costs of a new plant at swiss 
financing activities produced about  from the proceeds of the industrial development bonds  reduced by prepayment of the term loan and by the excess of cash dividends paid over net stock proceeds 
accounts receivable and inventories decreased because of the fire and subsequent reduced sales at swiss 
the deferred taxes arose from a gain of insurance proceeds exceeding the net book value of leasehold improvements and equipment lost in the fire 
the gain is not currently taxable but reduces future tax deductions for depreciation on the replacement improvements and equipment 
the other receivables are unpaid insurance proceeds relating to the fire 
in cash increased about  operating activities produced about  primarily from earnings  depreciation  a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued liabilities

investing activities used about  for net capital expenditures and financing activities used about  for dividends offset by net stock proceeds 
the company s inventories and accounts receivable normally reflect the level of its sales  and in sales were up  resulting in about a  increase in account receivable and about a  increase in inventories  following about a  reduction in inventories in on reduced sales 
in quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid if the board believes that earnings and cash flow are adequate

under the plan  employees other than officers and directors may authorize weekly payroll deductions which are matched by the company and used monthly to purchase shares from the company at the market price 
the weekly payroll deduction is from to for each participant 
the matching funds are an expense incurred by the company  but the plan results in net cash flow to the company because amounts equal to twice the matching funds are used to purchase shares from the company
