item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves as long as they identify these statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results 
all statements other than statements of historical fact made in this annual report on form k are forward looking 
in particular  statements herein regarding future results of operations and financial position  the company s ability to develop and introduce new products  the company s ability to manage its rapid growth  its ability to integrate the operations of rcf  the assessment of the company s year and euro compliance exposures and completion of remediation efforts  and any other guidance on future periods are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations 
the following discussions and the section entitled business cautionary factors that may affect future results describe some  but not all  of the factors that could cause these differences 
the company derives its operating revenue from worldwide sales of audio mixers  speakers and other professional audio equipment 
sales outside the us account for a significant portion of the company s total sales 
international sales volumes have historically been affected by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
when weaknesses of local currencies have made the company s products more expensive  sales to those countries have declined 
the company s gross margins are also affected by its international sales 
typically  gross margins from exported products by mackie are lower than from those sold in the us due to discounts offered to its international distributors 
rcf does not offer discounts to its distributors 
the discounts offered by mackie are given because the international distributor typically incurs certain expenses  including technical support  product service and in country advertising  that the company normally incurs for domestic sales 
the company offered its international distributors a weighted average discount of approximately in  in  and in the decrease in discounts in is attributable to the lack of discounts offered by rcf 
sales outside the us represented approximately   and of the company s net sales in  and  respectively 
the company s gross margins are also affected by the purchase of some components outside of the us and italy 
as a result of fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar and italian lira  some of the company s international component suppliers have increased prices and may further increase prices 
the company employs foreign exchange hedging strategies for certain currencies to help mitigate the effect of currency fluctuations 
the company s gross margins have fluctuated from time to time due primarily to inefficiencies related to the introduction and manufacturing of new products and inefficiencies associated with integrating new equipment into the company s manufacturing processes 
historically  fluctuations have also resulted from varying prices of components and competitive pressures 
the company plans to introduce new products and product revisions at a more rapid rate than it has in the past 
some anticipated new products will require the implementation of manufacturing practices with which the company is not familiar 
this could result in lower margins as the company becomes more familiar with new manufacturing procedures 
results of operations year ended december  as compared with year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of operations for rcf beginning july  net sales the company s net sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of rcf s sales of million 
sales outside the us increased to of the company s total net sales in from in this increase was due mainly to the inclusion of sales by rcf whose sales outside of the us comprised of its total net sales for the six months ended december  cost of sales gross profit was million in compared with million in the increase was largely attributable to the inclusion of rcf s gross profit of million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin percentage was due primarily to a difference in product mix for compared with as sales of certain product lines provided higher gross margins than other product lines 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of marketing and sales expenses for rcf of million

this increase was also due to increased legal expenses due to the lawsuit filed by the company against certain parties alleging infringement of its intellectual property rights see item  legal proceedings in this form k 
as a percentage of net sales  administrative expenses were in compared with in research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to in from in the corresponding period of this decrease was due primarily to decreases in prototype and other expenditures 
r d expenses for rcf were  mackie has historically incurred a higher percentage of r d expenses as a percentage of net sales when compared with rcf due to a higher level of product development and innovation 
interest income and interest expense interest income decreased to  in compared with  in due to a lower average cash balance 
interest expense increased to  in from none in primarily due to borrowings related to the acquisition of rcf and to interest bearing debt carried by rcf

the provision for income taxes for of  represented an overall effective rate for of 
the decrease in the overall effective rate in compared with the statutory rate is primarily due to the benefits provided by the company s foreign sales corporation and the research and development tax credit 
year ended december  as compared with year ended december  net sales the company s net sales increased to million in from million in the increase in sales was primarily attributable to sales from new products the sr  fr series power amplifiers  and the hr active studio monitor  partially offset by a decrease in sales in two mixer product lines the bus series mixers and compact mixers 
sales of the sr which became available in december  fr series power amplifiers which became available in december  and the hr active studio monitor which became available in august accounted for of net sales in sales of the bus series mixers decreased to of net sales in from in sales of compact mixers were of net sales in compared with in sales outside the us represented of the company s net sales in both and cost of sales gross profit was million in compared with million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin percentage was due to start up costs associated with initial production of the sr and the fr series tm power amplifier  both of which were shipped in significant quantities for the first time in the first quarter of the gross margin percentage decrease was also due to a higher weighted average discount offered to international distributors 
additionally  the decrease in gross margin percentage was due to a difference in product mix in compared with as sales of certain product lines provided lower gross margins than other product lines

liquidity and capital resources the company used internally generated cash to finance its operations during and the company s operating activities generated cash of  in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to net income  depreciation and amortization  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in from million in  due principally to the acquisition of rcf and purchases of furniture and equipment 
the company had no significant capital expenditure commitments at december  the company intends to finance its capital expenditures from cash provided by operations  current cash reserves and existing credit facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared with net cash used in financing activities during of million 
the cash provided by financing activities in was due principally to proceeds from bank credit facilities used for the acquisition of rcf 
during  the company repurchased approximately  shares of its own stock at a total cost of million 
in june  the company entered into a credit agreement with a bank to provide certain credit facilities to the company  including a million loan for the acquisition of rcf of which million was outstanding at december  unused amounts under the loan may be used for general corporate purposes 
the loan  which is secured by all of the company s assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate  or at a specified libor rate plus a specified margin  whichever the company chooses 
interest under the loan is payable monthly 
principal is payable in installments equal to of the amount borrowed on september of each year commencing september  all outstanding principal and interest amounts are due on september  the agreement also provides a million unsecured line of credit to finance any unexpected working capital requirements 
the line of credit bears interest at the same rate as the acquisition loan 
the agreement also provides a million credit facility for capital equipment purchases or general corporate purposes 
certain terms under this facility  such as interest rate  repayment period and collateral  will be determined at the time advances are made to the company 
the company also has a million line of credit for the purchase of foreign exchange contracts 
at december   there was  outstanding on the million line of credit and there were no outstanding balances on the other credit lines 
these credit facilities excluding the acquisition loan expire april  under the terms of the credit agreement  the company must maintain certain financial ratios and tangible net worth 
the company is in compliance with all such covenants 
the agreement also provides  among other matters  restrictions on additional financing  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions 
the agreement also imposes an annual capital expenditure limit of million 
rcf has entered into agreements with several banks that provide short term credit facilities totaling approximately million 
at december   there was approximately million outstanding under these facilities 
the majority of these credit facilities are secured by rcf s receivables 
interest rates on these credit facilities range from to 
rcf also has various long term loans outstanding at december   totaling approximately million  which bear interest at rates from to 
these loans mature at varying dates up to and certain of these loans are secured by specific assets of rcf 
the company has granted options to various individuals to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   options to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices of per share to per share are outstanding and  of these options are exercisable 
the exercise of these options would provide additional cash to the company 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with cash generated from operations and cash available from credit facilities will be sufficient to finance the company s operations at least through inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effects of inflation  the company does not believe inflation has had or is likely to have a material effect on its results of operations or liquidity 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates during the period 
to date  the foreign currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted the company s profitability 
year issue the year issue or yk refers to the practice of many existing computer programs using only the last two digits when designating a year 
therefore  these programs cannot distinguish a year that begins with from a year that begins with if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results beginning january  the following analysis addresses the issues at the company s locations in woodinville  washington referred to as mackie woodinville and in italy referred to as rcf 
readiness information system enterprise resource planning system erp 
yk inspection at mackie woodinville has revealed two systems requiring updating the shipping manifest system  and the general ledger module of the manufacturing system 
integration of the replacement shipping system is scheduled to begin march and be completed in april the general ledger module is to be replaced by a yk compliant version from the software developer 
this work is scheduled to begin may  and be completed by the end of the second quarter of both of these systems  if left unchanged  would run correctly until december  rcf completed the analysis of its system in mid its erp was determined to be yk non compliant and implementation of a solution began february the project is scheduled to have the first release of converted software available for testing in early april  with a six week test cycle to follow 
the problem resolution phase of the project is scheduled to run for a six week period following the test cycle 
the revised software is scheduled to be in place in july at present  the project is on schedule 
information systems hardware 
hardware at mackie woodinville has undergone a preliminary review showing no major problems 
a detailed pc hardware analysis is under way and is scheduled to be completed by april  server hardware has already been found to be yk compliant 
the primary erp server at mackie recently had its unix operating system upgraded to make it entirely yk compliant 
other equipment with embedded systems are currently also being inspected  with completion scheduled for the end of the second quarter of rcf has purchased all server hardware required for yk compliance 
the new hardware will be used initially for testing of the yk modifications  then run as the live system following the conversion 
the pc and network server analyses are expected to take place in october the company does not consider this to be a point of risk given that  with the exception of a small number of pcs  all hardware is new and yk compliant 
vendors 
mackie woodinville has undergone a process to evaluate the yk preparedness of its critical vendors 
of these vendors  any that are in the process of completing their yk preparations will be audited quarterly for progress 
mackie woodinville has in place a plan to evaluate the cost and time to develop alternate sources for goods  plus a program to evaluate the cost and storage requirements to ensure an uninterrupted supply of goods while engaging alternate suppliers 
rcf has begun the process of identifying key vendors and assessing the yk compliance of these vendors 
vendors will be asked about their yk compliance plans and based on their responses  rcf plans to take appropriate actions to mitigate the possible impact of yk issues 
customers 
a customer evaluation process is being put in place by mackie woodinville to ensure that critical customers will be compliant 
of these customers who are not already yk compliant  those preparing for yk compliance will be audited quarterly 
these customers may ultimately receive an onsite visit and be asked to demonstrate contingency plans if yk preparation efforts do not appear to be adequate or timely 
rcf plans to assess customer yk issues through direct inquiry of key customers 
based on their responses  rcf will determine the steps that need to be taken to minimize the impact of yk issues 
products 
all mackie products using microprocessors or other digital based technology have been reviewed and found to be yk compliant 
all rcf products are manufactured without a microprocessor or other digital based technology and  therefore  are not affected by yk issues 
costs all yk resolution issues at mackie woodinville have been budgeted at less than  rcf has a total yk budget of  all costs are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
risks risk to mackie woodinville is fairly low regarding issues that are directly within the company s control 
systems at risk of failure are scheduled to be yk compliant by the end of the second quarter of  and would not fail until january  external influences are being managed to minimize any potential impact on the business 
the greatest risk for rcf is in the conversion of the manufacturing mrp module of its erp 
in this area  the most likely error would be one of missing the conversion of a date field  or the incorrect conversion of a date 
the company contracted to do this conversion will be available following the go live date on the converted software and will support the system on a maintenance agreement 
another point of risk is the timing of availability of the converted software for installation  although this risk is deemed by the company to be fairly low 
contingency plans contingency plans are being worked on for rcf in the event that software is not available for installation until some period after the scheduled go live date 
the primary focus is on the manufacturing system and mrp 
research is being done on finding an option to quickly port critical manufacturing information over to a backup system to keep the company running for a short period should the converted software not be available by the required date 
if the remediation efforts of the company s key suppliers and customers are unsuccessful in dealing with yk problems and if the company s efforts to mitigate the impact of such problems are unsuccessful  there may be a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated results and financial condition 
the company is unable to quantify any potential impact at this time  but will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation 
euro conversion with the introduction of the euro  european business systems are being forced to handle currencies in a new way 
there are many rules governing precisely how these systems must act when transacting the euro 
greatly simplified  some of the systems related business issues include as of january   it is optional to use euro in business transactions in participating countries 
an example of the impact would be companies may request to be invoiced in euro and the company writing the invoice is obliged to do so 
during the period of optional compliance  a company may choose to run its financial systems in its existing currency  or in euro 
as of january   there will be mandatory euro compliance in participating countries 
at this time  it will be necessary to make all financial transactions within the participating countries using euro  as well as run the financial systems with the base currency being euro 
in the past it was possible for a system to simply multiply or divide by some factor to find the amount of exchange between two currencies 
under the rules governing the euro  it will soon be necessary to triangulate the exchange between any two non euro currencies by first exchanging to euro  then to the target currency 
there are a minimum number of digits of precision that are to be carried throughout all exchange calculations 
rcf s computer system does not support the euro currency  and at this time it is believed that reprogramming the system is likely not an economically viable option 
until a euro solution is implemented  the current system must continue to be used 
one major shortcoming of doing so is the ability of this system to invoice multiple currencies when a value added tax vat is being applied 
currently  the system is only able to properly apply vat to lira denominated invoices 
this means that euro invoices for italian customers who request to be billed in euros instead of lira will need to be done external to the primary business system 
although the date for mandatory euro compliance is january   it is believed that the existing system will be utilized until mid after which time the effort to run a non compliant system will increase to the point that it s no longer a feasible option 
the task of making rcf euro compliant has already begun with the investigation of alternate systems 
the cost to achieve euro compliance for rcf is currently unknown 
share repurchase program the company has been authorized by its board of directors to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock 
these purchases may be executed through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  and may commence or be discontinued at any time 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately  shares under this program at a total cost of approximately million 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company does not have any derivative financial instruments as of december  however  the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in the market risk of its marketable securities 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and european interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as interest paid on debt 
the company has lines of credit and other debt whose interest rates are based on various published prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
foreign currency risk the company operates subsidiaries in italy  the united kingdom  germany  france  the netherlands and china 
the company s business and financial condition is  therefore  sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies 
the company employs foreign exchange hedging strategies for certain currencies to help mitigate the effect of currency fluctuations 
to date  the foreign currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted the company s profitability
