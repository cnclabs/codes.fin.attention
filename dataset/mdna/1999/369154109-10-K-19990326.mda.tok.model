gbc annual report management s discussion and analysis gbc and subsidiaries year compliance in  gbc began identifying issues and formulating plans to address year matters that might impact its operations 
the year problems consist of shortcomings in certain electronic data processing systems that make them unable to process year date data accurately beyond the year essentially  certain systems were designed to abbreviate dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year under the assumption that these digits would always be as a result  such applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather then gbc s state of readiness in early  gbc established a year task force which is directed by gbc s vice president of business technology 
the task force has identified and reviewed gbc s hardware and software systems  embedded technological systems  gbc s product offerings  and material third party relationships 
gbc s state of readiness is as follows substantially all of its hardware systems are year compliant 
certain software systems are being modified or replaced to become year compliant 
surveys have been sent to more than material third party suppliers 
approximately of the surveys have been returned and are currently being assessed by management of gbc s business units to determine if the failure of any material supplier to have its products or services compliant could materially adversely affect the results of gbc s business or operations 
the significant projects currently in process are summarized below operating function project current status target completion north american document remediate order processing  distribution final system test march finishing and films and financial systems replace manufacturing systems at five sites initial programming september north american office products remediate order processing  distribution and system implementation march financial systems european document finishing replace order processing  manufacturing  implemented of the december and office products distribution and financial systems locations gbc annual report management s discussion and analysis gbc and subsidiaries costs to address gbc s year issues the total cost of gbc s year projects is estimated to be approximately million a majority of the expenditures are in north america 
such costs include new software purchased and outside consultants hired to remediate non compliant systems 
gbc s estimated year costs do not include efforts to replace certain systems  as those projects were not accelerated to ensure year compliance  nor does gbc s estimate include the costs of company employees that may devote a portion of their efforts towards year remediation projects 
approximately of the costs directly related to remediation efforts were expensed in these costs have not had  nor are expected to have  a material effect on gbc s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any of the years in which spending has or will occur 
this expectation assumes that gbc will not be obligated to incur significant year related costs on behalf of its customers or suppliers 
the risks of gbc s year issues and contingency plans gbc believes that any year issues that could significantly impact its operations have been identified and those replacement or remediation efforts will be implemented on time 
gbc has prioritized its european implementation project focusing on early readiness for its most significant european operations 
gbc believes that non compliance of any european operation on january  will not cause any material disruption to its business or operations as a whole and that  in such event  contingency plans will have been implemented to bridge any period of non compliance 
gbc has not determined the most likely worst case scenarios related to year issues  but continues to monitor the projects in process and will develop contingency plans  if necessary  to ensure that it will be able to operate critical areas of the business 
euro on january   a majority of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro monetary as their new common legal currency 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and the participating countries own currencies legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that these legacy currencies will no longer be available after july  the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
gbc has assessed its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
gbc has also assessed its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro  and to accommodate the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies 
gbc s currency risk and risk management programs for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
gbc will continue to evaluate issues involving the introduction of the euro 
based on current information and gbc s current assessment  management does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on gbc s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
gbc annual report management s discussion and analysis gbc and subsidiaries new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and requires gbc to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting 
gbc will be required to implement sfas no 
for its fiscal year gbc does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its results of operations 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop provides guidance on the financial reporting on start up costs and organization costs 
it requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe that the adoption of sop will have a material effect on gbc s results of operations
