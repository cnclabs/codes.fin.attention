overview pacific gateway was founded in august to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in the international telecommunications services market 
the company operates an international network consisting of international and domestic switching facilities in the u 
s in new york  los angeles and dallas and offshore in the united kingdom  new zealand  russia and japan 
the company has partial ownership interests in digital undersea fiber optic cable systems in the atlantic  pacific and caribbean regions and operating agreements with foreign carriers that provide for the exchange of telecommunications traffic 
in  the company committed to invest in two significant undersea fiber optic cable construction projects the japan us cable network for million and the tat cable network for million  which will connect the united states with the uk  france  germany  the netherlands and denmark 
both cables are planned to be placed into operation in as of december   along with many varied options for termination  the company had operating agreements in countries around the world  which provide for the exchange of telecommunications traffic with these carriers 
the company has focused its efforts in towards expanding its operations offshore and diversifying its operations to provide value added services 
in  the company began operations in japan and began the licensing  construction and pre sales activities in offshore locations of germany  france and australia 
additional offshore locations are expected to be developed in to diversify its operations  the company has initiated ethnic marketing programs for the filipino and japanese ethnic markets to provide international long distance services 
the company expects to continue to diversify its markets and service offerings in the company s revenues are derived from three operating segments us wholesale  offshore and value added services 
the company s us wholesale segment provides international telecommunications services at low cost and high quality to its target base of usbased carriers that originate international traffic but do not have operating agreements with foreign carriers to terminate the traffic 
the us wholesale segment also provides service to us based international carriers  terminating their overflow telecommunications traffic or on routes with smaller traffic volumes 
the offshore segment consists primarily of traffic originated through the company s operations in the uk  germany  france  russia  japan  australia and new zealand 
the company is diversifying its operations to include a variety of emerging and value added services 
revenues generated by this operating segment are from providing international long distance services to certain ethnic retail markets  principally the filipino american and japanese american communities 
in the first quarter of  the company expanded its ethnic retail marketing to include the chinese and vietnamese communities 
the company plans to expand its ethnic marketing program to additional ethnic communities in the majority of the company s costs are variable and consist of payments to foreign partners for the termination of traffic  payments to other providers of long distance services for transmission services  payments to domestic carriers for the termination of overseas originated traffic in the united states where the company does not have its own domestic network and payments to local exchange companies for access charges for originating and terminating international and domestic traffic 
the company enters new markets by establishing operating agreements with foreign partners  by gaining termination arrangements with us carriers or those carriers in offshore markets who are able to terminate traffic on the company s behalf and through innovative termination arrangements 
the company seeks to have ownership positions in cable systems where it believes its customers demand will justify the investment in those fixed assets 
although the company is generally able to earn a higher gross margin on traffic routed through its owned circuits relative to leased routes  pacific gateway will continue to buy usage sensitive transmission capacity on a per minute basis from other us facilities based international carriers on routes where traffic volumes are relatively low or inconsistent  as well as to manage overflow traffic on busy routes 
under the fcc mandated operating agreement regime  the company traditionally agrees to send us originated traffic to its foreign partners and its foreign partners agree to send a proportionate amount of return traffic via the company s network at negotiated rates 
these agreements contractually obligate the foreign partners to adhere to the policy of the fcc  whereby traffic from the foreign country is routed to us based international carriers  such as the company  in the same proportion as traffic carried into the foreign country 
the company and its foreign partners typically settle the amounts owed to each other in cash on a net basis  subsequent to the receipt of return traffic 
the company records the amount due to the foreign partners as an expense in the period the company s traffic is delivered 
where the offshore markets have begun to liberalize  the company has experienced the traditional environment changing to a more cost based termination arrangement 
the following table sets forth income statement data as a percentage of revenues for the period indicated 
year ended december  revenues cost of long distance services gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income expense  net interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues in increased to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of growth in each of the company s three operating segments us wholesale  offshore and value added 
us wholesale revenues grew from million in to million in this growth is attributed to an increase in volume of traffic in the us market and an increase in number of us wholesale customers to at december  from at december  the company s offshore operations in the uk  russia  new zealand and japan generated million in revenue for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  offshore operations began in with customers at december  and grew to customers at december  value added services  which primarily provide international long distance services to certain ethnic markets  contributed million to revenue in compared to million in as a result of the growth in all three operating segments  total minutes increased from while the average price per minute charged to customers remained unchanged at cents 
during  the company experienced price declines in all operating segments  however  the company s average price per minute remained unchanged from because the company was able to expand its operations in the offshore markets and diversify its operations to include value added services  both of which generally offer higher prices 
the change in the terminating country mix with significantly different rates per minute  the reduction in the rates received for the traffic terminating in and transiting the united states and the increase in the incidental united states domestic terminating traffic are additional factors influencing the average price per minute 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in  primarily due to the expansion of operations to include additional offshore markets and the diversification of operations to include value added services 
the offshore and value added services segments contribute to gross margin by maintaining higher prices while utilizing the existing us wholesale low cost network and back office systems 
in addition  in the us wholesale segment  the company generally paid lower access rates to carriers terminating its traffic than it paid in the company continues to experience pressure on gross margin across all operating segments 
the company expects its expansion and diversification plans will offset this erosion over the long term 
the cost of long distance service increased to million for the year ended december  from million at december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in and the actual expenses increased to million from million 
this increase was due primarily to increased personnel as the number of employees at the company s wholly owned subsidiaries grew to from at december  in addition  the company incurred increased sales commission expenses payable to its joint venture  pintouch telecom  who markets the company s value added services to the filipino american ethnic market 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in representing of total revenues 
the increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to depreciation of the additional transmission facilities acquired in the us wholesale and offshore operating segments during interest income interest income increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the company having on average million in cash or cash equivalents during as compared to on average million in cash or cash equivalents during other income expense  net other income was million in compared to million in the increase is related to the equity in the earnings of the company s unconsolidated joint venture  pintouch telecom 
income tax income taxes increased to million from million  primarily due to increased operating income 
the effective tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  a portion of which are intended to be reinvested indefinitely in operations outside the us year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues in increased to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of an active us market and growth of the company s offshore sites in the uk  russia and new zealand 
sales to existing customers increased as the number of operating agreements grew to at december  from at december  the total number of customers worldwide increased to at december  from at december  as a result  total minutes increased from while the average price per minute charged to customers remained unchanged at cents 
during  prices generally declined in the markets in which the company principally operates and may decline further in the future 
however  the company s average price per minute remained unchanged from because the company was able to increase traffic to markets offering higher prices 
the change in the terminating country mix with significantly different rates per minute  the reduction in the rates received for the traffic terminating in and transiting the united states and the increase in the incidental united states domestic terminating traffic are factors influencing the average customer price per minute 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in  primarily because the company generally paid lower access rates to foreign carriers than it paid in and because in certain countries the competition for call termination has intensified and resulted in lower termination costs for pacific gateway and similar companies 
because the same rate is charged by the foreign carrier to terminate calls in its country as the company charges to terminate calls in the united states  declining rates have an adverse effect on revenue 
however  because the company sends more minutes to foreign partners than it receives from them  declining rates improve the company s gross margin received on its transactions with such foreign carriers 
gross margin was for the first half of and was for the second half of gross margin as a percentage of revenues was lower during the second half of primarily because the company s revenues increased significantly from million for the first half of to million for the second half of significant revenue increases generally reduce the company s short term gross margin for two reasons  which again took effect in the second half of first  to terminate the additional traffic efficiently  the company incurs the expense of building new facilities and reconfiguring its us network 
second  until this can be achieved  the company has no choice but to terminate the additional traffic over less efficient  higher cost routes 
the cost of long distance service increased to million for the year ended december  from million at december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in and the actual expenses increased to million from million 
this increase was due primarily to increased personnel as the number of employees at the company s wholly owned subsidiaries grew to and to at its majority owned russian subsidiary at december  from at december  in addition  the company incurred higher sales commission expenses due to increased revenues 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in  representing of total revenues 
the increase in the dollar amount was primarily due to depreciation of additional transmission facilities acquired during interest income interest income increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the company having on average million in cash or cash equivalents during as compared to on average million in cash or cash equivalents during income tax income taxes increased to million from million  primarily due to increased operating income 
the effective tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to earnings of certain non us subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its rapid growth  including its capital expenditures  through funds provided by operations and the funds from the public offering completed in the third quarter of due to the timing differences in the international settlements  the company s accounts receivable turnover varies from its accounts payable turnover 
the length of these turnovers is a function of different timing requirements in the company s agreements with foreign partners 
for example  the length of the company s accounts payable turnover is partially due to its accounts payable with foreign partners  which generally have day terms as a result of the six month lag in the international settlement process 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in and million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was caused by cash outflows for payments of accounts payable  which were greater due to the relative shortening of the payment process and income taxes payable 
this decrease was partially offset by greater cash generating net income 
the increase from to was primarily a result of an increase in net income and accounts payable  which were greater than the increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities increased to million in  from million in and million in the expenditures were primarily for additional transmission equipment for the us wholesale domestic switches in new york and los angeles as well as for the acquisition of partial ownership interests in international fiber optic cable transmission systems 
capital expenditures in and were also for the acquisition of ownership interests in international fiber optic cable transmission systems and related equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an uncollateralized year revolving line of credit of up to million with bank of america  nt sa and nationsbanc montgomery llc facility and borrowed million pursuant to this line of credit 
the proceeds were used to fund outstanding cable commitments 
during the third quarter of  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which provided the company with net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments of million for the acquisition of additional ownership in digital undersea fiber optic cables and network equipment 
this includes the commitment to purchase undersea fiber optic cables in the japan us cable network for million and in the tat cable system for million 
the company has used its revolving line of credit to fund its first installment payments for these cable systems 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pacific gateway exchange bermuda limited  obtained a commitment letter from salomon brothers holding company  inc and goldman sachs credit partners lp for a million credit facility  with the ability to layer an additional million of bank debt 
this facility is expected to replace the facility 
the proceeds will be used to fund the million in cable commitments as well as additional global network expansion and general corporate purposes 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  existing lines of credit and debt commitments will be sufficient to meet its outstanding capital commitments  current capital expenditures and working capital needs for its expected growth in year issue the year issue affects the computer systems  network elements  software applications and other business systems that have time sensitive programs that may not properly reflect or recognize the year because many computers and computer applications define dates by the last two digits of the year  may not be properly identified as the year this error could result in miscalculations or system failures 
the company has identified its year risk in three categories internal information systems  other internal systems  and external vendor and customer systems 
internal information systems 
the company s internal information systems were initially designed to be year ready 
these systems  such as the company s billing system  have been tested in a simulated year environment and were preliminarily determined to be year ready 
additional tests will be conducted for final determination of year readiness by april  the costs associated with testing year readiness are not expected to be material to the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
other internal systems 
the company has assessed the impact of the year on its other internal systems  primarily its telecommunications switching equipment in the us in dallas  los angeles and new york and offshore in the uk  new zealand  russia and japan  and has conducted tests on such systems 
software and hardware upgrades have been ordered for all switching equipment that was found to be non compliant and is expected to be in place and fully functional by april  the costs associated with testing and upgrading equipment to ensure year readiness are not expected to be material to the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is in the process of identifying and evaluating other operational systems and applications  which we believe are not mission critical  such as building operations and individual personal computers used by the company personnel 
vendor and customer systems 
the company has sent letters and questionnaires to its significant vendors and customers requesting a response from those third parties on their year readiness with respect to information systems used by those entities which could impact business with the company 
to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company intends to identify alternative and or new vendors and customers who have demonstrated year readiness 
we are still awaiting responses from our most significant vendors and customers 
there is no assurance  however  that full year readiness will be achieved by such third parties or that the company will receive assurances from such third parties 
in the event that any of the company s significant vendors and customers do not successfully and timely achieve year readiness  and the company is unable to replace them with new and or alternative vendors and customers  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
as part of the company s year risk program  the company is evaluating scenarios that may occur as a result of the century change and anticipates completing contingency and business continuity plans targeted at mitigating the effects of any significant year noncompliance by mid quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth statement of operations data for each of the company s last eight calendar quarters and the percentage of the company s revenues represented by each line item reflected therein 
this information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained herein and  in management s opinion  reflects all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented
