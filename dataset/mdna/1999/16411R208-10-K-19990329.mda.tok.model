management s plans and continued capital raising activities the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
cheniere is a development stage company which has not yet generated any operating revenues 
at various times during the life of the company to date  it has been necessary for the company to raise additional capital through private placements of debt or equity financing 
when such a need has arisen  the company has met it successfully 
it is management s belief that it will continue to be able to meet its needs for additional capital as such needs arise in the future 
at december   the company had  outstanding in senior term notes payable which matured on january  these notes were issued as part of a bridge financing in conjunction with an offering of units comprised of preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
the units offering was subsequently withdrawn 
the company has issued  shares of common stock in exchange for notes totaling  the remaining notes have been extended and mature on april  cheniere intends to raise additional capital for the repayment of the notes through the sale of common stock 
in the event that the company should not be successful in future efforts to raise capital for its operations  management believes that trades or sales of partial interests to industry partners would be utilized to explore and develop the company s oil and gas properties  but the ownership interest which would be retained by the company would be reduced accordingly
