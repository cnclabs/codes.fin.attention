the increase in clinical sales was primarily the result of having a full year of selling the fda approved aneuvysion tm assay 
the increase in research products was partially due to approximately million of sales attributable to receiving oncor  inc s oncor non oncology fluorescence in situ hybridization fish business as part of a settlement agreement ending a patent infringement suit brought by the company  as exclusive licensee  and its licensor against oncor  inc the decrease in instrument sales  which consists primarily of cytogenetic imaging equipment including software  was the result of a general decline in overall market demand 
the company expects the current market environment of reduced demand for cytogenetic imaging equipment to continue through for the year ended december   grant and other revenue decreased million  or percent  primarily due to the completion in of two united states department of commerce research grants that resulted in a million decrease in as compared to  offset by million of nonrecurring license and other revenues related to the previously mentioned settlement agreement with oncor

income taxes prior to the completion of the company s ipo  the results of operations were included in the consolidated income tax returns of bp amoco  accordingly  the domestic net operating losses through february  have been utilized by bp amoco in its consolidated income tax returns and are not available to offset the company s future taxable income 
subsequent to the ipo  the company will file a separate federal income tax return 
as the company was in a loss position for the period february  through december   no federal provision is recorded 
for state income taxes  the company s results of operations will continue to be included with bp amoco due to their percent ownership interest in the company in those states where required by state tax law 
under state tax laws in a number of states  including illinois the state in which much of the company s business is taxed  the company is required by law to be included in bp amoco s unitary state tax returns as long as bp amoco owns or controls percent or more of the voting equity 
for unitary state filings  the tax sharing agreement with bp amoco requires bp amoco to pay the company the incremental tax savings  if any  received by bp amoco as a result of including the company s results of operations in such filings

cash used in operating activities primarily relates to ongoing operating losses as previously discussed above 
net cash used in provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities of million as compared to resulted primarily from the purchase of short term investments  net of proceeds from maturities  as a result of investing a portion of the proceeds from the offering 
the increase in cash used in investing activities of million as compared to was primarily attributable to the sale of two facilities in framingham  massachusetts during for million partially offset by a million decrease in other asset expenditures 
net cash flows provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million primarily resulted from the receipt of million in net proceeds from the offering and million of long term debt  net of repayments  partially offset by the reduced borrowings from bp amoco 
such borrowings from bp amoco ceased february   upon the completion of the offering at which time the remaining million note balance was repaid 
prior to the offering  the company financed its operations primarily through loans and capital contributions and expenses funded by bp amoco 
the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company has entered into various license agreements pursuant to which it has been granted use of certain patented technologies 
the agreements require the company to pay royalties ranging from percent to percent on net sales of specified products  with certain minimum royalties due each year 
as additional consideration for certain of the licenses  the company is obligated to fund certain research of the licensors 
future minimum amounts due under all such agreements range from million to million per year for through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
since its inception  the company has experienced negative cash flows from operations 
in order to preserve the company s cash position and to reduce cash used in operating activities  the company s board of directors approved during march a restructuring plan that has resulted in the elimination of positions in the us  representing a percent reduction of the us work force  thereby reducing ongoing annual cash expenditures by an estimated million 
the company expects to record a charge for severance costs of approximately million during the first quarter of the company believes that its current cash and short term investment position  and the interest to be earned thereon  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations into the company s estimate of the time period for which cash funds will be adequate to fund its operations is a forward looking estimate subject to risks and uncertainty  and actual results may differ materially 
the company s requirements for additional capital will depend on many factors  including growth in product revenues  payments received under existing and potential collaborative agreements  the availability of government research grant payments  the progress of the company s collaborative and independent research and development projects  the costs of preclinical and clinical trials for the company s products  the prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities 
to the extent capital resources  including payments from existing and possible future collaborative agreements and grants  together with the net proceeds of the ipo are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  the company will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of its technologies 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements on unattractive terms 
the company s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  it establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company anticipates that  due to its current non use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
readiness for the year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as the year approaches  these code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with 
as a result  computer systems and or software products used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company is in the process of evaluating the year readiness of the software products sold by the company products  the information technology systems used in its operations it systems  and its non it systems  such as manufacturing facility related equipment and other systems that could impact the operations of the company 
the company currently anticipates that this project will consist of the following phases i identification of all products  it systems  and non it systems  ii assessment of repair or replacement requirements  iii repair or replacement  iv testing where necessary  v implementation  and vi creation of contingency plans in the event of year failures 
the company completed the review of all current versions of its products and believes that all products are year compliant 
with respect to it systems  the company has developed a plan to make its systems year compliant and has begun implementation of the plan during the first quarter of the company s current it systems related to manufacturing are already year compliant 
to implement the other it systems modules for year compliance requires an upgrade to a more current version of the existing software  which was supplied to the company at no charge 
however  the company has elected to use this opportunity to upgrade all modules to the most current version offered by the software vendor 
the company currently expects this project to be substantially complete by the third quarter of once installed and operational  the company will assess the need to develop contingency plans related to these it systems 
the company does not expect this project to have a significant impact on its information technology it budget or other non related it projects  as discussed below 
the company will continue to implement it systems with strategic value and has started to implement a new european management information system which is expected to also be completed in in the area of non it systems  the company relies  both domestically and internationally  upon various vendors  government agencies  research institutions  utility companies  telecommunications service companies  delivery service companies  and other material and service providers who are outside of the company s control 
there is no assurance that such parties will not suffer a year business disruption  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant vendors and customers to determine the extent of which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company is requesting that third party vendors represent their products and services to be year compliant and that they have a program to test for year compliance 
however  the response of those third parties is beyond the company s control 
to the extent that the company does not receive adequate responses by early  it is prepared to develop contingency plans  with completion of these plans scheduled for no later than mid at this time  the company cannot estimate the additional cost  if any  that might develop from such contingency plans 
with respect to the manufacturing facility related equipment and other systems  the company is in the process of assessing these systems for year compliance 
to date  the company has not incurred any significant expenditures in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
most of its expenses have related to the opportunity cost of time spent by employees of the company evaluating its products  it systems  non it systems  and general year compliance matters 
absent a significant year compliance deficiency  the company currently estimates that the cost to complete its year compliance programs  including updating its it system modules to the most current version available  will be less than  of expense and  of capitalized costs 
breakdowns in the company s it systems and non it systems  such as its manufacturing application software and the computer chips embedded in its plant equipment  as well as other year related problems such as disruptions in the delivery of materials  power  heat or water to the company s facilities  could prevent the company from being able to manufacture and ship its products 
if the company were to fail to correct a material year problem  its normal business activities and operations could be interrupted 
such interruptions could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exchange rate risk is limited to its operations in england  germany  france and italy 
the exchange rate risk is mitigated through local purchases for the majority of their expenditures 
the company s primary foreign currency exchange rate risk results from the foreign operations intercompany purchases of clinical and research products as well as certain instrument system components 
the majority of the intercompany purchases are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future as these operations have required more working capital as a result of their significant growth 
sales throughout the rest of the world are denoted in us dollars 
the company does not believe that the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have a material impact on its financial statements 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was immaterial for the years ended december   and the foreign currency translation loss included in shareholders equity resulting from the translation of the financial statements of the company s international subsidiaries into us dollars decreased by million in due to the weakening of the us dollar against the functional currency of the company s international subsidiaries 
interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the million of short term investments owned by the company 
such securities are debt instruments which generate interest income for the company on excess cash balances 
the company does not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term  less than months  nature of these investments 
the company does not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on its business
