item business overview symphonix devices  inc symphonix or the company is a developer of proprietary semi implantable and implantable products  or soundbridges  for the management of moderate to severe hearing impairment 
in  mild to severe hearing impairment affected approximately million people in the united states  or of the population  of whom approximately million people were classified as moderately or severely hearing impaired 
the company believes that its family of vibrant soundbridges  designed to overcome the inherent limitations of traditional hearing devices  represent a novel approach in the management of hearing impairment 
the company s initial products  the vibrant p  vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges  are semi implantable devices which mechanically drive the three small bones of the middle ear to overcome the user s hearing impairment 
the vibrant p soundbridge is a second generation product that is similar to the first generation vibrant soundbridge but is designed to permit a greater degree of customization to address the specific needs of a particular user s hearing loss and expand the types of hearing loss that can be managed by the company s products 
the vibrant hf soundbridge is designed for people with a noise induced high frequency hearing loss and the vibrant d soundbridge incorporates digital signal processing 
in september  the company initiated clinical trials of the first generation vibrant soundbridge in both the united states and europe 
the company initiated clinical trials of the vibrant p soundbridge in europe in july and in the united states in march in november  the company initiated clinical trials of the vibrant hf soundbridge in both europe and the united states 
the company has received permission to affix the ce mark in the european union to the vibrant p and vibrant hf soundbridges  and began selling activities for the vibrant p soundbridge in march the company plans to commence selling activities for the vibrant hf soundbridge in europe after it has gathered clinical data on a limited number of patients 
as of january   approximately patients have been implanted with the company s soundbridges 
the hearing impairment market background the human ear consists of three regions the outer ear  the middle ear and the inner ear 
the outer ear consists of the external auricle and the ear canal 
the ear canal is a passageway through which sound waves reach the middle ear 
the outer ear is separated from the middle ear by the tympanic membrane  commonly referred to as the eardrum 
the middle ear is a chamber that contains three tiny bones  the malleus  the incus  and the stapes  that together are known as the ossicles 
the ossicles form a chain from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear 
the inner ear includes the cochlea  which is a fluid filled structure that contains a large number of delicate sensory hair cells that are connected to the auditory nerve 
sound  which is a wave like vibration of the air  enters the ear canal and is slightly amplified by the natural resonant characteristics of the ear canal 
these sound waves cause vibration of the tympanic membrane and are amplified and transmitted to the fluid filling the inner ear by the motion of the ossicles 
the waves created in the fluid pass through the snail shaped cochlea and stimulate the delicate sensory hair cells 
these hair cells generate electrochemical signals that are detected by the auditory nerve and are then subsequently interpreted by the brain as sound 
the signals that are interpreted by the brain as sound are distinguished by frequency and intensity 
the frequency of sound is perceived as pitch and is measured in cycles per second  or hertz hz 
the normal human ear perceives sounds in the range of to  hz  although most components of human speech are generally in the range of to  hz 
a more subtle aspect of frequency is that certain letters of the alphabet are spoken at a different frequency than others 
for example  certain consonants such as m  n and g and all vowels are spoken at relatively low frequencies while other consonants and sounds such as t  s  f and sch are spoken at higher frequencies 
accordingly  at a given volume  certain letters may be more audible than others 
the intensity of sound is perceived as loudness and is measured in decibels db 
the lowest level of intensity at which an individual perceives sound is known as the threshold of hearing 
the range in decibels from a person s threshold of hearing to the level at which the person perceives sound to be uncomfortably loud is known as the dynamic range 
both the threshold of hearing and the dynamic range vary with the frequency of sound 
an individual with normal hearing can comfortably hear sounds ranging in intensity from approximately db to db

hearing impairment hearing impairment can adversely effect a person s quality of life and psychological well being 
hearing impaired people often withdraw from discussions and other social interactions to avoid frustration and embarrassment from not being able to fully participate in and understand conversations 
difficulty in communicating effectively can lead to negative emotions and attitudes  increased stress levels and reduced self confidence  sociability and effectiveness in the workplace 
in addition  recent studies suggest that hearing impairment may be linked to physiological complications  such as heart disease 
audiologists typically classify the hearing impaired population into four categories mild  moderate  severe and profound 
in  the total hearing impaired population in the united states was approximately million people  of whom approximately million were classified as either moderately or severely hearing impaired 
while the exact causes of hearing impairment are varied and unclear  hearing impairment can be characterized according to its physiological source 
there are two general categories of hearing impairment  conductive and sensorineural  although sometimes a combination of the two may arise 
conductive hearing impairment results from diseases or disorders that limit the transmission of sound through the outer and or middle ear 
conductive hearing impairment is often treated surgically with an implanted prosthesis to replace part or all of the ossicles 
the company believes that people with a conductive hearing loss represent a small portion of the total hearing impaired population 
sensorineural hearing impairment occurs in the inner ear and or neural pathways and  the company believes  accounts for the vast majority of hearing impairment 
in patients with sensorineural hearing impairment  the external and middle ear function normally 
the sound vibrations pass undisturbed through the eardrum and ossicles  and fluid waves are created in the cochlea 
however  because some or many of the delicate sensory hair cells inside the cochlea have degenerated or been damaged  the inner ear cannot detect the full intensity and quality of the sound 
sensorineural hearing impairment typically occurs as a result of aging or exposure to loud noise over a protracted period of time 
as people age  their level of hearing deteriorates and the dynamic range of audible frequencies is compressed  especially at the higher frequencies 
while approximately of the united states population is hearing impaired  based on data  this percentage increases to an average of approximately for individuals over years of age 
the company believes that with the growth and aging of the population  the hearing impaired population will continue to increase throughout the industrialized world 
with the increasing exposure to noise in modern society  it has been observed that people may experience noise induced hearing loss from aircraft  automobiles  lawn mowers and high powered stereo equipment as well as military service and machinery within the workplace 
existing therapies the traditional approaches to management of sensorineural hearing impairment have been the use of hearing aids and cochlear implants 
hearing aids are the most common devices used to manage mild to severe sensorineural hearing impairment 
cochlear implants have been used for the narrow segment of the sensorineural market represented by profound hearing impairment 
however  both approaches have significant limitations in addressing their respective markets 
hearing aids 
the following table  based upon and articles in the hearing journal  illustrates the ownership of traditional hearing aids by the hearing impaired population in approximately of the hearing aid owners did not use their device 
type of hearing impaired hearing aid market hearing population owners penetration of impairment millions millions hearing aids mild moderate severe profound total hearing aids are acoustic drive devices that amplify sound to increase the movement of the tympanic pmembrane and thereby indirectly vibrate the ossicles in an attempt to overcome the decrease in sensitivity of the delicate sensory hair cells inside the cochlea 
the first electrically enhanced hearing aid was invented about a hundred years ago and consisted of a microphone  amplifier  battery and speaker 
more recently  hearing aid manufacturers have increased the sophistication of sound processing  often using digital technology  to provide features such as programmability and multi band compression  allowing different degrees of amplification at different frequencies 
hand held programmers have also been developed to compensate for the inability of hearing aids to adequately process sound in a variety of acoustic environments 
in addition  as technology has enabled greater miniaturization  less obtrusive hearing aids have become available 
although there have been continued advancements in hearing aid device technology  for optimal performance all or part of the device must fit tightly in the ear canal  which results in significant drawbacks  including the following distorted sound quality 
obstructing the ear canal with either all or part of the hearing aid creates an effect known as occlusion  where outside sounds such as music are overwhelmed by internal sounds such as breathing or talking 
because the ear canal s natural resonance is significantly altered  the resulting sound can be unnatural and highly distorted 
acoustic feedback 
feedback is a high pitched squeal which results when a speaker and microphone are placed in close proximity and the sound from the speaker is loud enough to be picked up by the microphone 
the problem of feedback is magnified since the volume of these devices must be turned up to not only compensate for the patient s hearing impairment but to overcome the reduction in sound caused by the blockage of the ear canal by the hearing aid 
in addition  as hearing aids have been manufactured in smaller configurations  the problem of feedback has become inherently greater due to the closer proximity of the speaker to the microphone 
poor localization 
occlusion also results in the inability to differentiate the direction of sounds  as well as the inability to adequately differentiate between background noise and more important sounds  such as conversation 
social stigma 
many hearing aid users and potential users perceive a strong social stigma related to wearing a hearing aid 
discomfort 
hearing aids have been manufactured in smaller configurations in an attempt to address the perceived social stigma associated with wearing these devices 
since a tight fitting ear piece is required for optimal performance  the smaller versions of these devices must be placed deeper in the ear canal  which can cause substantial discomfort 
reliability 
hearing aids require frequent maintenance  in part due to their placement in the ear canal  where ear wax can cause problems with the speaker or dampen the sound produced by the hearing aid 
hearing aids generally have to be replaced every three or four years  either because of loss  damage or obsolescence 
the need for periodic replacement increases the lifetime cost of wearing a hearing aid 
traditionally  most hearing aid users have paid for these devices directly 
as a result of these problems  the benefits perceived by hearing aid users are generally very low 
an article in the hearing journal reported that only approximately of all hearing aid users are satisfied 
reflecting this low level of user satisfaction  in hearing aid manufacturers experienced product return rates ranging from to 
despite the inherent limitations of hearing aids  in  approximately million hearing aids were sold in the united states  representing a retail market of approximately billion 
the united states market represents approximately of the worldwide hearing aid market 
the company estimates that the worldwide retail market for hearing aids exceeded billion in cochlear implants 
cochlear implants were originally developed for people who have a profound hearing loss and are essentially deaf 
the cochlear implant is inserted into the inner ear in a highly invasive and non reversible surgery  that destroys residual hearing 
the implant electrically stimulates the auditory nerve through an electrode array that provides audible cues to the user which are not interpreted by the brain as normal sound 
users generally require intensive and extended counseling  speech therapy  and training following surgery to be able to properly interpret these cues and achieve any benefit 
best results are achieved with adults whose hearing loss develops later in life or with children 
recently  some cochlear implants have been indicated for severe hearing loss 
however  cochlear implants have been controversial both because of strong resistance from portions of the deaf community and because of the irreversible nature of the surgery in which the cochlea is invaded and any residual hearing is destroyed 
accordingly  the company does not believe that cochlear implants will achieve significant market penetration beyond their initial indication of profound hearing impairment 
the company estimates that  in  the worldwide market for cochlear implants was under million 
the symphonix solution the company is developing a family of proprietary semi implantable and implantable products  or soundbridges  for the management of moderate to severe hearing impairment 
the company s family of vibrant soundbridges is based on its patented core technology  the floating mass transducer fmt 
the fmt is a tiny transducer that is designed to enhance hearing by precisely mimicking and amplifying the movements of the ossicles by converting sound into mechanical vibrations 
while conventional approaches have indirectly driven the ossicles by amplifying sound to increase the vibrations of the tympanic membrane  the fmt is attached directly to the ossicles and enhances the natural movement of these vibratory structures 
this in turn generates enhanced stimulation of the delicate sensory hair cells in the inner ear 
the fmt receives electrical signals from an audio processor  which picks up sound from the environment and converts these sounds into electrical signals 
the audio processor transmits the signals to an implant under the skin 
as a result  the ear canal is not obstructed  the natural resonance of the ear is maintained and an amplified  natural sound quality is achieved 
the company s soundbridges are implanted in a two hour surgery that can be performed on an outpatient basis utilizing the techniques which are similar to those employed in routine otologic procedures 
based on preclinical studies  the company believes that the surgical procedure can be reversed without clinically meaningful damage to the patient s residual hearing 
the company believes that its family of vibrant soundbridges offers a number of significant benefits  including improved sound quality and speech intelligibility 
by leaving the ear canal unobstructed and the natural resonance undisturbed  a more natural sound quality is obtained over a broader range of frequencies  and the user s ability to understand speech is expected to be greater 
elimination of acoustic feedback 
since the vibrant soundbridge mechanically drives the ossicles  it does not generate any acoustic feedback 
improved sound localization 
users are able to comprehend the acoustic sound environment  identify specific sounds and their source and differentiate sounds from background noise 
minimized social stigma 
in the semi implantable versions of the company s soundbridges  the only external component is located behind the ear and generally hidden by the user s hair 
as a result  social stigma is minimized 
the totally implantable versions of the company s soundbridges are being designed with no external components  and aesthetic considerations would be completely eliminated 
improved comfort 
no part of the vibrant soundbridge is inserted in the ear canal  resulting in increased comfort for users of the vibrant soundbridge 
improved reliability 
since no components of the vibrant soundbridge are in the ear canal  the reliability problems caused by wax and moisture are eliminated 
strategy the company s objectives are to establish its family of vibrant soundbridges as the standard of care worldwide for the management of moderate to severe hearing impairment and to establish symphonix as the leading company in the hearing management market 
the following are key elements of the company s strategy demonstrate improved quality of life 
the company intends to promote the potential benefits of its products to the hearing impaired population in order to expand the market to include not only current dissatisfied hearing aid users but also former users who have abandoned hearing aids due to either previous dissatisfaction or perceived social stigma 
the company believes that achieving real patient benefit in the form of improved quality of life will be an important factor in differentiating its products from the traditional approaches to hearing management 
develop surgeon and audiologist endorsement of the company s family of soundbridges 
the company intends to position its family of vibrant soundbridges as technologically advanced implants that address an unmet patient need and add to the products and services that surgeons can offer 
the company s strategy is to market its soundbridges initially to those specialists in otology who are currently most active in ear surgery and  thereafter  to the general population of ent surgeons 
because the surgical procedure for implementing the vibrant soundbridge utilizes many of the same techniques employed by surgeons trained and experienced in cochlear implant surgery  the company believes that surgeon training will not be a significant impediment to market acceptance 
an additional element of the company s strategy is to build awareness among audiologists of the company s soundbridges to encourage the referral of patients to surgeons 
leverage the company s patented core technology 
the company intends to leverage its patented core fmt technology to develop new soundbridges and enhancements to its current technology 
the company intends to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development to further develop its technology base and to expand the market it addresses through development of a family of alternate configurations of soundbridges 
the company has developed the vibrant p soundbridge to permit a degree of customization to address the specific needs of a particular patient  and is developing the vibrant d soundbridge to permit an even greater degree of customization along with the additional benefit of digital signal processing  and the vibrant hf soundbridge to provide a benefit suited to those individuals who have a noise induced hearing loss at high frequencies but relatively normal hearing at lower frequencies 
protect and enhance the company s proprietary position 
the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue proprietary protection for its technologies and products 
the company has patents issued in the united states  one patent issued internationally and patents pending both in the united states and internationally covering a number of fundamental aspects of the fmt and related technologies 
products under development symphonix is developing proprietary semi implantable and implantable soundbridges  utilizing the company s core fmt technology to manage hearing impairment 
the company believes that the vibrant p  vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges will enable the company to address a significant portion of the moderate to severe hearing impairment market currently not satisfied with traditional hearing aid devices 
in addition  the company is developing the vibrant ti soundbridge which is being designed to be totally implantable with no external components 
the vibrant p  vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges utilize the same implant  with the differences in function being provided by modifications to the external audio processor  its software and programming unit 
utilization of a common implant will allow a user to upgrade the audio processor if a user s hearing changes over time 
the following table sets forth the soundbridges under development by the company and their development status soundbridge description hearing loss status addressed vibrant p second generation semi moderate to pivotal trial enrollment implantable hearing device with severe completed in the united states  programmable dual band analog product sales in europe signal processing 
vibrant hf second generation semi implantable noise pivotal trial approved in the hearing device designed to address induced high united states and enrollment noise induced high frequency frequency under way  gathering clinical hearing loss by using modified loss data in a limited number of signal processing

vibrant xp second generation semi implantable severe to early stage of development hearing device designed to address profound more severe hearing impairment by using modified signal processing and an externally worn battery pack  coupled with a modified implant 
vibrant ti designed to be totally implantable moderate to in development with no external components 
severe regulatory filing dates reflect the company s plans and are subject to delay or cancellation depending upon contingencies that may arise in the development process 
the company s vibrant p  vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges  have both external and implantable components 
the external audio processor consists of i a microphone that picks up sound from the environment  ii sound processing circuitry that converts the sound to an electronic signal and modulates the signal to reduce potential noise interference from broad band electromagnetic fields and iii a small volt battery that powers the device 
the audio processor is placed on the skull behind the ear and is held in place by magnetic attraction to an implanted receiver  the vorp vibrating ossicular prosthesis 
the audio processor is small enough to be concealed by the user s hair 

illustration of vibrant soundbridge in place 
the vorp converts the electronic signal to a mechanical vibration of the ossicles in the middle ear 
the vorp consists of i a receiver unit that receives the electromagnetic signal through the skin from the external audio processor and breaks down the electrical signal to the appropriate drive signal for the fmt  ii a conductor link that connects the implanted receiver unit to the fmt and iii the fmt itself  which is attached to the incus using a titanium clip 
all of these components are insulated from body chemistry using well established implantable device materials used in pacemaker and implantable defibrillator systems 
the fmt is a tiny transducer  smaller than a grain of rice  that comprises a floating magnet contained within a titanium housing 
a coil surrounding the housing generates a small electromagnetic field based on a signal received from the vorp s receiver unit 
the electromagnetic interaction of the magnet and the coil creates a mechanical vibration of the entire fmt 
this vibration enhances the natural movement of the ossicles  which in turn generates enhanced stimulation of the delicate sensory hair cells in the inner ear 
a critical element of the proprietary fmt design is the proximity of the magnet to the electromagnetic field that causes the magnet to vibrate 
by keeping the magnet and the coil close together  the fmt maximizes electromagnetic coupling while minimizing power consumption 

logo of product illustration 
the surgical procedure for the implantation of the vibrant soundbridges involves techniques which are similar to those employed in other common otologic procedures 
the internal receiver unit is implanted below the skin and muscle behind the ear 
the conductor link connecting the receiver unit to the fmt is placed through the excavated mastoid bone 
these steps are similar to those required for the surgical placement of a cochlear implant receiver 
in the middle ear  the fmt is attached to the ossicles in a manner similar to the way otologists have traditionally attached ossicular prostheses for management of conductive hearing loss 
because the surgery involves surgical techniques that are familiar to ear surgeons  the company believes that surgeon training will not be a significant impediment to market acceptance 
the procedure may be performed on an outpatient basis  and generally can be performed in about two hours 
approximately eight weeks following the surgery  the audio processor is fitted by an audiologist with the appropriate sound processing settings 
the company s approved investigational device exemption ide only permits implantation in one ear 
this will generally be the ear with the poorest unaided functional hearing 
based on preclinical studies  the company believes that the surgical procedure can be reversed without damage to the patient s residual hearing 
vibrant p soundbridge the vibrant p soundbridge is designed to permit  through programming  a degree of customization to address the specific needs of a particular user s hearing loss  thereby permitting a broad range of types of hearing loss to be managed 
at the time of fitting  the audio processor is connected to a hand held programming unit which allows the audiologist to adjust separately the low and high frequencies 
this permits customization to the patient s needs in either the high or low frequency band 
the company received approval to affix the ce mark to the vibrant p soundbridge in march and commenced selling activities in the european union at that time 
the vibrant p soundbridge has superceded the company s first generation vibrant soundbridge 
in the united states  the company has completed enrollment in the pivotal phase of a us food and administration fda approved multi center study 
during the year ended december   the company was selected by the fda to participate in the new  streamlined pre market approval pma process called the modular pma 
under the modular pma process  modules reflecting the content requirements of a traditional pma are submitted as they are completed  allowing them to be reviewed and approved in a sequential manner 
to date  the company has submitted four modules of its pma for the vibrant p soundbridge 
there can be no assurance that the company s participation in the modular pma program will lead to the timely approval of the vibrant p soundbridge  if at all 
vibrant hf soundbridge the vibrant hf soundbridge is being developed to provide a benefit for those individuals who have a hearing loss at high frequencies but relatively normal hearing at lower frequencies 
hearing aids usually are limited in effectiveness at higher frequencies due to acoustic feedback and internal speaker response 
with the increasing exposure to noise in modern society  it has been observed that people may experience noise induced hearing loss from aircraft  automobiles  lawn mowers and high powered stereo equipment as well as military service and machinery within the workplace 
the vibrant hf soundbridge will be configured through selective signal processing 
the company received permission to affix the ce mark to the vibrant hf soundbridge in july the company is gathering clinical data on the vibrant hf soundbridge on a limited number of patients in europe prior to initiating full scale commercial selling activities 
in the united states  the company has received approval of an ide supplement to include the vibrant hf soundbridge in its existing pivotal trial of the vibrant p soundbridge 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not be required to submit a separate pma for the vibrant hf soundbridge 
vibrant d soundbridge the vibrant d soundbridge under development is similar to the vibrant p soundbridge  but is designed to permit an even greater degree of customization to address the specific needs of a particular user s hearing loss  through digital signal processing 
fully automatic and independent sound processing in three separate frequency bands is provided 
at the time of fitting  the audio processor is connected to a programming unit which allows the audiologist to adjust separately the low  mid and high frequencies 
this sophisticated system will be capable of analyzing sound and automatically adjusting the soundbridge s response 
the company intends to seek approval of an ide supplement for the vibrant d soundbridge during and also to initiate a limited clinical trial in there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not be required to submit a separate ide and pma for the vibrant d soundbridge 
vibrant xp soundbridge the vibrant xp soundbridge is intended to provide a benefit for those individuals who have a severe to profound hearing loss with a high level of speech recognition 
currently  there are only limited treatment options for such individuals 
the vibrant xp soundbridge will be configured to provide modified signal processing and higher output from the fmt  thereby providing additional benefit for certain people with a severe to profound hearing impairment 
generating this higher output will require an external body worn battery pack  similar to those used for cochlear implants 
however  unlike cochlear implants  the vibrant xp soundbridge will not require penetration of the inner ear with its attendant damage to residual hearing 
the company is evaluating alternative technical approaches and may conduct a feasibility study in on a limited number of patients in europe to assess the viability of this product concept 
vibrant ti soundbridge the company is developing versions of the vibrant soundbridge for the management of moderate to severe hearing impairment that are totally implantable with no external components 
the essential function of the fmt for these products will be the same as in the semi implantable products 
however  all the functions currently performed by the external audio processor are being designed to be performed by implanted components 
the company believes that the vibrant ti soundbridge  if successfully developed  will be applicable especially for people who are particularly physically active or who are concerned about aesthetics 
three critical elements of producing the vibrant ti soundbridge are the development of an implantable microphone that can adequately pick up sound from the external environment  the development of a transcutaneously rechargeable battery to power the device and the design of the signal processing chip set 
the microphone is being developed internally by the company and the battery is being developed under a cooperative development project with a specialized battery manufacturer 
additionally  the company has initiated the development  using third party contractors  of the electronic chip set that will provide the signal processing electronics for the vibrant ti soundbridge 
however  there can be no assurance that such components will be successfully developed in a timely manner  if at all 
although the company has commenced selling the vibrant p soundbridge in the european union  all of the company s other products are in development  and accordingly  significant revenues from product sales will not be realized for at least several years  if ever 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s product development efforts will be successfully completed  that any of the company s products will be proven to be safe and effective  that regulatory approvals will be obtained or labeling claims will be as broad as sought  that the company s products will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities with acceptable yields at reasonable costs  or that any products  if introduced  will achieve market acceptance 
clinical trial activities united states on february   the company received approval of an ide for the vibrant soundbridge from the fda 
the vibrant was the company s first generation semi implantable hearing device 
the company completed a phase i trial under the ide and submitted the interim report to the fda 
this trial was limited to five subjects  including geoffrey r 
ball  a founder of the company  at two investigational sites and was intended to test the safety and provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of the device and the surgical procedures used to implant the device 
due to the limited number of subjects evaluated  no statistically valid conclusions could be made from the results reported to the fda 
in the phase i study  the company observed the following performance characteristics increased functional gain at higher frequencies ie  hz  elimination of occlusion effect  elimination of acoustic feedback  elimination of placement loss  and reduction of maintenance issues 
a self assessment questionnaire targeted seven communicative issues ie  reverberation  familiar talker  reduced cues  background noise  aversion to sounds  ease of communication  and distortion of sounds 
subject responses indicated a significant improvement in six of the seven categories with the vibrant soundbridge when compared to their current acoustic hearing aid 
in november  the company filed an ide supplement summarizing the phase i results  finalizing the study protocol and proposed labeling claims  providing technical information regarding the vibrant p soundbridge  the company s second generation semi implantable device  and requested permission to proceed to the pivotal study 
in december  the fda approved the multi center pivotal study in subjects at up to sites with the vibrant p soundbridge 
in november the company received fda approval of an ide supplement to include the vibrant hf soundbridge in this study 
the company has enrolled subjects in the study 
however  because the ide supplement allowing the inclusion of the vibrant hf soundbridge was approved when enrollment was almost complete  only one of the subjects is to be fitted with a vibrant hf soundbridge 
to facilitate enrollment of a greater number of subjects who receive the vibrant hf soundbridge  on december   the company requested fda approval of an ide supplement to allow an additional subjects 
this ide supplement was approved by the fda on january  and the company expects to enroll these additional subjects in of the subjects enrolled in the pivotal study  have had the audio processor fitted and initial results evaluated and subjects have completed the five month protocol 
the study focuses on five primary end points absence of damage to residual hearing  functional gain  elimination of occlusion  reduction of acoustic feedback  and improved benefit in relation to the hearing aid as measured by a standard self assessment questionnaire 
the data on the limited number of subjects twelve evaluated so far appear to be consistent with the intended claims for the vibrant p soundbridge 
as of january   subjects have been implanted with the vibrant p and vibrant hf soundbridges in the company s united states clinical trials 
europe in march  the company completed a multi center en clinical trial in europe at seven institutions 
clinical sites were located in germany  italy  the netherlands  the united kingdom  switzerland and france 
the en protocol investigated the safety and performance of the vibrant soundbridge and the vibrant p soundbridge 
in the en trial  subjects were implanted with the company s soundbridges  with the first generation vibrant soundbridge and with the second generation vibrant p soundbridge 
with the vibrant soundbridge  performance was only evaluated for functional gain and the results were comparable to those achieved by the subjects in the united states trial 
with the vibrant p soundbridge  the subjects demonstrated functional gains as high as db at hz  db at hz  db at hz  db at hz  db at hz  db at hz  and db at hz 
these functional gain values reported were at user settings and did not necessarily reflect the maximum functional gains attainable with the device 
the results of the en trial were considered adequate by the company s notified body for purposes of affixing the ce mark to the vibrant p soundbridge 
subsequent to the completion of the en trial  the company received authorization to affix the ce mark to the vibrant p and hf soundbridges 
the company has begun selling the vibrant p soundbridge in europe  and the vibrant hf soundbridge is currently the subject of limited clinical testing 
as of january   approximately patients have been implanted with the vibrant p and vibrant hf soundbridges in europe including patients implanted in the company s en trial as well as patients implanted subsequent to the completion of the en trial 
there can be no assurance that the company s clinical trial efforts will progress as expected  not be delayed or that such efforts will lead to the successful development of any product 
no assurance can be given that any of the company s proposed clinical trials will continue to be allowed by the fda or other regulatory agencies or that clinical trials will commence as planned 
any delays in the company s clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
success in preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
further  there can be no assurance that if such testing of products under development is completed  any such devices will be accepted for formal review by the fda or approved by the fda for marketing in the united states 
research and development the company had employees engaged in research and development  including regulatory and clinical affairs  as of december  the company s research and development has focused on developing its patented core fmt technology  developing its family of vibrant soundbridges and conducting appropriate preclinical and clinical testing 
the company expended approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  on research and development 
the company anticipates that it will continue to expend substantial resources on completion of the development and clinical testing of the vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges  supporting manufacturing scale up and the development and clinical testing of the vibrant ti soundbridge 
in addition  the company may devote resources to the development of the vibrant xp soundbridge and the development of products for the treatment of conductive hearing loss 
product development involves a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products 
manufacturing the company currently manufactures its products in limited quantities for laboratory testing  for its clinical trials and for initial commercial sales 
the manufacture of the company s soundbridges is a complex operation involving a number of separate processes  components and assemblies 
each device is assembled and individually tested by the company 
the manufacturing process consists primarily of assembly of internally manufactured and purchased components and subassemblies  and certain processes are performed in an environmentally controlled area 
after completion of the manufacturing and testing processes  implantable devices are sterilized by a sub contracted supplier 
the company has no experience manufacturing its products in the volumes or with the yields that will be necessary for the company to achieve significant commercial sales  and there can be no assurance that the company can establish high volume manufacturing capacity or  if established  that the company will be able to manufacture its products in high volumes with commercially acceptable yields 
the company will need to expend significant capital resources and develop manufacturing expertise to establish commercial scale manufacturing capabilities 
furthermore  prior to approval of a pma  the company s facilities  procedures and practices will be subject to a pre approval inspection by the fda 
the company s inability to successfully manufacture or commercialize its soundbridges in a timely matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
raw materials  components and subassemblies for the company s soundbridges are purchased from various qualified suppliers and are subject to stringent quality specifications and inspections 
the company conducts quality audits of its key suppliers  several of whom are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of implantable medical devices  such as pacemakers  defibrillators and drug delivery pumps 
a number of components and subassemblies  such as silicone  signal processing electronics and implant packaging are provided by single source suppliers 
certain components of the vibrant p  vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges  the analog and digital signal processing microcircuits  are provided by sole source suppliers 
none of the company s suppliers is contractually obligated to continue to supply the company nor is the company contractually obligated to buy from a particular supplier 
for certain of these components and subassemblies  there are relatively few alternative sources of supply  and establishing additional or replacement suppliers for such components and subassemblies could not be accomplished quickly 
in addition  if the company wishes to significantly modify its manufacturing processes or change the supplier of a critical component  additional approvals will be required from the fda before the change can be implemented 
because of the long lead time for some components and subassemblies that are currently available from a single source  a supplier s inability or failure to supply such components or subassemblies in a timely manner or the company s decision to change suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities  and its operations must undergo quality system qs regulation compliance inspections conducted by the fda and corresponding state agencies 
additionally  prior to approval of a pma  the company s and its third party manufacturers facilities  procedures and practices will be subject to pre approval qs regulation inspections 
the company has been inspected by the food and drug branch of the california department of health services cdhs and a device manufacturing license has been issued to the company 
the company will be required to comply with the qs regulation requirements in order to produce products for sale in the united states and with applicable quality system standards and directives in order to produce products for sale in the eu 
any failure of the company to comply with the qs regulation or applicable standards and directives may result in the company being required to take corrective actions  such as modification of its policies and procedures 
pending such corrective actions  the company could be unable to manufacture or ship any products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales  marketing and training the primary market for the company s products in the united states is well defined and highly concentrated 
of the approximately  ent surgeons in the united states  approximately are specialists in otology 
the company believes that it can address this market with a direct sales force 
the company s strategy is to market its products initially to those specialists in otology who are currently most active in ear surgery  and  subsequently  to the general population of ent surgeons 
because the surgical procedure for implementing the company s soundbridges utilizes many of the same techniques employed by surgeons trained and experienced in cochlear implant surgery  the company believes that surgeon training will not be a significant impediment to market acceptance 
the company intends to position its family of vibrant soundbridges as technologically advanced implants that address an unmet patient need and add to the products and services that surgeons can offer 
patients who have traditionally been candidates for a hearing aid often are first seen by an ent surgeon  prior to being referred to a hearing device dealer or dispensing audiologist 
accordingly  endorsement by the surgical community will be an important goal of the company s marketing programs 
the company will also seek to develop a high degree of awareness by and endorsement from audiologists 
the company intends to promote the benefits of its products to consumers in order to expand usage to include not only those who are currently dissatisfied with hearing aids  but also those who have abandoned hearing aids due to either dissatisfaction or perceived social stigma 
the company has established a european sales and marketing organization which  as of december   is comprised of three marketing management and support personnel located in basel  switzerland and three sales managers performing direct sales activities in germany  france  the united kingdom  switzerland and austria 
in addition  the company has hired a sales manager for south america 
the company s initial selling efforts in europe have been targeted primarily at those ent surgeons specializing in otology 
while the company intends to continue to market its products to these specialists  it also plans to focus on the referring physicians  audiologists and the general population of ent surgeons in an attempt to increase the number of patients that are referred to specialist ear surgeons 
the company is also attempting to gather clinical and other data which it believes will be helpful in obtaining reasonable reimbursement levels for its products 
the company also has distributors in sweden  denmark  italy  spain  portugal  belgium  the netherlands  luxembourg  and certain countries in the middle east and north africa 
the company has also established a distributor for certain countries in south america 
in other international markets  including japan  the company will seek to establish a network of distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to build an adequate direct sales force or marketing organization in any country  that establishing a direct sales force or marketing organization will be cost effective or that the company s sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
in addition  the company has entered into distribution agreements with only a limited number of international distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into similar agreements with other qualified distributors on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the company  or at all  or that such distributors will devote adequate resources to selling the company s products 
failure to establish an adequate direct sales force domestically and in select international markets  and to enter into successful distribution relationships  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the medical device industry is subject to intense competition in the united states and abroad 
the company believes its products will compete primarily with the traditional approaches to managing hearing impairment  principally hearing aids 
principal manufacturers of acoustic hearing aids include siemens hearing instruments  inc  philips medical systems north america co  starkey laboratories inc  beltone electronics corp  dahlberg inc  resound corp  oticon  inc  widex hearing aid co  inc 
and phonak inc 
there can be no assurance that the company s soundbridges will be able to successfully compete with established hearing aid products 
although  to the company s knowledge  none of these acoustic hearing aid manufacturers are currently developing direct drive devices  there can be no assurance that these potential competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products in the future that are more effective  less expensive than those being developed by the company or that do not require surgery 
the company is aware of several university research groups and development stage companies that have active research or development programs related to direct drive sensorineural hearing devices 
research of this type has been conducted at various sites for over years 
in addition  some large medical device companies  some of which are currently marketing implantable medical devices  may develop programs in hearing management 
certain of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that certain of the company s competitors will not develop technologies and products that may be more effective in managing hearing impairment than the company s products or that render the company s products obsolete 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in the hearing management market will be the quality of the hearing enhancement  safety  whether surgery is required  reliability  endorsement by the surgeon and audiology communities  patient comfort  cosmetic result and price 
the company believes that it will be competitive with respect to these factors 
nonetheless  because the company s products are either under development or in the very early stages of commercialization  the relative competitive position of the company in the future is difficult to predict 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
accordingly  the company s success will depend in part on its ability to respond quickly to medical and technological change and user preference through the development and introduction of new products that are of high quality and that address patient and surgeon requirements 
patents and proprietary technology in the united states  the company holds issued patents and pending patent applications  of which have been allowed but not yet issued 
additionally  the company has issued and pending foreign patent applications 
these patents and patent applications generally cover the invention and application of the fmt as well as the specific application of the fmt and other concepts in the field of hearing impairment 
in addition  the company has licensed  on a royalty free basis  a united states patent covering the magnetic attachment of an external audio processor to an implanted receiver 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and processes  to preserve its trade secrets  and to operate without infringing or violating the proprietary rights of others 
the patent positions and trade secret provisions of medical device companies  including those of the company  are uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions 
the coverage sought in a patent application either can be denied or significantly reduced before or after the patent is issued 
consequently  there can be no assurance that any patents from pending applications or from any future patent application will be issued  that the scope of the patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to the company  that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged or that others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held by the company 
since patent applications are secret until patents are issued in the united states or corresponding applications are published in other countries  and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  the company cannot be certain that it was the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitors  many of which have substantial resources  will not seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with he company s ability to make  use or sell its products either in the united states or in international markets 
although the company has conducted searches of patents issued to other companies  research or academic institutions or others  there can be no assurance that such patents do not exist  have not been filed or could not be filed or issued  which contain claims relating to the company s technology  products or processes 
patents issued and patent applications filed in the united states or internationally relating to medical devices are numerous and there can be no assurance that current and potential competitors and other third parties have not filed or in the future will not file applications for  or have not received or in the future will not receive  patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to products or processes used or proposed to be used by the company 
in addition  patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries and the filing of related patent applications 
there may be pending applications  which if issued with claims in their present form  might provide proprietary rights to third parties relating to products or processes used or proposed to be used by the company 
the company may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others 
further  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation or regulatory proceedings  which could result in substantial cost and uncertainty to the company  may also be necessary to enforce patent or other intellectual property rights of the company or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources to defend its patents from infringement or claims of invalidity 
the company also relies upon trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary technology  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose the company s proprietary technology or that the company can meaningfully protect its rights in such unpatented proprietary technology 
the company s policy is to require each of its employees  consultants  investigators and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with the company 
these agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual during the term of the relationship shall be the exclusive property of the company and shall be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances 
there can be no assurance  however  that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for the company s proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
recently public law was signed into law in the united states and limits the enforcement of patents relating to the performance of surgical or medical procedures on a body 
this law precludes medical practitioners and health care entities  who practice these procedures  from being sued for patent infringement 
therefore  depending upon how these limitations are interpreted by the courts  they could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to enforce any of its proprietary methods or procedures deemed to be surgical or medical procedures on a body 
in certain other countries outside the united states  patent coverage relating to the performance of surgical or medical procedures is not available 
therefore  patent coverage in such countries will be limited to the fmt or to narrower aspects of the fmt 
the medical device industry in general has been characterized by substantial litigation 
litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to respond to and could distract the company s technical and management personnel 
the company may become involved in litigation to defend against claims of infringement by the company  to enforce patents issued to the company or to protect trade secrets of the company 
if any relevant claims of third party patents are held as infringed and not invalid in any litigation or administrative proceeding  the company could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in such patents  or would be required to obtain licenses from the patent owners of each such patent  or to redesign its products or processes to avoid infringement 
in addition  in the event of any possible infringement  there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or processes to avoid such infringement or in obtaining licenses on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure by the company to redesign its products or processes or to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling its products  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company has not been involved in any litigation to date  in the future  costly and time consuming litigation brought by the company may be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by the company  or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
government regulation the company s medical products  such as the vibrant soundbridge  are regulated as medical devices 
accordingly  clinical trials  product development  labeling  manufacturing processes and promotional activities are subject to extensive review and rigorous regulation by government agencies in most countries in which the company will seek to commercialize its products 
united states in the united states  the company s products are subject to applicable provisions of the united states federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act  and other federal statutes and regulations governing  among other things  the design  manufacture  testing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  reporting  approval  advertising and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters  fines  recalls or seizure of products  civil penalties  injunctions  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of approval or refusal to approve new marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
pursuant to the fdc act  the fda regulates the design  manufacture  distribution  preclinical and clinical study and approval of medical devices in the united states 
medical devices are classified in one of three classes class i  class ii or class iii on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness 
safety and effectiveness is considered to be reasonably assured for class i devices through general controls eg  labeling  premarket notification and adherence to current qs regulations and for class ii devices through the use of additional special controls eg  performance standards  post market surveillance  patient registries and fda guidelines 
generally  class iii devices are those which must receive premarket approval by the fda to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness eg  life sustaining  life supporting and implantable devices  or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices  or devices whose safety and effectiveness cannot be reasonably assured through general controls  even if supplemented by additional special controls 
active implantable devices  such as the company s implantable hearing devices  are considered class iii devices 
before a new device can be introduced to the market  the manufacturer generally must obtain fda clearance through a k premarket notification or fda approval through a pma application 
while the company has no products for which it expects to seek k clearance  it may file k submissions with respect to future products 
a k clearance will generally only be granted if the information submitted to the fda establishes that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate medical device 
frequently  the fda will require clinical data in support of a k submission  and the k process can become time consuming and expensive 
significant modifications of the labeling  manufacturing and design of any product that has been cleared through the k process will require a new k premarket notification  if those modifications could significantly affect the safety  effectiveness or intended use of the device 
a pma must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the k process 
a pma must be supported by extensive data  including  but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trials  manufacturing  and labeling to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device 
the company believes that all versions of the vibrant soundbridge currently under development are class iii devices and will require a pma  as will future configurations of implantable hearing devices 
the fda has recently implemented a new streamlined pma process called the modular pma 
under the modular pma process  modules reflecting the content requirements of a traditional pma can be submitted as they are completed  allowing them to be reviewed and approved in a sequential manner 
before the company s products can be commercialized in the united states  the company must submit  in a pma  extensive data on preclinical studies and clinical trials  device design  manufacturing  labeling  promotion and advertising  as well as other aspects of the product 
in addition  the company must submit clinical data gathered in trials conducted under an ide demonstrating to the satisfaction of the fda that the product is safe and effective for its labeling claims  and obtain marketing approval from the fda 
phase i of the ide study has been completed 
phase i was limited to two sites and five subjects and was intended to test the safety and provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the device and the surgical procedure used to implant the device 
in november  the company filed an ide supplement summarizing the phase i results  finalizing the study protocol and proposed labeling claims  providing technical information regarding the vibrant p soundbridge  and requested permission to proceed to the pivotal study 
in december  the fda approved the multi center pivotal study in subjects at up to sites with the second generation vibrant p soundbridge 
in november the company received fda approval of an ide supplement to include the vibrant hf soundbridge in this study 
the company has enrolled subjects in the study 
however  because the ide supplement allowing the inclusion of the vibrant hf soundbridge was approved when enrollment was almost complete only one of the subjects is to be fitted with a vibrant hf soundbridge 
to facilitate enrollment of a greater number of subjects who receive the vibrant hf soundbridge  on december   the company requested fda approval of an ide supplement to allow an additional subjects 
this ide supplement was approved by the fda on january  and the company expects to enroll these additional subjects in there can be no assurance that the company s clinical trial effort will progress as expected  will not be delayed or that such effort will lead to the successful development of any product 
no assurance can be given that any of the company s clinical trials will continue to be allowed by the fda or other regulatory agencies or that clinical trials will commence as planned 
any delays in the company s clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
success in preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
further  there can be no assurance that if such testing of products under development is completed  any such devices will be accepted for formal review by the fda  or approved by the fda for marketing in the united states 
after a pma is filed  the fda begins its review of the submitted information  which generally takes between one and two years  but may take significantly longer 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
also during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda will be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with qs regulation requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet the fda s requirements or that any necessary approval will be granted in a reasonable time frame  or at all 
new pmas or pma supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacture  labeling and design of a device that is approved through the pma process 
supplements to a pma often require submission of the same type of information as a pma  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and can frequently require several years 
even when a pma is approved  the fda may impose restrictions on the indications for which the device can be marketed 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain necessary approvals on a timely basis  or at all  and delays in obtaining or failure to obtain such approvals  the loss of previously obtained approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
subsequent to the receipt of an fda approval  the company will continue to be regulated by the fda with regard to the reporting of adverse events related to its products  and ongoing compliance with qs regulation 
the company s manufacturing facility must be registered with the fda and the cdhs and will be subject to periodic inspections by the fda and by the cdhs 
a device manufacturing license has been issued by the state of california and this license must be renewed annually for the company to continue manufacture of medical devices in california 
europe the primary regulatory environment in europe is that of the eu which consists of countries encompassing most of the major countries in europe 
the eu has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design  manufacture  clinical trial  labeling  and adverse event reporting for medical devices 
the principal directives prescribing the laws and regulations pertaining to medical devices in the eu are the medical devices directive eec mdd and the active implantable medical devices directive eec aimdd 
in the eu  the company s soundbridges will be regulated as active implantables and therefore be governed by the aimdd 
for products  such as those of the company  that have not previously been commercialized in the eu  ce marking is required prior to initiation of sales in the eu 
certain other countries  such as switzerland  have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the eu with respect to medical devices 
devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear ce conformity marking  indicating that the device conforms with the essential requirements of the applicable directive  and accordingly  can be commercially distributed throughout the eu 
the method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product  but normally involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a notified body 
this third party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer s product 
an assessment by a notified body in one country within the eu is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the eu 
for purposes of determining the necessary steps for assessing conformity  devices are classified under the directives as class i  class iia  class iib  class iii  or active implantable medical devices 
devices having a higher classification are considered to have a higher risk and  accordingly  are subject to more controls in order to bear ce marking 
the vibrant soundbridge is designated as an active implantable medical device 
essential requirements under the aimdd include substantiating that the device meets the manufacturer s performance claims and that safety issues  if any  constitute an acceptable risk when weighed against the intended benefits of the device 
the two principal aspects of assessing conformity for active implantable medical devices are determinations from the notified body that the processes employed in the design and manufacture of a device qualify as a full quality system in compliance with applicable standards eg  en iso  en and eec  and that the technical  preclinical  and clinical data gathered on the device are adequate to support ce marking 
the company has undergone an inspection by its notified body and its quality system has been certified by the notified body as being in compliance with the required standards 
the company has received approval to affix the ce mark to the vibrant p and vibrant hf soundbridges 
with regard to the vibrant d soundbridge  the company intends to submit the technical data that its notified body has indicated will be required to satisfy the essential requirements of the aimdd 
to satisfy these requirements  the company generally must complete a clinical trial conducted under european clinical trial standards en to determine the safety and performance of the products 
the vibrant hf and vibrant d soundbridges utilize the same implanted component as the vibrant p soundbridge 
accordingly  the notified body did not require additional clinical data for the vibrant hf soundbridge 
the notified body has not yet  but may  request additional clinical data for the vibrant d soundbridge 
the company must continue to pass annual en iso  en and aimdd quality system audits in order to retain the authorization to affix the ce mark to its products 
once a manufacturer has satisfactorily completed the regulatory compliance tasks required by the directives and received favorable determinations by the notified body  it is eligible to place the ce mark on its products 
manufacturers are subject to ongoing regulation under the aimdd 
the quality system will be subject to periodic audit and recertification  and serious adverse events must be reported to the authorities in the country where the incident takes place 
if such incidents occur  the manufacturer may have to take remedial action  including withdrawal of the product from the eu market 
while no additional premarket approvals in individual eu countries are required  prior to the marketing of a device bearing the ce mark  practical complications with respect to market introduction may occur 
for example  differences among countries have arisen with regard to labeling requirements 
also  as the directives do not cover reimbursement and distribution practices  differences may occur in these and other areas 
third party reimbursement the company believes that its products will generally be purchased by hospitals and clinics upon the recommendation of a surgeon 
in the united states  hospitals  physicians and other health care providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  principally medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other sources of reimbursement for health care costs  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the medical device is being used 
such third party payors have become increasingly sensitive to cost containment in recent years and place a high degree of scrutiny on coverage and payment decisions for new technologies and procedures 
hearing aids  which do not involve surgery and  in certain cases  are exempt from the requirement for k approval  are generally not reimbursed  although a modest reimbursement is provided under certain insurance plans 
traditionally  hearing aid users have paid for these devices directly 
for cochlear implants  however  that are technologically advanced and fda approved through the pma process for the treatment of profound hearing impairment  a reimbursement is available for the device  the audiological testing  and the surgery 
similarly  reimbursement is available for ossicular replacement prostheses that are fda approved for the treatment of conductive hearing impairment 
the company anticipates that  as surgically implanted devices that require fda pma approval  the company s products may also be the subject of reimbursement in the future 
during clinical trials  the company does not anticipate that there will be any reimbursement for the vibrant soundbridge implant or procedure 
the company s strategy is to pursue reimbursement for the company s soundbridges  once a pma is approved by the fda  based on surgeon endorsement and demonstration of improved quality of life for specific patient groups 
quality of life issues are included in the company s clinical trial to provide data in support of this reimbursement strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to demonstrate improvement in quality of life or that reimbursement will ever be available for the company s products 
certain third party payors are moving toward a managed care system in which they contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
the fixed cost per person established by these third party payors may be independent of the hospital s cost incurred for the specific case and the specific devices used 
medicare and other third party payors are increasingly scrutinizing whether to cover new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
because the company s hearing prostheses are currently under development and have not received fda clearance or approval  uncertainty exists regarding the availability of third party reimbursement for procedures that would use the company s soundbridges 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other potential users of the company s soundbridges to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for the procedures in which the company s soundbridges are intended to be used could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
third party payors that do not use prospectively fixed payments increasingly use other cost containment processes or require various outcomes data that may pose administrative hurdles to the use of the company s soundbridges 
in addition  third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a procedure is unnecessary  inappropriate  experimental  used for a non approved indication or is not cost effective 
potential purchasers must determine that the clinical benefits of the company s products justify the additional cost or the additional effort required to obtain prior authorization or coverage and the uncertainty of actually obtaining such authorization or coverage 
even after obtaining the necessary foreign regulatory approvals  market acceptance of the company s products and products currently under development in international markets will be dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
the company believes that in europe  the primary source of funding for products such as the company s soundbridges is the various government sponsored healthcare programs 
requirements for the granting of reimbursement in many countries are not clearly specified and may involve the collection of additional clinical data in support of submissions to the appropriate health care administrations 
there can be no assurance that any required data would be available on a timely basis or that any international reimbursement approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have a material adverse effect on market acceptance of the company s products in the eu as well as in international markets in which such approvals are sought 
the company believes that in the future reimbursement will be subject to increased restrictions both in the united states and in international markets 
the company believes that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services will continue to lead to increased pressures on the health care industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services  including the company s products and products currently under development 
there can be no assurance in either united states or international markets that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  that future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for the company s products or products currently under development or its ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
the unavailability of third party payor coverage or the inadequacy of reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability the company s business involves the inherent risk of product liability claims 
the company maintains limited product liability insurance at coverage levels which the company believes to be commercially reasonable and adequate given the company s current operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that such insurance will be adequate to cover liabilities that may arise 
any claims that are brought against the company could  if successful  have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees at december   the company had employees 
of these employees  were in research and development  including regulatory and clinical affairs  were in manufacturing and quality assurance and were in administration  sales and marketing 
none of the company s employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the company believes that it maintains good relations with its employees 
scientific advisory board the company has established a scientific advisory board consisting of five leading professionals in the fields of otology  otolaryngology and audiology 
the board meets periodically and reviews the company s clinical progress and product development plans 
the company has also established an audiology advisory board consisting of five leading audiologists 
this board brings an audiological perspective to clinical protocol issues  and audiological testing and results 
in addition to periodic meetings of the boards  members of the boards are available on an individual basis to consult with the company 
each member of the scientific advisory board has received options for stock  pursuant to the option plan  for participation on the board 
item properties the company s principal administrative  manufacturing and research and development facility occupies approximately  square feet in san jose  california  pursuant to a lease that expires in december the company has established an office in basel  switzerland for the headquarters of its european sales and marketing organization 
the company believes that its facilities are adequate for its business as presently operated

symphonix is developing a family of proprietary semi implantable and implantable soundbridges for the management of moderate to severe hearing impairment 
the company s family of vibrant soundbridges is based on its patented core fmt technology 
the company received the authorization to affix the ce mark to the first generation vibrant soundbridge and the second generation vibrant p soundbridge in march and the vibrant hf soundbridge in july the company began selling activities for the vibrant p soundbridge in the european union in march and plans to commence selling activities for the vibrant hf in europe after it has gathered clinical data on a limited number of patients 
the company has established a european sales and marketing organization which  as of december   is comprised of three marketing management and support personnel located in basel  switzerland and three sales managers performing direct sales activities in germany  france  the united kingdom  switzerland and austria 
in addition  the company has hired a sales manager for south america 
the company s initial selling efforts in europe have been targeted primarily at those ent surgeons specializing in otology 
while the company intends to continue to market its products to these specialists  it also plans to focus on the referring physicians  audiologists and the general population of ent surgeons in an attempt to increase the number of patients that are referred to specialist ear surgeons 
the company is also attempting to gather clinical and other data which it believes will be helpful in obtaining reasonable reimbursement levels for its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to increase the number of patients who become candidates for the company s soundbridges or in obtaining reimbursement for its products 
in september the company initiated clinical trials of the vibrant soundbridge in the united states 
on december   the fda approved a multi center pivotal study in subjects at up to sites with the second generation vibrant p soundbridge 
as of january  the company had enrolled a total of subjects in this pivotal study 
during the year ending december   the company was selected by the fda to participate in the new  streamlined pma process called the modular pma 
under the modular pma process  modules reflecting the content requirements of a traditional pma are submitted as they are completed  allowing them to be reviewed and approved in a sequential manner 
to date  the company has submitted four modules of its pma for the vibrant p soundbridge 
there can be no assurance that the company s participation in the modular pma program will lead to the timely approval of the vibrant p soundbridge  if at all 
in november  the fda approved the inclusion of the vibrant hf soundbridge in the existing pivotal trial  and in january granted the company permission to enroll an additional subjects for purposes of evaluating the vibrant hf soundbridge 
symphonix has a limited operating history 
through december  the company had not generated significant revenue from product sales and had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company expects to incur substantial losses through at least to date  the company s principal sources of funding have been net proceeds from its initial public offering completed in february  private equity financings  an equipment lease financing and bank borrowings 
results of operations revenue 
revenue of  was recorded in the year ended december  for sales of the vibrant p soundbridge in europe 
no revenue was recorded in or because the company had no product sales in those years 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was million in the year ended december   and represents the direct cost of the products sold as well as a portion of the manufacturing overhead 
there was no cost of goods sold for or because the company had no product sales in those years 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  professional services  materials  supplies and equipment in support of product development  clinical trials  regulatory submissions  preparation and filing of patent applications and the start up of manufacturing 
research and development expenses increased from to in part due to higher facility costs attributable to the commencement of a lease on a new facility in january in addition  the company increased the level of spending on supplies  professional services and equipment and hired more employees 
during  the company increased its product development efforts  developed clinical research and regulating functions  initiated clinical trials and established a pilot manufacturing capability 
to support these activities  the company hired more employees and increased the level of spending on supplies  professional services and equipment 
the company expects its research and development expenses to increase in  primarily due to the development of the vibrant ti soundbridge 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel  marketing  legal and consulting costs 
expenses increased from to  due to the establishment of a european sales and marketing organization  the initiation of selling and marketing activities in europe  amortization of deferred compensation and increases in administrative costs associated with expanded operations and becoming a public company 
expenses increased from to due to increases in the level of staffing and spending on professional services as the company expanded the scope of its operations 
the company plans to expand its european sales organization in and as a result expects selling general and administrative expenses to increase in deferred compensation of million was recorded in  representing the difference between the exercise prices of certain options granted and the deemed fair value of the company s common stock on the grant dates 
deferred compensation expense of  and  attributed to such options was amortized during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining deferred compensation will be amortized over the vesting period of the options generally four years 
interest income  net 
interest income  net was million   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
most of the increase from to was generated from interest income on net proceeds from the company s february initial public offering 
income taxes 
to date  the company has not incurred any us income tax obligations 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal and million for state income tax purposes  which will expire at various dates through and  respectively  if not utilized 
the principal differences between losses for financial and tax reporting purposes are the result of the capitalization of research and development and start up expenses for tax purposes 
united states and state tax laws contain provisions that may limit the net operating loss carryforwards that can be used in any given year  should certain changes in the beneficial ownership of the company s outstanding common stock occur 
such events could limit the future utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has funded its operations and its capital expenditures from net proceeds of its initial public offering completed in february totaling million  from the private sale of equity securities totaling million  from an equipment lease financing totaling million and from bank borrowings totaling million  net 
at december   the company had million in working capital  and its primary source of liquidity was million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
capital expenditures  related primarily to the company s research and development and manufacturing activities  were million   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increased capital expenditures in and relate primarily to the company s new facility 
at december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
in october the company entered into a lease agreement for a new facility for a five year term commencing january during the quarter ended march  the company relocated its research and development and administrative functions to the new facility 
the company completed the relocation of its manufacturing activities to the new facility in april through december   the company has made approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily attributable to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures related to the new facility 
the company has a loan agreement with a bank providing for borrowings of up to million and for the issuance of letters of credit up to  at december   the company had borrowings of million and an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of  under the loan agreement 
borrowings under the loan agreement are repayable over four years commencing in january symphonix used million in cash for operations in  an increase of million from the million used in the increase was primarily due to an increase in net loss from to the company will expend substantial funds in the future for research and development  preclinical and clinical testing  capital expenditures and the manufacturing  marketing and sale of its products 
the timing and amount of spending of such capital resources cannot be accurately predicted and will depend on several factors including the availability of third party reimbursement  the progress of the company s research and development efforts and preclinical and clinical activities  competing technological and market developments  the time and costs of obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the progress and cost of commercialization of products currently under development  market acceptance and demand for the company s products in the united states  if approved for marketing  and internationally and other factors not within the company s control 
while the company believes that its existing capital will be sufficient to fund its operations and its capital investments through  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing prior to that time 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the company  or at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company could be required to delay development or commercialization of certain of its products  license to third parties the rights to commercialize certain products or technologies that the company would otherwise seek to commercialize for itself  or reduce the marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to certain of its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the company has initiated planning for issues related to the upcoming new millennium 
these issues derive from the use of software and hardware with embedded chips or processors that use two digits to refer to a year and do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
the use of such software and hardware occurs at many internal and external points in the company s development  supply  manufacturing and distribution chain both within the company s internal operations as well as at important external partners  such as vendors and customers 
the company has developed a plan to address these issues and to enhance the company s readiness for year the company s plan the year readiness program focuses on five areas network and facility infrastructure  business applications software  process control systems  external partners  and the company s products 
within each area  the year readiness program will involve a the identification of systems that may be susceptible to year issues the identification phase  b the assessment of the degree of readiness of those systems for the year and an assessment of the risks that may be posed to the company s business the assessment phase  c the remediation of problems that are identified the remediation phase  and d contingency planning 
network and facility infrastructure included in this category are the computer networks in the company s san jose  california headquarters and basel  switzerland european headquarters including servers  computers  other network equipment and computer and network operating systems  together with general facility systems such as telephone and security systems 
the company expects that the identification and assessment phases will be completed during the first quarter of  at which time remediation and contingency planning will be initiated as appropriate 
business applications software included in this category are various applications used in design  manufacturing  distribution and finance 
the company s primary business application is a company wide system used for manufacturing planning  accounting  inventory management and sales transactions 
the company expects that the identification and assessment phases will be completed during the second quarter of  at which time remediation and contingency planning will be initiated as appropriate 
for many software applications  the company will  in the assessment phase  rely on the software developer s representations regarding year compliance of their software 
there can be no assurance  however  that software applications represented by developers as being year compliant will be free from year errors and defects 
process control systems included in this category are instrumentation and systems used in design and manufacturing processes 
the company expects that the identification and assessment phases will be completed during the second quarter of at which time remediation and contingency planning will be initiated as appropriate 
external partners the company intends to assess the possible effects on its operations of the year compliance of certain relevant third parties  such as customers and service providers by using questionnaires and  in limited cases  site visits and interviews to solicit information from these parties 
in the event the company identifies a problem with respect to a particular vendor  then the company may be forced to identify alternative sources of supply 
however  the company s ability to seek alternative sources of supply is subject to fda restrictions and may involve extensive validation processes 
the failure to timely identify and validate an alternative supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects to complete the identification phase and initiate the assessment phase by the first quarter of symphonix products the company s products are regulated by the fda and the fda has advised manufacturers of medical devices to address readiness of their products for year issues 
the company has completed a preliminary assessment and has informed the fda that the company does not believe that any of its existing products are susceptible to year issues 
the company does not expect to incur costs in its year readiness program that will be material to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  until the company completes the identification and assessment phases of its program  the full extent of the remediation costs will not be known and there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources  such as consultants and professional advisors  in implementing the year readiness program and the company currently estimates that the external resources required during the identification and assessment phases of the year readiness program will cost approximately  because the year readiness program is an ongoing process  all cost estimates are subject to change 
specific contingency plans will be developed upon completion of the assessment phases and may include additional procurement of inventory to assure continued supply from vendors 
although the company intends to complete all phases of its year readiness program by december   there can be no assurance  even if this program is successfully completed on schedule  that disruptions in the company s business will be avoided 
the year issues are pervasive in nature and involve highly technical issues  not all of which are under the company s control 
possible consequences of year issues that the company is unable to adequately identify  assess or remediate include but are not limited to delays in supplies from vendors  delays in shipment to customers  errors in processing transactions  deficiencies in management of inventory  delays in collection of funds from customers  and diversion of management time and effort to addressing difficulties that emerge 
the goal of the company s year readiness program is to plan for and reduce the risk of such difficulties 
there can be no assurance that the year readiness program will be completed in a timely manner or will be successful 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities

as required for its first quarterly filing of additional factors that might affect future results history of losses and expectation of future losses 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
since the company s inception in  substantially all of the company s resources have been dedicated to research and development  establishment of a european sales and marketing organization and the initiation of sales and marketing activities in europe 
in march  the company received the authorization to affix the ce mark to the vibrant and vibrant p soundbridges  permitting the initiation of commercial sales in the european union eu 
although the company has commenced selling the vibrant p soundbridge in europe  through december  the company has not generated significant revenues from these sales 
the company received ce mark approval for the vibrant hf soundbridge in july and plans to commence selling the vibrant hf soundbridge after it has gathered clinical data on a limited number of patients 
in the united states  the company s vibrant p and vibrant hf soundbridges will require additional clinical testing prior to the submission of a regulatory application for commercial use 
all of the company s other products will require additional development  and preclinical and clinical testing prior to the submission of a regulatory application for commercial use internationally and domestically 
since the vibrant p soundbridge only recently became available for sale in the eu and is not currently available for sale in the united states  significant product revenues will not be realized for at least several years  if ever 
the company expects its operating losses to continue at least through the year as it continues to expend substantial funds for clinical trials in support of regulatory approvals  expansion of research and development activities and establishment of commercial scale manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s soundbridges will be successfully commercialized internationally or in the united states or that the company will achieve significant revenues from product sales 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
the company s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year and will depend upon numerous factors  including action relating to regulatory matters  progress of clinical trials  the timing and scope of research and development efforts  the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance or achieve reasonable reimbursement levels  the timing of scale up of manufacturing capabilities  the timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities and competition 
limited clinical testing experience 
in the united states  the company has conducted only limited clinical trials of the vibrant and vibrant p soundbridges 
the company has received approval of an ide to conduct a clinical trial of the vibrant  vibrant p and vibrant hf soundbridges 
in europe  the vibrant and vibrant p soundbridges have been the subject of limited clinical testing 
the company intends to conduct clinical testing of the external components of the vibrant hf soundbridge 
the implanted components of the vibrant hf soundbridge are the same as the implanted components of the vibrant p soundbridge which was tested in clinical trials previously conducted by the company in europe 
none of the company s other soundbridges under development have been tested in human clinical trials and these soundbridges will require additional development  clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to commercialization 
the results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later clinical trials  and there can be no assurance that clinical trials conducted by the company will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain requisite approvals 
the rate of completion of the company s clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including slower than anticipated patient enrollment or adverse events occurring during clinical trials 
completion of preclinical and clinical activities may take several years  and the length of time for completion of the required studies is unpredictable 
in addition  data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
no assurance can be given that any of the company s clinical trials will be successfully completed on a timely basis  or at all  that additional clinical trials will be allowed by the fda or other regulatory authorities or that such clinical trials will commence as planned 
any delays in the company s clinical trials would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
success in preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
reliance on fmt technology 
the company has concentrated its efforts primarily on the development  implementation and acceptance of the fmt  the patented core direct drive technology upon which all of the company s soundbridges are based 
the company s soundbridges employ a direct drive approach to the management of hearing impairment  which is a novel development 
there can be no assurance that the company s soundbridges  based on the company s fmt technology  will prove to be safe and effective  or that if proven safe and effective  can be manufactured at a reasonable cost or successfully commercialized 
no assurance of market acceptance 
the market acceptance of the company s soundbridges will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and patients as clinically useful  reliable and cost effective compared to other devices 
clinical acceptance will depend on numerous factors  including the establishment of the safety and the effectiveness of the soundbridge s ability to drive the ossicles directly and improve hearing over currently available hearing aids 
clinical acceptance will also depend on the receipt of regulatory approvals in the united states and the company s ability to adequately train ear surgeons on the techniques for implanting the company s soundbridges 
there can be no assurance that the company s soundbridges will be preferable alternatives to existing devices  some of which  such as the acoustic hearing aid  do not require surgery  or that the company s soundbridges will not be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive by products under development by other companies 
patient acceptance of the company s soundbridges will depend in part upon physician  audiologist and surgeon recommendations as well as other factors  including the effectiveness  safety  reliability and invasiveness of the procedure as compared to established approaches 
prior to undergoing surgery for the implantation of the company s soundbridge  a patient may speak with a number of medical professionals  including the patient s primary care physician  an audiologist  an ent specialist  as well as surgeons who specialize in ear surgery 
the failure by any of these medical professionals to favorably recommend the company s products and the surgery required to implant the soundbridge could limit the number of potential patients who are introduced to an ear surgeon as candidates for the company s soundbridges 
even if the company s soundbridges are adopted by the medical community  a significant market may not develop for the company s products unless acceptable reimbursement from health care payors is available 
there can be no assurance that the company s soundbridges will be accepted by the medical community or consumers  that acceptable reimbursement from third party payors will be available or that market demand for such products will be sufficient to allow the company to achieve profitable operations 
failure of the company s soundbridges  for whatever reason  to achieve significant adoption by the medical community or consumers or failure of the company s products to achieve any significant market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future capital requirements  uncertainty of additional funding 
the company will expend substantial funds in the future for research and development  preclinical and clinical testing  capital expenditures and the manufacturing  marketing and sale of its products 
the timing and amount of spending of such capital resources cannot be accurately predicted and will depend upon several factors  including the progress of its research and development efforts and preclinical and clinical activities  competing technological and market developments  the time and costs of obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the progress and cost of commercialization of products currently under development  market acceptance and demand for the company s products in the united states  if approved for marketing  and internationally and other factors not within the company s control 
on february   the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
on february   the company completed the sale of an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an over allotment option 
net proceeds to the company totaled approximately million 
while the company believes that the net proceeds of the offering  together with its previously existing capital resources and projected interest income  will be sufficient to fund its operations and its capital investments through  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing prior to that time 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to the company  or at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  the company could be required to delay development or commercialization of certain of its products  to license to third parties the rights to commercialize certain products or technologies that the company would otherwise seek to commercialize for itself  or to reduce the marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to certain of its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel 
the company s future success depends in significant part upon the continued service of certain key scientific  technical and management personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key scientific  technical and managerial personnel or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in the future 
the loss of key personnel  especially if without advance notice  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has not entered into employment agreements with any of its key personnel 
the company is the beneficiary under a million key man insurance policy on harry s 
robbins  its president and chief executive officer 
volatility of stock the market prices for securities of medical device companies have historically been highly volatile 
announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to products under development by the company or others  regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries and public concern as to the safety of new technologies  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure of the company to meet such estimates and other factors may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
in addition  the company believes that fluctuations in its operating results may cause the market price of its common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the company s investment portfolio 
the company s fixed rate debt obligations are subject to interest rate risk with minimal impact 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly affect the company s net loss 
much of the company s revenue and all of its capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily certain european currencies 
at december   the company performed sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates should not materially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
