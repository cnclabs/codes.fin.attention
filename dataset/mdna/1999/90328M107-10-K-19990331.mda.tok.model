item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview usana develops and manufactures high quality nutritional  personal care and weight management products 
the company distributes its products through a network marketing system 
as of january   the company had approximately  current distributors in the united states  canada  australia  new zealand and the united kingdom 
the australia new zealand and the united kingdom markets initiated operations on february  and november   respectively 
the company defines a current distributor as a distributor who has made a purchase in the most recent twelve month period 
from to  net sales of the company grew from million to million  while net earnings increased from a loss of  to net earnings of million 
the company s three primary product lines consist of nutritional  personal care and weight management products 
nutritional products accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in the company s top selling products  usana essentials and proflavanol  represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales in no other products accounted for more than of net sales during the year 
usana s personal care line includes skin  hair and body  and dental care products 
the company s weight management line includes a dietary supplement in tablet form  food bars  meal entrees  instructional videos and other products developed to provide a comprehensive approach to weight management  proper diet  nutrition and healthy living 
in june  the company introduced several new products  including coquinone  procosamine  the usana dental care system and an in home water distillation system 
in addition to its primary product lines  the company also sells distributor kits and sales aids which accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in net sales of the company are primarily dependent upon the efforts of a network of independent distributors who purchase products and sales materials 
the company also offers a preferred customer program specifically designed for customers who desire to purchase usana s products for personal consumption  while choosing not to become independent distributors 
as of january   the company had approximately  preferred customers 
the company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and title passes to independent distributors and preferred customers 
in  sales in the company s four primary markets  the united states  canada  australia new zealand and the united kingdom  were   and  respectively  of net sales of the company 
as the company expands into additional international markets  the company expects international operations to account for an increasing percentage of its net sales 
cost of sales primarily consists of expenses related to raw materials  labor  quality assurance and overhead directly associated with the procurement and production of usana s products and sales materials as well as duties and taxes associated with product exports 
in  products manufactured by the company accounted for approximately of its net sales 
as international sales increase as a percentage of net sales  the company expects that its overall cost of sales could increase slightly  reflecting additional duties  freight and other expenses associated with international expansion 
distributor incentives are the company s most significant expense and represented of net sales in distributor incentives include commissions and leadership bonuses  and are paid weekly based on sales volume points 
each product sold by the company is assigned a sales volume point value independent of the product s price 
distributors earn commissions based on sales volume points generated in their downline 
generally  distributor kits  sales aids and logo merchandise  such as items of clothing and luggage  have no sales volume point value and therefore the company pays no commissions on the sale of these items 
the company closely monitors the amount of distributor incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may from time to time adjust its distributor compensation plan to prevent distributor incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings  while continuing to maintain an appropriate incentive for its distributors 
for example  in the third quarter of  the company introduced a repricing strategy across its product lines that created a spread between the price a distributor pays for the product and the sales volume point value associated with the product 
this new price strategy had the effect of reducing the amount of total distributor incentives paid as a percentage of net sales 
at the same time  the company changed its leadership bonus program  increasing the payout from to of total sales volume points 
selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and benefits  depreciation and amortization  rents and utilities  distributor events  promotion and advertising  and professional fees along with other marketing and administrative expenses 
wages and benefits represent the largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company expects to add human resources and associated infrastructure as operations expand 
the president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the company  dr 
wentz  does not receive a salary  and the company does not anticipate that dr 
wentz will take a salary for the foreseeable future 
however  if dr 
wentz were to take a salary  selling  general and administrative expenses would increase 
depreciation and amortization expense has increased as a result of substantial investments in computer and telecommunications equipment and systems to support international expansion 
the company anticipates that additional capital investments will be required in future periods to promote and support growth in sales and the increasing size of the distributor and preferred customer base 
research and development expenses include costs incurred in developing new products  supporting and enhancing existing products and reformulating products for introduction in international markets 
the company capitalizes product development costs after market feasibility is established 
these costs are amortized as cost of sales over an average of months  beginning with the month the products become available for sale 
in  the company adopted a week fiscal year 
commencing with fiscal year  the fiscal year end of the company was changed from december of each year to the saturday closest to december references to a particular fiscal year are to the fiscal year ending on such saturday for fiscal years and later  and to the year ended december for fiscal years and earlier 
fiscal year was a week year 
fiscal year was a week year 
management believes the additional week in fiscal did not have a material impact on earnings

net sales increased to million in  an increase of million from million in approximately of the growth in net sales for this period was attributable to increases in total unit sales 
the increase in unit sales is primarily the result of a increase in the company s independent distributor base and continued growth in its preferred customer program  which was introduced in the third quarter of as of january   the company had approximately  current distributors compared to approximately  current distributors at december  approximately of the growth in the distributor base can be associated with the opening of the australia new zealand market in february as of january   the company had approximately  preferred customers 
successful regional conventions  new product introductions and the product price increase in the third quarter of also contributed to sales growth in the following table illustrates the growth in sales by region for the years ended december  and january  sales growth by region in millions year ended december  january  growth over net sales net sales net sales net sales prior year growth region united states canada australia new zealand united kingdom cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million in  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales decreased slightly to in from in the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales can be attributed primarily to the price increase introduced in the third quarter of and volume based efficiencies in production and procurement activities 
these factors were partially offset by additional costs such as freight and duties associated with exporting products to australia new zealand and the united kingdom  and a change in the sales mix to include a higher percentage of distributor kits which have a significantly lower gross profit margin 
when a new market is opened  the company initially experiences a higher demand for distributor kits in that market 
distributor incentives 
distributor incentives increased to million in  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of net sales  distributor incentives decreased to in from in the decrease in distributor incentives as a percentage of net sales can be attributed primarily to the implementation of the company s repricing strategy and a change in the sales mix that resulted from increased demand for distributor kits in the australia new zealand market 
the decrease in distributor incentives as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by an increase in the company s leadership bonus program from to of the sales volume points generated 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed to several factors higher variable expenses such as increases in customer service staffing levels and discount fees on credit cards in association with growth in sales and the increased number of distributors and preferred customers  increased depreciation and amortization expense of approximately as a percentage of net sales as a result of substantial investments in current and prior periods in computer and telecommunications equipment to support growth and international expansion  increased costs including  but not limited to  employee compensation as a result of building a company infrastructure to meet strategic objectives  and higher relative costs associated with international expansion  primarily related to commencing operations in australia new zealand and the united kingdom

net earnings 
net earnings increased to million in  an increase of million from million in the increase in net earnings is primarily the result of higher sales 
net earnings reflect the combined effect of decreased cost of sales  decreased distributor incentives  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses relative to net sales  which resulted in a profit margin in compared to in diluted earnings per share increased to in  an increase of from in years ended december  and december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in  an increase of million from million in the increase in net sales is primarily the result of a increase in the company s independent distributor base and continued growth in its preferred customer program 
as of december   the company had approximately  current distributors compared to an estimated  current distributors at december  the company introduced its preferred customer program in the third quarter of approximately  preferred customers enrolled in the preferred customer program in successful regional conventions  new product introductions and the company s price increase also contributed to sales growth in this price increase  which was phased in as part of the company s repricing strategy beginning in the third quarter of  accounted for less than of net sales in approximately of the sales growth in resulted from growth in the canadian operations

cost of sales increased to million in  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to in from in the increase in cost of sales can be attributed primarily to sales growth  a modest increase in the underlying cost of materials with no accompanying price increase until the third quarter of  and inefficiencies associated with new product introduction and product preparation for international growth 
in addition  the company established a provision for inventory obsolescence of  in to offset the risk of potential inventory obsolescence attributed to new product introduction and the modification of existing products 
distributor incentives 
distributor incentives increased to million in  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of net sales  distributor incentives increased to in from in the increase in distributor incentives was attributable primarily to increased sales growth 
two other factors contributed to the increase in distributor incentives the maturation of the distributor network  and an increase in the leadership bonus payout from to of total sales volume points generated 
the increase in distributor incentives was partially offset by a decrease in the proportion of sales volume points to total sales that resulted from the introduction of the company s repricing strategy in the third quarter of although total distributor incentives increased in  distributor incentives declined as a percentage of net sales in both the third and the fourth quarter of compared to the third and four quarters of selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed primarily to two factors 
first  variable selling  general and administrative expenses such as discount fees on credit cards and higher customer service staffing levels increased to accommodate the demands of sales growth and the increased number of distributors and preferred customers 
second  as a result of substantial investments in computer and production equipment in late and throughout  depreciation and amortization expenses as a component of selling  general and administrative expense increased by more than  in compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in  an increase of  from  in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in from in increases in research and development expenses in were primarily the result of new product development and  to a lesser extent  the reformulation of existing products 
net earnings 
net earnings increased to million in  an increase of million from million in the increase in net earnings is primarily the result of higher sales 
the company s profit margin was in  a decrease of from in the decrease in the company s profit margin can be attributed to increases in cost of sales  distributor incentives  and selling  general and administrative expenses relative to net sales 
diluted earnings per share increased to in  compared to in quarterly financial information and seasonality the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the company s last eight quarters as well as certain of such data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
this information has been prepared by the company on a basis consistent with the company s consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
the company s quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the company believes that the impact of seasonality on its results of operations is not material  although historically growth has been slower in the fourth quarter of each year 
this could change as new markets are opened and become a more significant part of the company s business 
in addition  the significant growth experienced by the company since its inception has made it difficult to accurately determine seasonal trends

all other quarters in the table represent week quarters 
the company may experience variations on a quarterly basis in its results of operations  in response to  among other things the timing of company sponsored distributor events new product introductions the opening of new markets the timing of holidays  especially in the fourth quarter  which may reduce the amount of time distributors spend selling the company s products or recruiting new distributors the adverse effect of distributors or the company s failure  or allegations of their failure  to comply with applicable governmental regulations the negative impact of changes in or interpretations of regulations that may limit or restrict the sale of certain of the company s products the operation of its network marketing system fluctuations in currency exchange rates the recruiting and retention of distributors the integration and operation of new information technology systems the inability of the company to introduce new products or the introduction of new products by the company s competitors availability of raw materials general conditions in the nutritional supplement  personal care and weight management industries or the network marketing industry consumer perceptions of the company s products and operations because the company s products are ingested by consumers or applied to their bodies  the company is highly dependent upon consumers perception of the safety  quality and efficacy of its products 
as a result  substantial negative publicity  whether founded or unfounded  concerning one or more of the company s products or other products similar to the company s products could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors the company s quarterly revenues  expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its revenues in future periods or be able to sustain its level of revenue or its rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
furthermore  no assurances can be given that the company s revenue growth rate in new markets where operations have not commenced will follow this pattern 
due to the foregoing factors  the company s future results of operations could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of the common stock of the company would likely be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth primarily from cash flows from operations 
in  the company generated net cash from operations of million compared to million in cash and cash equivalents were flat at million at both january  and december  working capital was million at january  compared to million at december  the company does not extend credit to its customers  but requires payment prior to shipping  which eliminates significant receivables 
the company invested million in property and equipment in compared to million in the company invested approximately three million dollars in land  building and improvements in the united kingdom in this  square foot facility contains a warehouse  administrative offices  a retail store for distributors and preferred customers  and a call center to service orders from england  scotland  wales and northern ireland 
inventory increased million to million at january  from million at december  the increase in inventory can primarily be attributed to the commencement of operations in the australia new zealand and united kingdom markets  including the extended transit times of shipments to these markets 
as of january   the company had invested approximately million to fund operations in the united kingdom 
at january  the company had million available under its line of credit which expires may  the interest rate is computed at the bank s prime rate  or at the option of the company  the libor base rate plus 
certain receivables  inventories  and equipment collateralize the line of credit 
the line of credit agreement also contains restrictive covenants requiring the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of january   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit as of january  a significant percentage of the company s net sales are generated from the sale of products outside the united states 
the company intends to continue to expand its foreign operations 
the company is exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in us laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
in addition  the company s results of operations and the value of its foreign assets are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which may favorably or adversely affect reported earnings and  accordingly  the comparability of period to period results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which the company and foreign competitors sell their products in the same market 
sales outside the united states represented   and of the company s net sales in   and  respectively 
the company enters into forward and option contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
transaction hedging activities seek to protect operating results and cash flows from the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
the company believes that its current cash balances  the available line of credit and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to cover its needs in the ordinary course of business for the next months 
in the event the company experiences an adverse operating environment or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms 
the company may also require or seek additional financing  including through the sale of its equity securities to finance future expansion into new markets  finance capital acquisitions associated with the growth of the company and for other reasons 
any financing which involves the sale of equity securities or instruments convertible into such securities could result in immediate and possibly significant dilution to existing shareholders 
year issues the company is aware of the risks associated with the operation of information technology and non information technology systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  with the possibility that it will affect many technology systems and is the result of the rollover of the two digit year value from to 
systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is in the process of assessing its state of readiness  including the readiness of third parties with which the company interacts  with respect to the year problem 
the assessment will also include an evaluation of the costs to the company to correct year problems related to its own systems  which  if uncorrected  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
as a part of this assessment  the company will also determine the known risks related to the consequences of failure to correct any year problems identified by the company and contingency plans  if any  that should be adopted by the company should any identified year problems not be corrected 
the company will use  if necessary  both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace and test its software for year acceptability 
however  if such modifications or conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year problem could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own problems 
independent of the year problem  the company determined in late that the purchase and installation of an enterprise resource planning system erp system could assist in achieving overall efficiencies 
the erp system will replace all of the company s existing resource planning systems except for the distribution system 
the company has begun installing the erp system and expects the installation to be complete during the third quarter of the third party vendor of the erp system has certified that its software is year compliant according to the information technology association of america 
therefore  assuming the successful installation of the erp system  the company does not expect any material year compliance issues related to its primary internal business information systems 
the company intends to replace the distribution system with two new systems in and to integrate it with the erp system 
with respect to third party providers whose services are critical to the company  the company intends to monitor the efforts of such providers as they become year compliant 
the company is presently not aware of any year issues that have been encountered by any such third party  which could materially affect the company s operations 
based on the most recent assessment  the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  any year problems that it may have with its own systems can be mitigated 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience operational difficulties as a result of year issues  either arising out of internal operations  or caused by third party service providers  which individually or collectively could have an adverse impact on business operations or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its historical operations or profitability 
outlook management believes net sales will continue to grow at a double digit rate in  although at a slower rate than in prior years 
increases in net sales will be driven by continued growth in existing markets as well as the potential opening of new international markets 
according to the nutrition business journal  the nutritional industry in the united states will grow at an annual rate of approximately over the next three years 
this does represent a slower rate of industry growth than in prior years 
management believes that network marketing provides a channel of distribution that offers opportunities for rapid international expansion with a low cost of entry relative to other channels in the nutritional industry 
double digit sales growth in is dependent upon a strong nutritional industry and success in new international markets 
if the recent industry slowdown continues or the company s new markets fail to meet management s expectations  the company may experience downward pressure on its net sales 
management believes that cost of sales as a percentage of net sales will remain relatively constant in when compared to levels 
although additional duties and taxes relating to product exports may result in higher cost of sales  management believes that increases in production efficiencies will offset the negative impact of increased duties and taxes 
to the extent the company opens additional international markets in  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales will temporarily increase 
this increase results from a higher initial demand in new markets for distributor kits  which have a significantly lower gross profit margin than other products sold by the company 
the company may experience capacity constraints in its production operations if sales grow at a greater rate than in prior years  which would result in higher cost of sales 
management believes distributor incentives as a percentage of net sales will be approximately in the company closely monitors the amount of distributor incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may from time to time adjust its distributor compensation plan to prevent distributor incentives from having a significant adverse affect on earnings  while continuing to maintain an appropriate incentive for its distributors 
the company continues pricing its products to achieve a desired contribution margin sales less cost of sales less distributor incentives and will make necessary changes to operate in this range 
management believes that selling  general and administrative expenditures will increase modestly as a percentage of net sales during when compared to levels 
this increase can be attributed to several factors increased depreciation and amortization levels resulting from strategic investments in computer and telecommunications equipment  standard start up costs related to international expansion  market research for future international expansion  and increased costs associated with building an infrastructure to achieve the company s strategic objectives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company conducts its business in several countries and intends to continue to expand its foreign operations 
the net sales are affected by fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  the operations of the company are exposed to significant risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in us laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may favorably or adversely affect the company s reported earnings and  accordingly  the comparability of its period to period results of operations 
changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which the company and foreign competitors sell their products in the same market 
when the value of the us dollar is high in comparison with the other currencies in which sales are made  this will have a negative impact on net sales 
additionally  if the dollar weakens against currencies in which the company incurs or is required to pay expenses  this will have a negative impact on net sales 
to protect against these risks  the company enters into forward and option contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
transaction hedging activities seek to protect operating results and cash flows from the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
the company believes that its cash management and investment policies have minimized theses risks 
however  there can be no assurance that these practices will be successful in eliminating all or substantially all of the risks encountered by the company in connection with its foreign currency transactions 
forward looking statements and certain risks affecting the company the statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act 
these statements regard the company s expectations  hopes  beliefs  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
they may be identified by the use of words or phrases such as believes  expects  anticipates  should  plans  estimates  and potential  among others 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s financial performance  revenue and expense levels in the future and the sufficiency of its existing assets to fund future operations and capital spending needs 
actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in such forward looking statements or for the reasons discussed below 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to the company s past reports filed with the securities and exchange commission means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
the company believes that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which the company operates and competes and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are made as of the date of this report and the company assumes no obligation to update them or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in such forward looking statements 
among others  risks and uncertainties that may affect the business  financial condition  performance  development  and results of operations of the company include the following the company relies on non employee  independent distributors to purchase  market and sell its products 
the company distributes its products through distributors 
these distributors are independent contractors who purchase products directly from the company for their own use or for resale 
distributors typically work at the distribution of the company s products on a part time basis and may and likely will engage in other business activities  some of which may compete with the company 
the company has a large number of distributors and a relatively small corporate staff to implement its marketing programs and provide motivational support to its distributors 
the company undertakes no effort to provide individual training to its distributors 
distributors may voluntarily terminate their agreements with the company at any time 
there is typically significant turnover in distributors from year to year 
because of this high turnover  the company must continually recruit new distributors 
the company s net sales are directly dependent upon the efforts of these non employee  independent distributors and future growth in sales volume will depend in large part upon the company s success in increasing the number of new distributors and improving productivity of its distributors 
consequently  the loss of a key distributor or group of distributors  large turnovers or decreases in the size of the distributor force  seasonal or other decreases in purchase volume  sales volume reduction and the costs associated with training new distributors and other related expenses may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company s ability to continue to attract and retain distributors can be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of the company  including general business and economic conditions  public perceptions about network marketing programs  high visibility investigations or legal proceeding against network marketing companies by federal or state authorities or private citizens  and public perceptions about the value and efficacy of nutritional  personal care or weight management products generally 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain distributors in numbers sufficient to sustain the company s future growth or to maintain present growth levels  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not directly control the independent acts of its distributors 
the company s distributors are required to sign and adhere to the company s distributor application and agreement  which obligates them to abide by usana policies and procedures 
although these policies and procedures prohibit distributors from making certain claims regarding the company s products or income potential from the distribution of those products  distributors may from time to time create promotional materials or otherwise provide information that does not accurately describe the company s marketing program 
they also may make statements regarding potential earnings  product claims or other matters in violation of the company s policies or applicable laws and regulations concerning these matters 
such violations may result in legal action by regulatory agencies 
future legal actions against distributors or others associated with the company could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the company and its network marketing system 
the company takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable steps to monitor distributor activities to guard against misrepresentation and other illegal or unethical conduct by distributors and to assure that the terms of its compensation plan are observed 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s efforts in this regard will be sufficient to accomplish this objective 
publicity resulting from such distributor activities can also make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain distributors and may have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
network marketing is subject to intense government scrutiny and regulation 
network marketing systems such as the company s are frequently subject to laws and regulations directed at ensuring that product sales are made to consumers of the products and that compensation  recognition and advancement within the marketing organization are based on the sale of products rather than investment in the sponsoring company 
in the united states  these laws and regulations include the federal and state securities laws  the regulation of the offer and sale of franchises and business opportunities  regulations and statutes administered by the ftc and various state anti pyramid and business opportunity laws that target direct selling businesses that promise quick rewards for little or no effort  require high entry costs  use high pressure recruiting methods or do not involve legitimate products 
similar laws govern the company s activities in foreign countries where it presently has operations or may have operations in the future 
the company is subject to the risk that  in one or more of its present or future markets  its marketing system could be found not to comply with these laws and regulations or may be prohibited 
failure by the company to comply with these laws and regulations or such a prohibition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further the company may simply be prohibited from distributing its products through a network marketing channel in some foreign countries 
the company s business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity and negative public perception 
the company s ability to attract and retain distributors and to sustain and enhance sales through its distributors can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding the company or its competitors 
this negative public perception may include publicity regarding the legality of network marketing  the quality or efficacy of nutritional supplement products or ingredients in general or the company s products or ingredients specifically  and regulatory investigations of the company or its competitors or other network marketing companies and their products  or distributor actions 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to adverse publicity or negative public perception in the future or that such adverse publicity will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company relies heavily on its key management personnel 
the company depends on the services of its founder  dr 
wentz  who serves as president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and its other executive officers 
dr 
wentz is a highly visible spokesman for the company and its products  and the company believes its success depends in large part on the continued visibility and reputation of dr 
wentz  which helps distinguish the company from its competitors 
dr 
wentz is not a permanent resident of the united states and will likely spend no more than four months per year in the united states  however he intends to devote a majority of his time to the company s business and expects to travel outside the united states to direct and promote the company s international expansion 
the loss or limitation of dr 
wentz s services as the lead spokesman for the company and its products  as a key developer of those products or as an executive officer of the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s executive officers other than dr 
wentz are primarily responsible for the company s day to day operations  and the company believes its success depends in part on its ability to retain its executive officers and to continue to attract additional qualified individuals to its management team 
the company does not maintain a key man life insurance policy on dr 
wentz or any of its other officers  nor does it have an employment agreement with any of its officers other than gilbert a 
fuller  vice president of finance and chief financial officer 
the loss or limitation of the services of any of the company s executive officers or the inability of the company to attract additional qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the ownership of a significant amount of the company s common stock gives dr 
wentz effective control of the company 
gull holdings  ltd  which is solely owned and controlled by dr 
wentz  owns approximately of the company s common stock outstanding 
consequently  dr 
wentz has effective control of the company  including the ability to elect a majority of the board of directors of the company 
similarly  dr 
wentz is in a position to effectively control decisions to adopt  amend or repeal the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws and prevent a takeover of the company by one or more third parties  or sell or otherwise transfer his stock to a third party  which could deprive the company s stockholders of a premium that might otherwise be realized by them in connection with an acquisition of the company 
the products and manufacturing activities of the company are subject to extensive government regulation 
the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the company s products under the fdc act and regulations promulgated thereunder 
the company s products also are subject to regulation by  among others  the consumer product safety commission  the united states department of agriculture and the epa 
advertising and other forms of promotion and methods of marketing of the company s products under the ftc act are regulated by the ftc 
various state and local agencies as well as those of each foreign country in which the company distributes products also regulate the manufacture  labeling and advertising of the company s products 
most of the company s products generally are regulated as dietary supplements under the fdc act and therefore are not subject to premarket approval by the fda 
however  these products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including regulation under the fdc act s adulteration and misbranding provisions 
for instance  the company is responsible for ensuring that all dietary ingredients in a supplement are safe 
the company must notify the fda in advance of placing on the market a product containing a new dietary ingredient defined as an ingredient not marketed for use as a supplement before october  and must furnish adequate information to provide reasonable assurance of the ingredient s safety 
further  if the company makes statements about a supplement s effects on the structure or function of the body  the company must  among other things  have substantiation that the statements are truthful and not misleading 
in addition  the company must ensure that its product labels bear proper ingredient and nutritional labeling and the company must manufacture its dietary supplements in accordance with current gmp s for foods 
the fda has issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to consider whether to develop specific gmp s for dietary supplements and dietary supplement ingredients 
such regulations  if promulgated  may be significantly more rigorous than current requirements and contain quality assurance requirements similar to gmp s for drug products 
the fda may remove a product from the market if it poses a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
moreover  if the fda determines that the intended use of any of the company s products is for the diagnosis  cure  mitigation  treatment or prevention of disease  the agency would consider the product a drug and would require premarket approval of safety and effectiveness prior to its manufacture and distribution 
to the extent that the intended use is a function of the claims made by the company regarding a dietary supplement  relabeling of the product to remove the offending claims may be sufficient to avoid new drug status and or compliance action by the fda 
other products manufactured by the company are regulated as cosmetics  otc drugs  and medical devices 
in general  the company s cosmetic products are not subject to premarket approval 
however  the fda does regulate cosmetics under the fdc act s adulteration and misbranding provisions 
cosmetics are also subject to specific labeling regulations  including warning statements if the safety of a cosmetic is not adequately substantiated or if the product may be hazardous  as well as ingredient statements and other packaging requirements under the fair packaging and labeling act 
cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug eg  are intended to treat or prevent disease or affect the structure or function of the body are regulated as drugs 
otc drug products may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of any otc monograph that is applicable to a drug 
drug products not conforming to the monograph requirements for otc drugs require an approved nda before marketing 
an nda requires  among other things  one or more adequate and well controlled clinical trials demonstrating the drug s safety and effectiveness before approval 
the agency has not yet promulgated final monographs for some of the company s products 
if the agency finds that an otc drug or ingredient of an otc drug marketed by the company is not generally recognized as safe and effective or does not include it in a final monograph applicable to an otc drug  the company would have to reformulate or cease marketing such a product until it is the subject of an approved nda  or until such time  if ever  that the monograph is amended to include the company s product 
whether or not an otc drug conforms to a monograph or is subject to an approved nda  such a drug must comply with other requirements under the fdc act  including gmp s  labeling  and the fdc act s misbranding and adulteration provisions 
both of the company s medical device products as currently designed and marketed do not require premarket approval or clearance by the fda 
however  one of the company s devices has been cleared for marketing under section k of the fdc act 
if a device is subject to section k  the fda must receive premarket notification from the manufacturer of its intent to market the device 
the fda must find that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device before the agency will clear the device for marketing 
in addition  modifications to the company s marketed devices will require a premarket notification and clearance under section k before the changed device may be marketed  if the change or modification could significantly affect safety or effectiveness 
all the company s devices  unless specifically exempted by regulation  are subject to the fdc act s general controls  which include among other things registration and listing  adherence to the quality system regulation requirements for manufacturing  medical device reporting and the potential for voluntary and mandatory recalls 
failure of the company to comply with applicable fda regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  injunctions  product withdrawals  recalls  product seizures  fines  and criminal prosecutions 
any such action by the fda could materially adversely affect the company s ability to successfully market its products 
the ftc regulates the advertising of the company s products under the ftc act 
section of the ftc act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce 
section of the ftc act provides that the dissemination or the causing to be disseminated of any false advertisement pertaining to  among other things  drugs  cosmetics  devices or foods  which include dietary supplements  is an unfair or deceptive act or practice 
under the ftc s substantiation doctrine  an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all product claims at the time the claims are first used in advertising or other promotions 
failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either as a deceptive or unfair practice 
pursuant to this ftc requirement  the company is required to have adequate substantiation for all advertising claims made about its products 
the type of substantiation will be dependent upon the product claims made 
for example  a health claim normally would require competent and reliable scientific evidence  while a taste claim would require only survey evidence 
in recent years  the ftc has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against dietary supplement  weight loss  and cosmetic products and companies 
if the ftc has reason to believe the law is being violated eg  the company does not possess adequate substantiation for product claims  it can initiate an enforcement action 
the ftc has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement  both administratively and judicially  including compulsory process authority  cease and desist orders and injunctions 
ftc enforcement could result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  consumer redress  divestiture of assets  rescission of contracts  and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
violation of such orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties 
any such action by the ftc could materially adversely affect the company s ability to successfully market its products 
in markets outside the united states  prior to commencing operations or marketing its products  the company may be required to obtain approvals  licenses or certifications from a country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
for example  the company s manufacturing facility has been registered with the fda and the canadian hpb and is certified by australia s tga 
approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of the company s products or may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients 
the company must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country 
these activities are also subject to regulation by various agencies or the countries in which the company s products are sold 
the company cannot predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations  or applications  nor can it determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on its business in the future 
they could include  however  requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products  additional record keeping  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  and additional scientific substantiation 
any or all such requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business expansion into foreign markets is subject to risks 
the company commenced operations in australia and new zealand in february and in the united kingdom in november the company believes that its ability to achieve future growth is dependent in part on its ability to continue its international expansion efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to grow in its existing international markets  enter new international markets on a timely basis or that such new markets will be profitable 
the company must overcome significant regulatory and legal barriers before it can begin marketing in any foreign market 
also  before marketing commences it is difficult to assess the extent to which the company s products and sales techniques will be accepted or successful in any given country 
in addition to significant regulatory barriers  the company may also encounter problems conducting operations in new markets with different cultures and legal systems from those encountered elsewhere 
the company may be required to reformulate certain of its products before commencing sales in a given country 
once the company has entered a market  it must adhere to the regulatory and legal requirements of that market 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully reformulate its products in any of the company s current or potential international markets to meet local regulatory requirements or attract local customers 
the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain and retain necessary permits and approvals or that it will have sufficient capital to finance its expansion efforts in a timely manner 
in many market areas  network marketing companies other than the company already have significant market penetration  the effect of which could be to desensitize the local distributor population to a new opportunity such as the company  or to make it more difficult for the company to recruit qualified distributors 
there can be no assurance that  even if the company is able to commence operations in foreign countries  there will be a sufficiently large population of persons inclined to participate in a network marketing system such as the company s 
the company believes its future success will depend in part on its ability to seamlessly integrate its distributor compensation plan across all markets in which the company s products are sold 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to further develop and maintain a seamless compensation program 
the company s success depends on its ability to sustain and manage growth 
the company has experienced significant growth since the management challenges encountered by the company as a result of this growth include a significant increase in the number of employees and distributors and the need to expand its facilities  acquire capital equipment and information technology systems to accommodate growth  add to and modify the company s products  and expand into new markets 
to effectively manage these and other changes resulting from growth  the company may be required to continue to hire additional management changes resulting from growth  the company may be required to continue to hire additional management and operations personnel and make additional expenditures to improve and to expand its operational  financial  information technology and management systems and its production capacity 
these requirements may significantly increase future operating expenses and reduce earnings 
no assurance can be given that the company s business will grow in the future or that the company will be able to effectively manage future growth 
the company also believes that its future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop new products 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make significant investments in research and development 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve its existing products or develop new products 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s development of new or enhanced products will be introduced in a timely manner or accepted in the marketplace 
failure by the company to develop or introduce enhanced or new products in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  any failure by the company to appropriately manage its growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the increase in distributor incentives expense reduces profitability 
since its inception  the company generally has experienced increases  as a percentage of net sales  in the amount of distributor incentives  including commissions and leadership bonuses  paid to its distributors 
from time to time the company has changed its distributor compensation plan to better manage distributor incentives 
for example  during the third quarter of  the company introduced a broad repricing strategy across its product lines  creating a spread between the price the distributor pays for the product and the sales volume point value associated with the product 
at the same time  the company changed its leadership bonus program  increasing the payout from to of total sales volume points 
management closely monitors the amount of distributor incentives paid as a percentage of net sales and may adjust its distributor compensation plan to prevent distributor incentives from having a significant adverse effect on earnings 
there can be no assurance that such changes or future changes to the distributor compensation plan or the company s pricing structure will be successful in maintaining the level of distributor incentives expense as a percentage of net sales 
furthermore  such changes may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and motivated distributors 
the company relies on and is subject to risks associated with information technology systems 
the company s success is dependent on the accuracy  reliability and proper use of sophisticated and dependable information processing systems and management information technology 
the company s information technology systems are designed and selected in order to facilitate order entry and customer billing  maintain distributor and preferred customer records  accurately track purchases and distributor incentive payments  manage accounting  finance and manufacturing operations  generate reports and provide customer service and technical support 
any interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company recognizes the need to regularly upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and distributor data base 
in the first quarter of  the company commenced installation of a new erp system 
the erp system replaces all of the company s former resource planning systems except for the company s custom programmed distributor system 
the company intends to introduce two new systems in that will replace the current distributor system 
future changes to the distributor compensation plan may require modifications of these programs or acquisition of new software 
there can be no assurance that the transition to the new software will be accomplished without interrupting the company s business or that the new software will perform in accordance with expectations  and any such delay or failure of the system would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
the company relies on the successful efforts of certain distributors 
the company s distributor compensation plan is designed to permit distributors to sponsor new distributors  creating multiple business centers  or levels in the marketing structure 
sponsored distributors are referred to as downline distributors within the sponsoring distributor s downline network 
if these downline distributors in turn sponsor new distributors  additional business centers are created  with the new downline distributors becoming part of the original sponsor s downline network 
as a result of this network marketing system  distributors develop business relationships with other distributors 
the company believes its revenue is generated by thousands of distributors 
however  the loss of a high level sponsoring distributor  together with a group of leading distributors in that person s downline  or the loss of a significant number of distributors for any reason  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the business of the company is subject to the risks associated with intense competition from larger  wealthier and more established competitors 
the company faces intense competition in the business of distributing and marketing nutritional supplements  vitamins and minerals  personal care products  weight management items  and other nutritional products 
numerous manufacturers  distributors and retailers compete actively for consumers and  in the case of other network marketing companies  for distributors 
the company competes directly with other entities that manufacture  market and distribute products in each of its product lines 
the company competes by emphasizing the underlying science  value and high quality of its products as well as the convenience and financial benefits afforded by its network marketing system 
however  many of the company s competitors are substantially larger than the company and have greater financial resources and broader name recognition 
the company s markets are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture a significant share of such markets 
the nutritional supplement market in which the company s leading products compete is characterized by a large selection of essentially similar products that are difficult to differentiate  retail consumer emphasis on value pricing  constantly changing formulations based on evolving scientific research  low entry barriers resulting from low brand loyalty  rapid change  widely available manufacturing outsourcing  low regulatory requirements  and ready access to large distribution channels  and a lack of uniform standards regarding product ingredient source  potency  purity  absorption rate and form 
similar factors are also characteristic of products comprising the company s other product lines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete in this intensely competitive environment 
in addition  nutrition  personal care and weight management products can be purchased in a wide variety of channels of distribution including retail stores 
the company s product offerings in each product category are also relatively small compared to the wide variety of products offered by many other companies 
as a result  the company s ability to remain competitive depends in part upon the successful introduction of new products 
the company is also subject to significant competition from other network marketing organizations for the time  attention and commitment of new and existing distributors 
the company s ability to remain competitive depends  in significant part  on the company s success in recruiting and retaining distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company s programs for recruiting and retaining distributors will be successful 
the pool of individuals interested in the business opportunities presented by direct selling tends to be limited in each market  and it is reduced to the extent other network marketing companies successfully recruit these individuals into their businesses 
although management believes the company offers an attractive opportunity for distributors  there can be no assurance that other network marketing companies will not be able to recruit the company s existing distributors or deplete the pool of potential distributors in a given market 
the company believes that the leading network marketing company in terms of global sales is amway corporation and its affiliates and that avon products is the leading direct seller of beauty and related products worldwide 
leading competitors in the nutritional products and nutritional direct selling markets include herbalife international  inc  nature s sunshine products  inc  rexall sundown  inc and its direct selling division rexall showcase international  inc  twinlab corporation  shaklee corporation and nuskin international  inc 
the company believes there are other manufacturers of competing product lines that may or will launch direct selling enterprises  which will compete with the company in certain of its product lines and for distributors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully meet the challenges posed by this increased competition 
the company s foreign expansion subjects it to the increased expense and risks associated with foreign duties and import restrictions 
at present  most of the company s products are manufactured in the united states and are exported to the countries in which they ultimately are sold 
the countries in which the company operates may impose various legal restrictions on imports 
in most cases  permits or licenses are required to import particular types of goods  including products of the type sold by the company 
duties of varying amounts are imposed based on the values or quantities of the goods imported 
in certain countries and jurisdictions  nutritional and other products are subject to significant import duties 
certain products that the company exports from the united states  notably products in the personal care line are subject to foreign health and safety regulations 
certain nutritional products may also be subject to governmental regulations regarding food and drugs  which regulations may limit the company s ability to sell some of its products in some countries and jurisdictions 
to date  the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining or maintaining import licenses  but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain these licenses or obtain the necessary licenses to enter new markets 
in addition  new regulations may be adopted or any of the existing regulations could be changed at any time in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
duties on imports could be changed in a manner that would be materially adverse to the company s sales and its competitive position compared to locally produced goods 
in addition  import restrictions in certain countries and jurisdictions may prevent the importation of us manufactured products altogether 
foreign operations are affected by taxation and transfer pricing considerations 
the company s principal domicile is the united states  where it is incorporated 
sales in the company s three primary markets  the united states  canada and australia new zealand  during fiscal year represented  and  respectively  of net sales 
the company is subject to taxation in the united states at an effective rate of approximately 
in addition  the company s canadian subsidiary is subject to taxation in canada at an effective rate of approximately 
tax rates applicable to operations in new zealand and australia are approximately and  respectively 
under tax treaties  the company is eligible to receive foreign tax credits in the united states for taxes actually paid abroad 
as the company s operations expand outside the united states  taxes paid to foreign taxing authorities may exceed amounts of the credits available to the company  resulting in the company s paying a higher overall effective tax rate on its worldwide operations 
the company has adopted transfer pricing agreements with its subsidiaries to regulate intercompany transfers  which agreements are subject to transfer pricing laws that regulate the flow of funds between the subsidiaries and the company for product purchases  management services and contractual obligations such as the payment of distributor incentives 
if the united states internal revenue service or the taxing authorities of any other jurisdiction were to successfully challenge these agreements or require changes in the company s transfer pricing practices  the company could become subject to higher taxes and its earnings would be adversely affected 
the company believes that it operates in compliance with all applicable foreign exchange control and transfer pricing laws 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with foreign exchange control and transfer pricing laws  or that such laws will not be modified  which  as a result  may require changes in the company s operating procedures 
foreign operations are affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
sales outside of the united states represented   and of the company s net sales in    and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its foreign operations  exposing the company to risks of changes in social  political and economic conditions in foreign countries  including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in countries where it has operations 
since a significant portion of the company s sales are in foreign countries  exchange rate fluctuations may have a significant effect on the company s sales and gross margins 
further  if exchange rates fluctuate dramatically  it may become uneconomical for the company to establish or continue activities in certain countries 
for instance  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the relative prices at which the company and foreign competitors sell their products in the same market 
as the company s business expands outside the united states  an increasing share of its net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accounting practices require that the company s non us sales and selling  general and administrative expenses be converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  the reported net earnings of the company in future periods may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  with earnings generally increasing with a weaker us dollar and decreasing with a strengthening us dollar 
product purchases from the company by its foreign subsidiaries are transacted in us dollars 
as operations expand in countries where foreign currency transactions may be made  the company s operating results will be increasingly subject to the risks of exchange rate fluctuations and the company may not be able to accurately estimate the impact of such changes on its future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies may also adversely affect the company s sales to customers outside the united states 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain commitments denominated in foreign currency  including intercompany cash transfers 
the company generally does not use derivative instruments to manage currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that such hedging transactions will protect operating results and cash flows from potentially adverse effects of currency exchange fluctuations 
such adverse effects would also adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
growth of the company s business subjects it to risks relating to expansion of facilities 
the company believes its long term competitive position depends in part on its ability to increase its manufacturing capacity 
the company expects it will be necessary to expand its manufacturing capacity  administrative offices and warehouse facilities in the failure of the company to complete the expansion on schedule and under budget could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business may be affected by risks associated with the year since its inception  the company has attempted to leverage technology  including increasingly sophisticated computer hardware and software  in managing its business and operations 
the company also relies on third parties to facilitate its business 
for example  these vendors include telecommunications providers on whom the company must rely for its call center operations  public utilities that provide electrical power and other utilities needed in the company s operations  major credit card companies that process the vast majority of payments for the company s products  major shipping companies located in the united states  canada and elsewhere through which the company ships its products to distributors  financial institutions that provide commercial banking and other financial services to the company  and the nasdaq stock market  on which the company s common stock is traded 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field and were designed  developed and modified without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  such computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year by erroneously identifying the year as  rather than correcting a year problem on a large mainframe or network application can be difficult and expensive 
if a company does not successfully address its year issues  it may face material adverse consequences 
the company is in the process of insuring that all of its internal computer systems are year compliant 
independent of those efforts  the company determined in late that the purchase and installation of an integrated erp could achieve overall efficiencies 
the erp system will replace all of the company s existing resource planning systems except for the company s distributor system 
the company has commenced installation of the erp system through a third party provider of software and consulting services  and expects the installation to be complete no later than the second quarter of fiscal the third party vendor of the erp system has represented to the company that the information technology association of america certifies the erp system as year compliant 
therefore  assuming the successful installation of the erp system  the company does not expect any material year compliance issues to arise related to its primary internal business information systems 
while the company believes its current distributor system is year compliant  it expects to replace the distributor system with two new applications in these applications are also expected to be year compliant as certified by the vendors of the systems 
there can be no assurance that the transition to these new software systems will be accomplished in a timely manner or that they will in fact be year compliant 
with respect to third party providers whose services are critical to the company  the company intends to monitor the efforts of such providers as they become year compliant 
the company is not aware of any year issues that have been encountered by any such third party  which it believes could materially affect the company s operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience operational difficulties as a result of year issues  either arising out of internal operations  or caused by third party service providers  which individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials 
the company acquires all of its raw materials for the manufacture of its products from third party suppliers 
normally  materials used in manufacturing the company s products are purchased on account or by purchase order 
the company has very few long term agreements for the supply of such materials 
there is a risk that any of the company s suppliers or manufacturers could discontinue selling their products to the company 
although the company believes that it could establish alternate sources for most of its products  any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in product shortages and back orders for the products  with a resulting loss of net sales 
for example  since the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continuing intermittently during and  the company experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of natural vitamin e powder  an ingredient required for the manufacture of several of its products 
as a consequence  the company was required to alter its products and to substitute different products from another source 
in addition  the company relies on third party manufacturers for several of its products  including its food bars and drink mixes 
the company has in the past discontinued or temporarily stopped sales of certain products manufactured by third parties while those products were on back order 
there can be no assurance that suppliers will provide the raw materials needed by the company in the quantities requested or at a price the company is willing to pay 
because the company does not control the actual production of these raw materials  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials based on conditions not within its control  including weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  strikes by supplier employees and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
the inability of the company to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials for its products at favorable prices  or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future acquisitions  if any  by the company would be subject to certain risks 
the company has not completed any acquisitions to date  but it may pursue acquisitions in the future as a part of its business strategy 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the risk that the acquired business will not perform in accordance with expectations  difficulties in the integration of the operations and products of the acquired businesses with those of the company  the diversion of the company s management attention from other aspects of the company s business  the risks associated with entering geographic and product markets where the company has limited or no direct prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business 
the acquisition of another business can also subject the company to liabilities and claims arising out of such business 
future acquisitions would likely require the company to obtain additional financing  which would likely result in an increase in the company s indebtedness or the issuance of additional capital stock  which may be dilutive to the company s stockholders 
in addition  to the extent the company has outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facility or is required to incur indebtedness thereunder to consummate an acquisition  the consent of the lender under the credit facility may be required prior to such acquisition 
additionally  the company faces significant competition for acquisition opportunities from numerous companies  many of which have greater financial resources than the company 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to the company or that the company will be able to obtain financing or otherwise consummate any future acquisitions 
nutritional supplement products may be supported by only limited availability of conclusive clinical studies 
the company s products include nutritional supplements that are made from vitamins  minerals  herbs and other substances for which there is a long history of human consumption 
some of the company s products contain innovative ingredients or combinations of ingredients 
although the company believes all of its products to be safe when taken as directed  there is little long term experience with human consumption of certain of these product ingredients or combinations of ingredients in concentrated form 
the company conducts research tests the formulation and production of its products  but the company has performed or sponsored only limited clinical studies 
furthermore  because the company is highly dependent on consumers perception of the efficacy  safety and quality of its products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies  the company could be adversely affected in the event such products should prove or be asserted to be ineffective or harmful to consumers or in the event of adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from consumers use or misuse of the company s products or similar products 
manufacturers such as the company may be subject to product liability claims 
as a manufacturer and distributor of products for human consumption and topical application  the company could become exposed to product liability claims and litigation to prosecute such claims 
additionally  the manufacture and sale of such products involves the risk of injury to consumers as a result of tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
to date  the company has not been party to any product liability litigation  although certain individuals have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using the company s nutritional products 
these matters historically have been settled to the satisfaction of the company and have not to date resulted in material payments by the company 
the company is aware of no instance in which any of its products are or have been defective in any way that could give rise to material losses or expenditures related to product liability claims 
although the company maintains product liability insurance which it believes to be adequate for its needs  there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to claims in the future or that its insurance coverage will be adequate or that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage 
the company is subject to risks associated with general economic conditions 
usana s products are priced at a premium compared to most nutritional  personal care and weight management products that are readily available at retail outlets 
a recession in the general economy or a decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance of future industry growth 
market data referred to in this report regarding the size and projected growth rates of the market for nutritional supplements generally indicate that this market is large and growing 
however  there can be no assurance that such market is as large as reported or that such projected growth will occur or continue 
market data and projections such as those presented in this report are inherently uncertain  subject to change and generally not available for and in addition  the underlying market conditions are subject to change based on economic conditions  consumer preferences and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
an adverse change in size or growth rate of the market for nutritional supplements is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to particular intellectual property risks 
the company owns no patents  has filed no patent applications and does not intend in the immediate future to file a patent application covering any of the formulations of its nutritional or other products 
the labeling regulations governing the company s nutritional supplements require that the ingredients of such products be precisely and accurately indicated on product containers 
accordingly  patent protection for nutritional supplements often is impractical  if not impossible  given the large number of manufacturers who produce nutritional supplements having many active ingredients in common 
additionally  the nutritional supplement industry is characterized by rapid change and frequent reformulations of products as the body of scientific research and literature refines current understanding of the application and efficacy of certain substances and interactions among various substances 
in this respect  the company maintains an active research and development program that is devoted to developing better  purer and more effective formulations of its nutritional products 
the company protects its investment in research  as well as the techniques it uses to improve the purity and effectiveness of its products by relying on trade secret laws  although it has not to date entered into confidentiality agreements with certain of its employees involved in research and development activities 
additionally  the company endeavors to seek  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  trademark and trade dress protection for its products  which protection has been sought in the united states  canada and many of the other countries in which the company is either presently operating or plans to commence operations in the near future 
the company s research and development efforts may at some future time result in patentable products  in which case patents would be sought  however  no assurance can be given that patents would be obtained 
notwithstanding the company s efforts as described above  there can be no assurance that such efforts to protect its trade secrets and trademarks will be successful 
nor can there be any assurance that third parties will not assert claims against the company for infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
if an infringement claim is asserted  the company may be required to obtain a license of such rights  pay royalties on a retrospective or prospective basis or terminate its manufacturing and marketing of its products alleged to have infringed 
litigation with respect to such matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
for example  since the company has been engaged in defending litigation involving  among other things  claims of patent infringement relating to a key ingredient in one of its most popular products 
although the company disputes the claims of the plaintiff in this case  the litigation has continued for more than two years and the company has expended approximately  in its defense of such claims 
an adverse ruling in the case could have materially adverse effects on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
production of the company s products has not ever been adversely affected by the unavailability of raw materials as a result of infringement or other similar claims or royalty claims from third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that such third party claims will not in the future adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s manufacturing activity is subject to certain risks 
the company s results of operations are dependent upon the continued operation of its manufacturing facility in salt lake city  utah 
the operation of a nutritional supplement manufacturing facility involves many risks  including power failures  the breakdown  failure or substandard performance of equipment  the improper installation or operation of equipment  natural or other disasters and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of government agencies  including the fda 
there can be no assurance that the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at the company s facility would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials 
the company s manufacturing operations presently do not result in the generation of material amounts of hazardous or toxic substances 
nevertheless  complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or more vigorous enforcement of current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures by the company and could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and regulations require the company to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in its processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require the company to halt one or more portions of its operations until a violation is cured 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s stock price is subject to volatility 
the trading price of the common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the quarter to quarter variations in the company s operating results  material announcements by the company or its competitors  governmental regulatory action  conditions in the nutritional supplement industry or other events or factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s operating results in future quarters may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
in addition  the stock market has historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market prices of many nutritional supplement companies and network marketing companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
moreover  the company s common stock may be even more prone to volatility than the securities of other businesses in similar industries in light of the relatively small number of shares of common stock not held by affiliates 
given such a relatively small public float  there can be no assurance that the prevailing market prices of common stock will not be artificially inflated or deflated by trading even on relatively small amounts of common stock
