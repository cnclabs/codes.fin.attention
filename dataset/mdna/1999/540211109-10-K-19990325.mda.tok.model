however  if the company s plans or assumptions change  if its assumptions prove to be inaccurate or if the company experiences unanticipated costs or competitive pressures  the company may be required to seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain financing  or  if such financing is available  that the company will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
failure to obtain additional financing  if needed  could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s expansion plans 
year information the company is engaged in a comprehensive review of internal computer systems and software and external business relationships in regard to year issues 
state of readiness 
the company has a project team comprised of key members from cross organization departments 
the team s objectives are to gather information and facilitate research on year issues that could affect the company  and to take necessary actions to eliminate or minimize the impact of such issues 
internally  the company has nearly completed its efforts to identify the computer hardware and software that is used both at its in house facilities as well as at its hotel properties 
research and testing of these systems for year compliance is underway 
the company expects to substantially complete its research and testing of internal computer hardware and software by the end of the second quarter of correction or replacement of hardware and software containing year issues is in progress and is estimated for completion by the end of the third quarter of externally  the company is working to identify third party business relationships that are impacted by the year issue 
research and review of these relationships is underway including contacting the third parties to solicit information and assurances relating to potential year issues and reviewing responses 
the company expects to complete its review of third party relationships by the end of the second quarter of  although no assurance can be given as to the year remediation of third parties 
costs associated with year issues 
incremental costs are expected to be comprised primarily of costs to purchase software upgrades and hardware 
additionally  external consulting  programming and training costs may be incurred 
estimated costs of year compliance are not fully determined at this time 
the company expects to incur less than  in aggregate out of pocket costs in and to complete its year compliance program  excluding the cost of internal staffing 
as of december   the company has incurred out of pocket costs totaling  toward year compliance efforts 
such funds have been provided from the company s bank credit facility 
although the company intends to develop and implement  if necessary  appropriate contingency plans to mitigate to the extent possible the effects of any year noncompliance  such plans may not be adequate and the cost of year compliance may be greater than  lodgenet entertainment corporation form k risks associated with year issues 
the company is highly dependent upon its own information technology systems and those of its suppliers and customers 
the company s or a third party s failure to correct a material year problem could result in a failure of or interruption in the company s business activities and operations 
such interruptions and failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company s year project is expected to reduce significantly the company s level of uncertainty and the possibility of significant or long lasting interruptions of the company s business operations  however  the company believes that it is impossible to predict all of the areas in which material problems may arise 
contingency plans 
the company has not yet completed specific contingency plans for year issues 
the company is in the process of identifying the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios  so that it may attempt to secure alternate vendors and service providers for these functions as well as to develop alternative systems which could be used to process data 
while the company anticipates achieving year compliance in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that all processes will be compliant  that there will be no significant delay or loss of revenues  or that no material supply sources will be interrupted 
however  the company believes that its planning and action efforts will help reduce any loss or disruption 
market risk disclosures the company s bank credit facility described in note to the financial statements as well as in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this facility are subject to interest rates based on the lender s base rate of either the prime interest rate or the eurodollar rate 
should the lender s base rate change  the company s interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   the company had borrowed approximately million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  a increase in the lender s base interest rate would cost the company  in additional gross interest expense on an annual basis
