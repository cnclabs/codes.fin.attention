the million revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain prescribed debt service coverage  liquidity and capital expenditure reserve levels at certain of its communities and a financial covenant requiring a minimum net worth level for the company 
all of the company s owned communities are subject to mortgages  seven of which serve as blanket collateral for the indebtedness payable to a capital corporation and as collateral for the million revolving credit facility

there can be no assurance that financing from such sources will be available in the future or  if available  that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
year the company has assessed the impact of year issues on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
the majority of the company s critical information systems were purchased from outside vendors who have upgraded their applications to be year compliant 
the company anticipates substantially completing the testing of its information systems by the second quarter of the company is also evaluating other year implications associated with its community operations  such as elevators  security systems  hvac systems  utilities and other major services or supplies 
the company anticipates substantially completing the remediation of such systems and services by the second quarter of the potential impact of year issues is also dependent upon corrective measures taken by the businesses and other entities that the company deems critical to its operations 
communication with significant third parties has been initiated to determine the status of their year compliance  however  it is not possible  at present  to determine the effect on the company if third party remediation efforts are not completed in a timely manner 
while the company expects to adequately resolve all year issues  a reasonably likely worst case scenario could include supplier disruption and potential delay in reimbursement from certain agencies 
the company intends to address the possible consequences of these issues through community specific supplier contingency plans and a prudent level of liquidity 
the company is unable to quantify the potential effect of year issues on its results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
the total cost of compliance measures is not estimated to be material and is being funded through operating cash flows and expensed as incurred 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
inflation could  however  affect the company s future revenues and results of operations because of  among other things  the company s dependence on senior residents  many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  during inflationary periods  the company may not be able to increase resident service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures
