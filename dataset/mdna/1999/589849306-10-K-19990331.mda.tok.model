the north american business as defined below produced approximately billion  billion  and billion in revenues for  and  respectively 
former operations as defined below produced approximately million and billion in revenues for and  respectively 
because the north american business now represents the ongoing business of the company  the following discussion and analysis will compare the results of operations solely for the north american business unless otherwise indicated

the company is also continuing efforts to improve the controls and management supervision over margin management related activities such as sales execution and processes 
however  the company continues to face intense competitive pricing pressures  which escalated during the fourth quarter of and continue to persist

us sales growth was lower in the first half of the year and for the first and second quarters  respectively despite double digit rates of growth in moca tm and var sales 
this was partially related to declines in retail sales  which reflected the company s decision to substantially reduce its retail sales activities in early  in part to address liquidity issues and constraints

systems and processes merisel has made significant investments in new  advanced computer and warehouse management systems for its north american operations to support sales growth and improve service levels 
all of merisel s nine north american warehouses now utilize merisel s information and logistical efficiency system miles  a computerized warehouse management system  which uses infrared bar coding and advanced computer hardware and software to maintain high picking  receiving and shipping accuracy rates 
merisel is in the process of converting its us operations to the sap client server operating system 
the company plans to convert its us operations to the sap system during the second quarter of the company converted its canadian operations from a mainframe to the sap client server operating system in august sap is an enterprise wide system which integrates all functional areas of the business including order entry  inventory management and finance in a real time environment 
the new system is designed to provide greater transaction functionality  automated controls  flexibility  and custom pricing applications 
the design and implementation of these new systems are complex projects and involve certain risks 
the us sap implementation in particular  because of its scope and complexity  involves risks that could have a material adverse impact on operations and financial results  particularly during the quarter in which the implementation occurs 
among other things  the implementation of the sap system in the us may result in delays and other unanticipated interruptions that could adversely affect the company s business 
year issues introduction the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other equipment as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that computers and equipment have historically used two digit fields that recognize dates using the assumption that the first two digits are 
on january   systems using two digit date fields could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year year project and the company s state of readiness the company believes that implementation of the sap operating system will address its major year issues for its core information technology it systems 
see systems and processes above 
the company has developed a plan for addressing the remainder of its year issues which focuses on the following six areas core it systems  off line it subsystems  technical infrastructure eg  networks  servers  desktop computers  vendor customer interfaces consisting of electronic data interchange or edi  facilities including security systems  elevators  and heating and cooling systems  and third party suppliers  vendors and customers external parties 
for the first five areas  the company s year plan consists of the following phases conducting an inventory of items with year implications  assessment of year compliance  remediation or replacement of material items that are determined not to be year compliant  testing including re testing of material items that were remediated or replaced  and certification of year compliancy 
the company has completed the inventory phase with respect to all areas 
the assessment phase is substantially completed and the remediation and testing phases are in process and are scheduled to be substantially completed during the second quarter of  with a limited amount of remediation completed during the third quarter of in addition  the company intends to conduct integration testing during the early part of the third quarter of the company currently plans to complete the year project by the beginning of the fourth quarter of costs the company currently estimates that the aggregate cost of its year project will be approximately million  although the total amount could be greater 
less than  had been spent through the end of the aggregate cost estimate excludes the cost of implementing the sap operating system in the us and costs incurred pursuant to the company s technology upgrade strategy where the upgrades were not accelerated due to year issues 
in addition  a portion of the estimated total costs of the year project will be funded by reallocation of existing resources rather than incurring incremental costs 
this reallocation of resources is not expected to have a significant impact of the day to day operations of the company  including any material effect on the implementation of any it project 
the company s aggregate cost estimate does not include costs that may be incurred by the company as a result of the failure of any third parties  including suppliers  to become year ready or costs to implement any contingency 
the year project costs will be expensed by the company as incurred 
risks the company believes that the completion of its year project and the implementation of the sap operating system in the us as planned will result in the company being year compliant in a timely manner 
however  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations  which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  if third parties that provide goods or services that are critical to the company s business activities fail to adequately address their year issues  there could be a similar material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario is the failure of such a third party 
such a failure could result in  for example  the inability of the company to ship product  a telecommunications failure at one or more of the company s call centers  a decrease in customer orders  delays in product deliveries from vendors or power outages at one or more of the company s facilities 
the company s year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of material external parties 
the company believes that  with the completion of its year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
contingency plans as part of the company s year project  year specific contingency plans are being developed 
the company expects that these plans will continue to be modified as the company obtains additional information regarding the company s internal systems and equipment during the remediation and testing phases of its year program and regarding the status of the year readiness of external parties 
the company expects these plans to be finalized by the date of completion of all other areas of the year project 
in addition  as a normal course of business  the company maintains and deploys contingency plans as part of its disaster recovery program that are designed to address various other potential business interruptions 
these plans may be applicable to address the failure of external parties to provide goods or services to the company as a result of their failure to be year ready 
during  the company intends to expand its disaster recovery program to cover systems for which detailed contingency plans do not currently exist 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained under year issues should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading special note regarding forward looking information on page ii 
variability of quarterly results and seasonality historically  the company has experienced variability in its net sales and operating margins on a quarterly basis and expects these patterns to continue in the future 
management believes that the factors influencing quarterly variability include i the overall growth in the computer industry  ii shifts in short term demand for the company s products resulting  in part  from the introduction of new products or updates of existing products  iii the intensity of price competition among the company and its competitors as influenced by various factors  and iv the fact that virtually all sales in a given quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
in addition  quarterly variability could be affected by the year issue by shifting demand for computer products during and future years 
due to the factors noted above  as well as the dynamic characteristics of the computer product distribution industry  the company s revenues and earnings may be subject to material volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
additionally  in the us and canada  the company s net sales in the fourth quarter have been historically higher than in its other three quarters 
management believes that the pattern of higher fourth quarter sales is partially explained by customer buying patterns relating to calendar year end business and holiday purchases 
as a result of this pattern  the company s working capital requirements in the fourth quarter have typically been greater than other quarters 
net sales in the canadian operations are also historically strong in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
this is primarily due to buying patterns of canadian government agencies

debt obligations  financing sources and capital expenditures at december   merisel  inc had outstanding  principal amount of the notes 
the notes provide for an interest rate of payable semi annually 
by virtue of being an obligation of merisel  inc  the notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the company s subsidiaries  including trade payables  and are not guaranteed by any of the company s subsidiaries 
the indenture relating to the notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit the type and amount of additional indebtedness that may be incurred by the company or any of its subsidiaries and imposes limitations on investments  loans  advances  asset sales or transfers  dividends and other payments  the creation of liens  sale leasebacks  transactions with affiliates and certain mergers 
at december   the company had promissory notes outstanding with an aggregate balance of  such notes provide for interest at the rate of approximately per annum and are repayable in and monthly installments that commenced february   with balloon payments due at maturity

this assumes  however  that there are not material adverse changes in the company s relationships with its vendors  customers or lenders 
any unforeseen event that adversely impacts the industry or the company s position in the industry could have a direct and material unfavorable effect on the liquidity of the company 
inflation due to the short term nature of merisel s contracts and agreements with customers and vendors  the company does not believe that inflation had a material impact on its operations 
asset management merisel attempts to manage its inventory position to maintain levels sufficient to achieve high product availability and same day order fill rates 
inventory levels may vary from period to period  due to factors including increases or decreases in sales levels  merisel s practice of making large volume purchases when it deems such purchases to be attractive  and the addition of new manufacturers and products 
the company has negotiated agreements with many of its manufacturers that contain stock balancing and price protection provisions intended to reduce  in part  merisel s risk of loss due to slow moving or obsolete inventory or manufacturer price reductions 
the company is not assured that these agreements will succeed in reducing this risk 
in the event of a manufacturer price reduction  the company generally receives a credit for products in inventory 
in addition  the company has the right to return a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock return privileges  as well as the company s inventory management procedures  have helped to reduce the risk of loss of carrying inventory 
in the past year  however  certain computer systems manufacturers that are among the company s largest vendors have announced changes in price protection and other terms and conditions that could adversely affect the company 
the company is working closely with these manufacturers and has developed buying procedures and controls to manage inventory purchases to reduce the potential adverse impact from these changes while balancing the need to maintain sufficient levels of inventory 
there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in preventing a material adverse effect on the company 
the company purchases exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange transaction gains and losses

these programs include floor plan financing and hardware and software leasing 
with respect to credit sales  the company attempts to control its bad debt exposure by monitoring customers creditworthiness and  where practicable  through participation in credit associations that provide customer credit rating information for certain accounts 
in addition  the company purchases credit insurance as it deems appropriate
