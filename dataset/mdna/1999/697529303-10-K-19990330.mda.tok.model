item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a overview on december   the company entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the agreement with coherent  inc coherent to sell all of the issued and outstanding common stock of star medical technologies  inc star  its majority owned subsidiary  to coherent for million in cash 
the company currently owns substantially all of the issued and outstanding common shares of star 
however  options that have been granted to palomar and employees of star to purchase shares of star s common stock remain outstanding 
when all of the outstanding options under star s stock option plan have been exercised  the company will own of star s common stock and the employees will collectively own at the time of the sale of star 
therefore  the company anticipates that it will receive net proceeds from this sale of approximately million after taxes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of the agreement  the company will also receive an ongoing royalty of from coherent on the sale of any products by coherent that employ certain patented technology related to laser hair removal currently licensed by the company on an exclusive basis from massachusetts general hospital mgh see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the sale is subject to stockholder approval  as well as customary closing conditions 
if this transaction is consummated  revenues would decline significantly in the near term and the successful introduction and marketing of new products will become more critical to the company s long term success 
a significant portion of the company s current revenue base will need to be replaced with future revenues from the company s other laser products  including the palomar etm hair removal laser introduced in february of and other products currently in development 
for the year ended december   gross revenues associated with star s lightsheer tm diode laser comprised of the company s total revenues 
there can be no assurance that the palomar etm or the company s future products will achieve market acceptance or generate sufficient margins 
broad market acceptance of laser hair removal is critical to the company s success 
the company recognizes the need and intends to broaden its product line by developing cosmetic laser products other than hair removal lasers 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the board of directors authorized management to focus the company on its core laser products and services business  principally related to laser hair removal  and to proceed with a restructuring plan to reorganize the company and divest its electronic subsidiaries  dynaco corp 
dynaco  dynamem  inc dynamem  comtel electronics  inc comtel and nexar technologies  inc 
nexar collectively  the electronic subsidiaries  and other non core businesses 
pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  the consolidated financial statements of the company have been reclassified to reflect the dispositions of the electronic subsidiaries 
accordingly  the revenues  cost and expenses  assets and liabilities and cash flows of the electronics subsidiaries have been reported as discontinued operations in these consolidated financial statements see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company has simplified its organization and now conducts business in only two locations  lexington  massachusetts and pleasanton  california 
prior to this restructuring  the company conducted business in over a dozen different locations 
b results i revenues and gross margin year ended december   compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   the company s revenues increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the company s revenue of million or from the year ended december  was mainly due to additional sales volume of million associated with the introduction of the lightsheer tm diode laser  partially offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately million in other cosmetic laser product revenue 
the company obtained fda clearance to market and sell its lightsheer tm laser for hair removal and leg vein treatment in the united states at the end of the decrease in sales volume associated with other cosmetic laser product revenue was principally due to declining sales of the company s epilaser r ruby laser 
the company focused on bringing the lightsheer tm laser to market while further developing a new generation of ruby hair removal lasers during using its core ruby laser technology  originally developed for tattoo and pigmented lesion removal  palomar developed its long pulse epilaser r ruby laser that is specifically configured to allow the appropriate wavelength  energy level and pulse duration to be absorbed effectively by the hair follicle without being absorbed by the surrounding tissue 
that  combined with company s patented cooling handpiece  allows safe and effective hair removal 
palomar expects its new generation long pulse ruby laser  the palomar etm  to permit more rapid treatment of large areas of the body 
in july  the company obtained fda clearance to market and sell its epilaser r laser system in the united states for permanent hair reduction 
in march of  the company also obtained fda clearance to market and sell its palomar etm laser system in the united states for permanent hair reduction 
gross margin for the year ended december  was approximately million of revenues compared to  of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin and gross margin percentage was due to sales of the lightsheer tm diode laser system 
this new laser system has a significantly higher gross margin than the company s epilaser r laser and other cosmetic products 
the company anticipates that if the sale of star is consummated  its gross margin percentage from the sale of palomar etm will decrease compared to the current gross margin from the sale of its lightsheer tm product unless and until the palomar etm achieves volume production and manufacturing efficiencies 
ii operating and other expenses year ended december   compared to year ended december  research and development costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue totaled for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decline in spending is primarily the result of the company s receipt of fda approval for the lightsheer tm laser at the end of the continued spending on research and development reflects the company s commitment to research and development for medical devices and delivery systems for cosmetic laser applications and other medical applications using a variety of lasers  while continuing dermatology research utilizing the company s ruby and diode lasers 
among the company s research and development goals in hair removal is to design systems permitting more rapid treatment of large areas  and to produce systems with high gross margins 
management believes that research and development expenditures will remain constant over the next year as the company continues product development and clinical trials for additional applications for its lasers and delivery systems in the cosmetic and dermatological markets 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million of revenues for the year ended december   from approximately million of revenues for the year ended december  the increase in selling and marketing expenses is attributable to the costs associated with the company s distribution agreement with coherent  which increase in direct proportion to sales volume see note d to the consolidated financial statements because coherent receives a commission for each of the company s products that it sells to compensate it for its selling and marketing efforts 
the amounts received by coherent as a percentage of the company s net revenues are greater than the company s selling and marketing expenses when it performed these functions internally during the company anticipates that its selling and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue after the completion of the sale of star to coherent as the company begins to sell the palomar etm through other sales channels  including distribution through continuum biomedical  a distributor of medical products 
the company also will consider establishing its own direct sales force to compliment these sales channels 
the company anticipates that its selling and marketing costs incurred through other sales channels and its own direct sales force will be less than the commissions currently earned by coherent as a percentage of the company s net revenues 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to million of revenues for the year end ended december  this decrease is attributable to the company s restructuring and consolidation of administrative functions in the third and fourth quarters of  including a reduction in costs attributable to palomar technologies  ltd  esthetica  inc formerly cosmetic technology international  inc  palomar medical products  inc 
and corporate costs totaling million  million  million and million  respectively 
this reduction was offset by an increase of  for general and administrative expenses incurred at the company s star subsidiary to support its successful introduction of its lightsheer tm laser 
in previous years  the company used management s time and allocated resources to developing businesses outside of the medical and cosmetic laser industry and financing the non core businesses 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company focused its efforts on its core business 
the company anticipates general and administrative expense will continue to stabilize in the future and after the sale of star as the company focuses on its core operations in the cosmetic laser business 
the company incurred no business development and financing costs during the year ended december  as compared to million of revenues for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the company s restructuring efforts to focus on its core medical business 
restructuring and asset write off costs were approximately million for the year ended december  these charges reflect restructuring and asset write off costs for certain operating and non operating assets that the company believes were not fully realizable for both the company s medical business and other non medical investments 
included in this charge is a million reserve for severance costs associated with consolidating selling  general and administrative functions  including the closing of certain facilities 
through december   the company paid out million of severance costs and has a remaining liability of  related to two individuals that will be paid out in  resulting in actual restructuring costs incurred of million 
accordingly  the company reversed the balance of this restructuring accrual of approximately  in its consolidated statement of operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the company did not incur settlement expenses 
settlement costs of million were incurred in the year ended december  these charges consisted mainly of a legal accrual related to a legal settlement with an investment bank 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the amount for includes million of non cash interest expense related to the value ascribed to the discount features of the convertible debentures issued by the company during and this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in convertible debenture financings and the company s increased use of conventional financing 
also  operations did not require as much financing in as compared to interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   from approximately  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in interest received due to a decrease in other loans and investments and a decrease in the company s average cash position during net gain on trading securities represents a realized gain of approximately  for the year ended december  related to the company s investment in a publicly traded company that was sold during the company does not have any marketable trading securities as of december  the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations in was due to a delay in the disposition of dynaco resulting in operating expenses of approximately million above the estimated operating expenses accrued at december  a loss on disposition of discontinued entities for the year ended december  of million was incurred 
the majority of this charge relates the write off of the company s carrying value of its investment in nexar during the second quarter of iii revenues and gross margin year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase mainly was due to additional sales volume of approximately million associated with the epilaser r hair removal laser system and service revenue and with the rd tm tattoo removal and pigmented lesion treatment laser manufactured by the company 
the company obtained fda clearance to market and sell the epilaser r laser system for hair removal in the united states in march this increase in revenues was offset by a decline of approximately million in sales volume for the company s tru pulse r co laser product 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  of revenues compared to million of revenues for the year ended december  the decline in gross margin percentage was caused mainly by lower margins attained on the company s epilaser r laser system due to manufacturing and production inefficiencies in the initial manufacturing stage of this product as well as under absorbed overhead costs incurred during the fourth quarter of as the company transitioned to its exclusive distribution arrangement with coherent 
the decline in gross margin dollars was due principally to a reduction in revenues related to the company s tru pulse r co laser product 
the company s overall strategy was to first demonstrate and prove the overall efficacy of its proprietary cosmetic hair removal technology licensed from mgh and gain early entrance to the market 
this resulted in higher than anticipated costs of materials and manufacturing techniques 
as a result of this strategy  the company believes that during it demonstrated to the medical community the efficacy of its technology and its long term benefits and advantages which led to the successful introduction and sales of its lightsheer tm laser in iv operating and other expenses year ended december   compared to year ended december  research and development costs increased to million of revenues for the year ended december   from million of revenues for the year ended december  this increase in research and development reflects the company s strategic decision to accelerate its research and development efforts during to develop and obtain fda clearance for its successor hair removal and other cosmetic products using the company s proprietary cooling technology licensed from mgh 
the company also continued to concentrate on the development of additional products for other medical laser applications 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million of revenues for the year ended december   from million of revenues for the year ended december  this increase reflected the company s effort to expand its marketing and distribution for the company s epilaser r laser system 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues for the year ended december   from million of revenues for the year ended december  this increase was the result of additional administrative resources required at the company s now closed separate corporate offices and subsidiaries to oversee the growth of the company s medical products and service businesses  the initial public offering of common stock of nexar  and divestiture efforts substantially completed during  totaling approximately  additional general and administrative costs were also incurred at palomar medical products  inc  esthetica and palomar technologies  ltd

on december   the company entered into a agreement and plan of reorganization the agreement with coherent to sell all of the issued and outstanding common stock of star  its majority owned subsidiary  to coherent 
the company currently owns substantially all of the issued and outstanding common shares of star 
however  options outstanding granted to palomar and employees of star to purchase shares of star s common stock remain outstanding 
when all of the outstanding options under star s stock option plan have been exercised  the company will own of star s common stock and the employees will collectively own 
see note to the financial statements 
under the terms of the agreement  the selling price of star is million 
in addition  the company will receive an ongoing royalty of from coherent on the sale of any products by coherent that use certain patents currently licensed by the company on an exclusive basis from massachusetts general hospital 
see note b to the financial statements 
this sale is subject to the approval of the stockholders of palomar 
the company anticipates that it will receive net proceeds of approximately million for the sale 
the company intends to use these funds to support its ongoing operations and research and development activities 
as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in order to meet its cash flow requirements and fund operating losses at its subsidiaries  the company generated million and million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and short term notes payable  respectively  during the year ended december  the company s net cash used in operating activities for the year end ended december  was approximately million which includes approximately million of net cash generated from star s operating activities 
the company s net loss for the year ended december  included approximately million of non cash depreciation and amortization expense 
as of december   the company s accounts receivable totaled million as compared to million as of december  the amount at december  is principally related to accounts receivable from the sale of star s lightsheer tm diode laser 
the company began shipping this product in the first quarter of the increase in this balance from is related to the sale of star s lightsheer tm diode laser product 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  as of december   compared to  as of december  this reduction was principally due to a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts for write offs during of certain accounts receivable related to the sales of the company s epilaser r laser systems sold in totaling approximately  and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the company sale of its lightsheer tm diode laser products during as of december  accounts payable totaled approximately million as compared to million as of december  this increase of million is principally due to the additional purchases of inventory and additional plant cost for the manufacturing of the company s lightsheer tm product during the fourth quarter of and the buildup of inventory for the anticipated sales of palomar e tm laser system 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for will total approximately million  consisting primarily of machinery  equipment and computers and peripherals 
the company expects to finance these expenditures with cash on hand  its line of credit and equipment leasing lines 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the necessary financing 
the company has a  revolving line of credit from a bank 
this revolving line of credit matures on march  and bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
borrowings are limited to of domestic accounts receivable under days from invoice 
a director of the company has personally guaranteed borrowings under the line of credit 
as of march   approximately  was available under this line of credit 
the company entered into a loan agreement with coherent  pursuant to which coherent agreed to loan the company money to help finance the company s working capital requirements 
these loans are collateralized by star s inventory 
as of december   the total amount outstanding under this loan agreement was million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the disposition of comtel  a former wholly owned subsidiary in the electronics segment  the company guaranteed million of a million line of credit extended by a loan association to biometric technologies corp 
btc  the buyer of comtel 
the stockholders of btc have personally guaranteed to the company payment for any amounts borrowed under this line of credit in excess of approximately million in the event the company is obligated to honor this guaranty 
the amount btc has outstanding under the line of credit at december  was approximately million 
regardless of whether the sale of star to coherent is consummated  the company s strategic plan is to continue to fund research and development for its medical and cosmetic laser products 
the company expects to expand the scope and extend the term of its current clinical trial agreement with mgh following the sale of star 
this research and development effort entails extensive clinical trials 
these activities are an important part of the company s business plan 
due to the nature of clinical trials and research and development activities  it is not possible to predict with any certainty the timetable for completion of these research activities or the total amount of funding required to commercialize products developed as a result of such research and development 
the rate of research and the number of research projects underway are dependent to some extent upon external funding 
while the company is regularly reviewing potential funding sources in relation to these ongoing and proposed research projects  there can be no assurance that the current levels of funding or additional funding will be available  or  if available  on terms satisfactory to the company 
the company will consider a number of alternatives with respect to its future products  including manufacturing them itself and selling them directly and or through distributors or selling the product line and or technology to others 
the company will in each case choose the alternative which it believes best maximizes profitability and long term shareholder value 
the company has historically incurred significant losses 
while the company achieved profitable operations for the three and six months ended december   primarily related to the operations of star  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
therefore  the company may need to continue to secure additional financing to complete its research and development activities  commercialize its current and proposed medical products and services  and fund ongoing operations 
there can be no assurance that the sale of star to coherent will be completed resulting in cash proceeds to the company of million and that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional financing 
the sale must be approved by the company s stockholders  and is also subject to regulatory approval and other standard closing conditions 
financing of the company s future operating plan is now to a great extent dependant on completing the sale 
if the sale of star is not completed the company will require additional financing during and there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
based on its historical ability to raise funds as necessary and ongoing discussions with potential financing sources  the company believes that it will be successful in obtaining additional financing  if required  in order to fund future operations 
the report of the company s independent public accountants in connection with the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity deficit and cash flows for the three years ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the company s recurring losses  working capital deficiency and stockholders deficit raises substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
d year issues during  the company has been actively engaged in addressing year yk issues  which result from the use of two digit  rather than four digit  year dates in software  a practice which could cause date sensitive systems to malfunction or fail because they may not recognize or process date information correctly 
state of readiness to manage its yk program  the company has divided its efforts into four program areas o information technology computer hardware and software o physical plant manufacturing equipment and facilities o products including product development o extended enterprise suppliers and customers for each of these program areas  the company is using a four step approach o ownership creating awareness  assigning tasks o inventory listing items to be assessed for yk readiness o assessment prioritizing the inventoried items  assessing their yk readiness  planning corrective actions  developing initial contingency plans o corrective action deployment implementing corrective actions  verifying implementation  finalizing and executing contingency plans at december   the ownership  inventory and assessment steps were essentially complete for all program areas 
the company expects to complete corrective action deployment by june costs to address yk issues the company s estimated aggregate costs for its yk activities from through are expected to be less than  through december  the company has spent approximately  risks of yk issues and contingency plans the company continues to assess the year issues relating to its physical plant  products and suppliers 
the company intends to develop a contingency planning process to mitigate worst case business disruptions such as delays in product delivery  which could potentially result from events such as supply chain disruptions 
the company expects its contingency plans to be complete by june e nasdaq stock market listing the company has been notified by the nasdaq stock market nasdaq that for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market the company must meet nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement of per share 
because the company s stock price fell below for a day trading period between august and october   it is now subject to delisting 
the company met with representatives of nasdaq on march  and presented arguments supporting continued listing 
at the hearing  the company volunteered to delist from the nasdaq smallcap market on may  if it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by that date 
the company expects that it will be in compliance by that date  as a result of the reverse split and the star sale 
nasdaq s decision is still pending 
to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  the company has asked its stockholders to approve a reverse split of the company s common stock 
however  the reverse split may not enable the company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in time to prevent delisting 
the company s management anticipates that the absence of the nasdaq listing for the company s common stock would have an adverse effect on the market for  and potentially the market price of  the company s common stock 
the delisting of the common stock would likely reduce stockholders ability to buy and sell company common stock  and the company s ability to raise capital 
if the company s common stock is delisted from nasdaq  the company expects that brokers would continue to make a market in the company s common stock on the otc bulletin board 
f recently issued accounting standard in february  financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

ii primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact it currently sells its products in united states dollars 
the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
statement under the private securities litigation reform act in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k the following cautionary statements should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts including  without limitation  statements concerning the sale of star  financing of future operations  and the company s research partnership with mgh and other information provided by the company and its employees from time to time may contain certain forward looking information  as defined by i the private securities litigation reform act of the reform act and ii releases by the sec 
the risk factors identified below  among other factors  could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested in such forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the cautionary statements below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the reform act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of safe harbor provisions of the reform act 
risk factors if we do not close the sale of our star subsidiary  we may not have enough money to finance future operations 
we have recently signed an agreement with coherent in which coherent has agreed to buy our star subsidiary for million in cash 
the sale must be approved by stockholders holding a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock 
the sale is also subject to other standard closing conditions 
we may not receive a sufficient number of stockholder votes to approve the transaction  or the transaction may fail to close for other reasons 
our future operating plan is now to a great extent dependant on completing the sale  in that it will provide us with the money necessary to finance our future operations  including research and product development 
we may be delisted from nasdaq 
delisting may reduce your ability to buy and sell our common stock and our ability to raise money 
we have been notified by the nasdaq stock market that for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market we must meet nasdaq s minimum bid price of per share 
because our stock price fell below for a day trading period between august and october   it is now subject to delisting 
nasdaq held a hearing on our delisting on march  nasdaq s decision is pending 
to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  we have asked our stockholders to approve a one for seven reverse split of our common stock 
at the march  hearing  the company volunteered to delist from the nasdaq smallcap market on may  if it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by that date 
we expect that we will be in compliance by that date as a result of the reverse split and the star sale 
nevertheless  the reverse split may not enable us to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in time to prevent delisting 
the delisting of our common stock would likely reduce stockholders ability to buy and sell our common stock and our ability to raise capital 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  it will likely be quoted on the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc or nasdaq s otc bulletin board 
these listings can make trading more difficult for stockholders 
in addition  a reverse split itself could hurt the market price of our common stock 
we may need to secure additional financing  and our auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have a history of losses 
as a result  the report of our independent public accountants in connection with our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity deficit and cash flows for the three years ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses  working capital deficiency and stockholders deficit raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we do not sell our star subsidiary  we may have to secure additional financing to complete our research and development activities  commercialize our current and proposed cosmetic laser products  and fund ongoing operations 
we may also determine  depending upon the opportunities available  to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund the costs of acquisitions or expansion 
if we finance an acquisition with our stock  our issuance of such stock could result in dilution to the interests of our stockholders 
additionally  if we incur indebtedness to fund increased levels of accounts receivable  finance the acquisition of capital equipment  or if we issue debt securities in connection with any acquisition we will be subject to risks associated with incurring substantial additional indebtedness 
one of those risks is that interest rates may fluctuate and our cash flow may be insufficient to pay principal and interest on any such indebtedness 
we will continue to be dependent on coherent if we do not sell star 
under our sales agency agreement with coherent  which will remain in effect until november  if we do not sell star to coherent  coherent receives a marketing and sales commission  based on the end user price  for each of our lasers that it sells 
if coherent remains as our exclusive distributor because we do not close the star sale  coherent may not be successful in distributing our lasers or may not give sufficient priority to marketing our products 
in addition  coherent may develop  market and manufacture its own lasers that incorporate our proprietary technology and compete with our lasers  in which case it must pay us a royalty on such sales 
under our agreement  if we are unable or unwilling to manufacture the cosmetic laser products to be distributed by coherent  then we must license to coherent the technology necessary to make such products 
our future revenue depends on our developing new products 
we face rapidly changing technology and continuing improvements in cosmetic laser technology 
in order to be successful  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new products that meet changing market demands  enhance existing products  and achieve market acceptance for such products 
we have in the past experienced delays in developing new products and enhancing existing products 
if we sell our star subsidiary  our future revenue will be entirely dependent on sales of newly introduced products 
although we have recently introduced a new hair removal laser  it may not achieve market acceptance or generate sufficient margins 
in addition  the market for this type of hair removal laser may already be saturated 
at present  broad market acceptance of laser hair removal is critical to our success 
we need to diversify our product line by developing cosmetic laser products other than hair removal lasers 
we face intense competition from companies with superior financial  marketing and other resources 
the laser hair removal industry is highly competitive  and companies frequently introduce new products 
we compete in the development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of hair removal lasers with numerous other companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  some of our competitors are able to sell hair removal lasers at prices significantly below the prices at which we sell our hair removal lasers 
in addition  if and when we sell star  our current distributor  coherent  one of the largest and best financed laser companies  will become our competitor  and we will have to find new ways to distribute our products 
our laser products also face competition from alternative medical products and procedures  such as electrolysis and waxing  among others 
we may not be able to differentiate our products from the products of our competitors  and customers may not consider our products to be superior to competing products or medical procedures  especially if competitive products and procedures are offered at lower prices 
our competitors may develop products or new technologies that make our products obsolete or less competitive 
our quarterly operating results may decrease if we sell star  and that may hurt the price of our common stock 
almost all of our revenues in our most recent two quarters were attributable to sales of the lightsheer tm diode laser manufactured by star 
if we sell star  our revenues will decline significantly 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall dramatically 
our lasers are subject to numerous fda regulations 
compliance is expensive and time consuming 
our products may not be able to obtain the necessary fda clearances before we can sell them 
all of our products are laser medical devices 
laser medical devices are subject to fda regulations regulating clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  we must obtain clearance from the fda 
compliance with the fda clearance process is expensive and time consuming  and we may not be able to obtain such clearances timely or at all 
we are dependent on third party researchers 
we are substantially dependent upon third party researchers  over whom we do not have absolute control  to satisfactorily conduct and complete research on our behalf and to grant us favorable licensing terms for products which they may develop 
at present  our principal research partner is the wellman labs at massachusetts general hospital 
we provide research funding  laser technology and optics know how in return for licensing agreements with respect to specific medical applications and patents 
our success will be highly dependent upon the results of the research 
we cannot be sure that such research agreements will provide us with marketable products in the future or that any of the products developed under these agreements will be profitable for us 
our common stock could be further diluted as the result of our issuing convertible securities  warrants and options 
in the past  we have issued convertible securities  such as debentures and preferred stock  and warrants in order to raise money 
we have also issued options and warrants as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees and directors 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities 
our issuing additional convertible securities  options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders  and could reduce the market price of our common stock 
our proprietary technology has only limited protections 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to protect adequately our proprietary intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and customers and restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information  to detect unauthorized use and to take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot prevent someone else from asserting a claim against us in the future for violating their intellectual property rights 
in addition  costly and time consuming lawsuits may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed exclusively to us  to protect our trade secrets and or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of others intellectual property rights 
the laser industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
because patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the united states until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the united states  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications 
any claims for patent infringement could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays  require us to develop noninfringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the laser industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could have a negative impact on gross margins 
there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our charter documents and delaware law may discourage potential takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws  and delaware law could be used by our incumbent management to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control might be beneficial to our stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in particular  we may issue preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval  upon terms determined by our board of directors 
the rights of our common stockholders may be adversely affected by the rights of holders of any preferred stock issued in the future 
our issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding stock 
as with any new products  there is substantial risk that the marketplace may not accept or be receptive to the potential benefits of our products 
market acceptance of our current and proposed products will depend  in large part  upon our or any marketing partners to demonstrate to the marketplace the advantages of our products over other types of products 
there can be no assurance that the marketplace will accept applications or uses for our current and proposed products or that any of our current or proposed products will be able to compete effectively 
we face risks associated with pending litigation 
we are involved in disputes with third parties 
such disputes have resulted in litigation with such parties 
we have incurred  and likely will continue to incur  legal expenses in connection with such matters 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will result in favorable outcomes for us 
an adverse result in the mehl patent litigation  the action relating to the swiss franc debentures  or the varljen litigation all described in detail in item could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are unable to determine the total expense or possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of these proceedings 
these matters may result in diversion of management time and effort from the operations of the business 
we may not be able to retain our key executives and research and development personnel 
as a small company with less than employees assuming the sale of star our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and research and development positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
we face a risk of financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury 
our products are and will continue to be designed with numerous safety features  but it is possible that patients could be adversely affected by use of one of our products 
further  in the event that any of our products prove to be defective  we may be required to recall and redesign such products 
although we have not experienced any material losses due to product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that we will not experience such losses in the future 
we maintain general liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate and maintain umbrella coverage in the aggregate amount of  however  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
in the event we are found liable for damages in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage  or if any claim or product recall results in significant adverse publicity against us  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  although our products have been and will continue to be designed to operate in a safe manner  and although we attempt to educate medical personnel with respect to the proper use of our products  misuse of our products by medical personnel over whom we cannot exert control may result in the filing of product liability claims or significant adverse publicity against us 
computer systems on which we rely may not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
we are at this time utilizing internal resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test our systems for year compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which our systems rely will also be converted in a timely manner or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on our systems 
management is in the process of assessing the year compliance costs  however  based on information to date excluding the possible impact of vendor systems  management does not believe that it will have a material effect on our earnings
