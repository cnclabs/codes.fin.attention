the company reports only those bookings for which it receives a fee 
excluding passive airline bookings  growth in active bookings for the year was in the united states 
the increase in international booking volumes for the year was driven by strong growth in europe  the middle east  southeast asia and africa

year the year issue is a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the computer programs or systems of the company or the company s vendors and suppliers that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than beginning in september  the company implemented a program designed to help ensure that all hardware and software used in connection with the company s business  including the company s software products  will manage and manipulate data involving the transition of dates from to without functional or data abnormality and without producing inaccurate results related to such dates 
an internal analysis of the company s hardware and software has led the company to conclude that the majority of the company s systems have been engineered to be year compliant and should provide a seamless transition to the year in addition  the company has consulted outside experts  including attorneys and independent auditors  regarding its year plans 
the company electronically exchanges information with the computer systems of the company s vendors and suppliers  including air  car  hotel and tour vendors 
the company uses standardized travel industry interchange formats to electronically exchange information with many of such vendors and suppliers 
many of these formats did not require modification in order to be year compliant 
where required  modifications to these formats have been completed 
the company s globalfares system began successfully processing airline fares with year dates in july in addition  the investigation and assessment of the company s network systems is complete and remediation for such systems is in progress and on track for completion during the third quarter of the company has completed remediation planning for the company s travel agency based software and began distribution of year upgrades for operating systems and package installation systems used in connection with the company s travel agency based software during the third quarter of the year remediation of the company s travel agency based software addresses aesthetic modifications only and is not essential for the reservation booking and ticketing capability of these products 
the company will continue to work with its ndcs to distribute and install  where necessary  upgrades to pc hardware and software either on a normal maintenance cycle where it exists  or a separate implementation plan where it does not exist 
remediation activities related to the company s mainframe computer systems  which include the company s apollo and galileo crss  were completed on schedule in the company s apollo and galileo systems successfully processed the first year airline reservation bookings on january  and february   respectively  with airlines which support year in their systems 
non mainframe activities are on track for completion before the third quarter of embedded systems are not an integral component in the company s primary business or operations 
nevertheless  the company has identified and validated as compliant or  where necessary  is in the process see statement regarding forward looking statements on page of remediating embedded systems in certain of the company s facilities and environmental systems 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse impact to its business or operations related to year performance of embedded systems 
as an electronic global distribution system  the company s products are dependent upon data provided by its air  car  hotel and tour vendor customers and other suppliers of data 
the company is also dependent on critical service providers  such as telecommunications firms for worldwide product distribution 
the company is continuing to assess year issues arising from its relationships with third parties  including its ndcs  to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to failure by such parties to remediate their own year sensitive systems 
the company has requested year compliance status information from all of its vendor customers  critical other suppliers of data and its ndcs 
the company continues to work closely with its ndcs to provide assistance to meet their year challenges 
while many of these third parties have reported that they are not finding significant problems in their own systems  there can be no guarantee that the systems of these third parties will be made year compliant in a timely manner 
vendor customers  service providers and ndcs continue to participate with the company in year testing 
the company completed contingency plans for its mainframe systems on schedule in and anticipates that the contingency plans for non mainframe systems will be complete prior to the third quarter of the company will continue to review and revise contingency plans to address possible year failures of its internal systems and business processes or those of vendor customers  critical service suppliers  other suppliers of data and its ndcs  on whose systems the company is dependent 
the company s contingency plans identify the interruption of local services provided by third parties  such as telecommunication firms and power supply companies  as the events which would be most likely to occur 
however  should a problem occur  it would generally be localized and the company does not anticipate that it would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s contingency planning involved risk assessment for all of the company s business functions and operating and staff departments  including the identification of assumptions and dependencies 
the contingency plans for each business function and operating and staff department provide for proactive preparation for year challenges  checklists of activities to perform for validation of possible failures and reactive planning to address any actual year failures 
the contingency plans also address on site staff coverage on january  for all operating and staff departments  and include support personnel from the company s critical hardware and software suppliers 
the interruption of services provided by critical service providers  such as telecommunications firms and power supply companies  due to their own year difficulties  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
with respect to bookings for travel after january   any failure on the part of the company  its vendor customers  other suppliers of data or ndcs to ensure that their systems are year compliant  regardless of when such bookings occur  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
testing is a critical component in the company s year preparedness program 
the company s system for year hardware and software validation called the time machine is essentially a copy of the company s production environment which performs date sensitive tests and supports connectivity to the systems of its vendor customers  suppliers of data  ndcs and certain other third parties without interrupting existing systems and without risk of contaminating live production data 
the company incurred million of expenses in and million of expenses in related to year remediation 
the company expects future expenditures to total approximately million 
all of such costs are expected to be expensed as incurred 
further  the company expects to incur additional costs after to remediate and replace less critical software applications and embedded systems  however  such expenses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the cost of the company s year project and the dates on which the company plans to complete its year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  third parties year readiness and other factors 
based on the company s current schedule for completion of its year project  the company believes that its planning is adequate to secure year readiness of its critical systems 
nevertheless  achieving year readiness is subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are described above 
the company is not able to predict all of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from its current expectations about its year readiness 
at this time  the company believes the major risks associated with year processing are a system failure or miscalculation causing an inability to process bookings or engage in other normal business activities 
if the company  or third parties with whom the company has significant business relationships  fail to achieve year readiness with respect to critical systems  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new european currency in january  certain european countries introduced a new currency unit called the euro 
the company planned  developed and successfully implemented a project to ensure that hardware and software systems operated or licensed in the company s business  including systems provided to its travel agency subscribers and its vendor customers  are designed to properly process reservations in the euro currency 
the company completed the necessary development and successfully issued tickets in the new single currency on the first official trading day  january  the company estimates that the introduction of the euro  including the total costs for the euro project  will not have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain of the company s expenses are subject to fluctuations in currency values and interest rates 
the company addresses these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
to some degree  the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments  but management does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings
