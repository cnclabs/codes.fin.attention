item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covers the company s years ended december  and as well as periods prior to when the company operated as the ordnance and aerospace divisions of olin  but has been prepared as if the company were a separate entity for all periods discussed 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain data  expressed as a percentage of sales  from the company s consolidated statements of operations for the three years ending december   and sales large caliber ammunition medium caliber ammunition ball powder r propellant electronic products space products other products and services cost of goods sold gross profit selling and administration expense research and development expense other charges operating income interest expense other income  net non recurring income income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss year ended december  compared to the company s sales of million during increased by million  or compared to the sales increase includes higher ordnance and tactical systems division sales which were million in compared to million in this increase reflects higher sales of large caliber ammunition  steel pipe joints and the inclusion of million of sales associated with the cms group which was acquired in november of ordnance and tactical systems sales increases were offset by declines in the sales of medium caliber ammunition which benefited in from a catch up in production resulting from delays in aerospace and electronics division sales increased to million in as compared to million in aerospace and electronics division electronic products sales reflect a increase in the sales of empower tm airline passenger seat power supply systems and solid systems sales reflect a increase resulting from munitions dispensing devices used on two missile systems 
these increases more than offset the decline in sales associated with the high power pulsed energy device product line that was sold in april and the decline in space systems sales 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in margins on large caliber ammunition increased during due to improved operations 
margins on electronic products increased during due to improved performance and a more favorable product mix 
margins also improved in due to the absence of cost overruns  which were experienced in on ammunition demilitarization and high power pulsed energy contracts 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to from in the increase reflects the combination of higher bid and proposal costs  which increased over the level  and higher management incentive expense associated with improvements in the company s operating performance 
research and development costs increased from due to new product initiatives in the space and electronics businesses 
non operating income and expense for include a pre tax gain of million recognized on the sale of the company s high power pulsed energy device product line and a pre tax charge of million associated with a settlement regarding costs for environmental remediation at a former manufacturing site 
during  the company was awarded  net of expenses  million in a binding arbitration concerning a breach of contract 
the award was based on the defendant s ceasing and failing to complete payments on the production of certain components used in automobile airbags 
million of the award represents payments due under the contract and was included in operating income 
the balance of million represents future payments which have been recognized as non recurring income 
interest expense during decreased from this reduction reflects lower average outstanding debt balances during as compared to the average debt outstanding during was million with an average effective interest rate of compared to average debt outstanding during of million with an average effective interest rate of 
income tax expense of million and million was recorded in and  respectively  on pre tax income of million in and million in the company s and effective tax rate of and  respectively  differ from statutory rates due principally to expenses associated with goodwill which are not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes and from the favorable federal tax treatment given to certain export sales 
year ended december  compared to the company s sales of million in increased by million  or compared to the sales increase is primarily due to higher shipments of medium caliber ammunition  artillery propelling charges  ball powder r propellant  steel pipe joints  and space and electronics products 
these increases offset lower sales of international tank ammunition  solid propellant products  and electromagnetic systems 
increases in medium caliber ammunition sales reflect the correction of production problems that delayed shipments in the increases in artillery propelling charge sales reflect activity on a contract received in early  for which there was no comparable activity in ball powder r propellant sales increased over the depressed levels  principally due to improved commercial sales 
space products sales increases reflect higher shipments associated with the commercial satellite market 
electronics sales increases resulted from the introduction of the company s empower tm airline passenger seat power supply 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the gross margin percentage on medium caliber ammunition increased by approximately and reflects the improved delivery and cost performance for those products 
margin improvements also benefited from a product mix which included sales of artillery propelling charges and higher space  electronics  and ball powder r propellant sales 
these higher margin sales offset unfavorable performance that resulted in cost overruns during on ammunition de militarization and high powered pulsed energy contracts 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the increase reflects the combination of higher bid and proposal costs  which increased over the level  additional costs associated with the company s start up and status as a new independent public company and management incentive expense associated with improvements in the company s operating performance 
interest expense decreased from the level 
this reduction reflects the application of the company s cash flow to debt reduction and lower interest rates on outstanding debt 
the financial statements reflected million of debt outstanding for the entire year with an average effective interest rate of 
the average debt outstanding during was million with an average effective interest rate of 
income tax expense of million and million was recorded in and  respectively  on pre tax income of million in and a pre tax loss of million in the company s effective tax rate of is higher than statutory rates due principally to goodwill amortization  which is non deductible 
us government sales us government sales amounted to million in  million in and million in see item business us government contracts and regulations 
approximately  and  respectively  of total  and us government sales were to the united states department of defense dod or agencies thereof 
changes in the strategic direction of defense spending  the timing of defense procurements and specific defense program appropriation decisions may adversely affect the performance of the company in future years  including its income  liquidity  capital resources  and financial condition 
the precise impact of these decisions will depend upon their timing and the size of changes and the company s ability to mitigate their impact with new business  business consolidations or cost reductions 
in view of the continuing uncertainty regarding the size  content and priorities of the annual dod budget  the historical financial information of the company may not be indicative of future performance and the viability of certain facilities and equipment may also be impacted 
dod sales activities are historically stronger in the latter part of the year because the timing of the recognition of the dod ammunition sales tends to reflect the procurement cycle utilized by the us army 
since the us government usually awards and funds ordnance contracts on a year by year basis and the company s business is dependent upon periodic awards of new contracts and the exercise of options contained in existing contracts  there can be no assurance that the us government will continue to purchase the company s products and services over the long term 
the termination of any of the company s significant contracts or the failure to obtain either renewals of certain existing contracts or additional contracts with the us government would have a material adverse effect on its results of future operations and financial condition 
environmental the company is a party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with waste disposal  manufacturing and test sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former manufacturing and test facilities and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
historically  the company has funded its environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expects to do so in the future 
the company s consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million and million at december  and  respectively  which are classified as other non current liabilities 
those amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
those liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects and normal plant operations are expected to range between million and million annually over the next several years 
while the company does not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of its environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and the company s ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the time periods sometimes lengthy over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably against the company 
service costs from the time of the distribution to december   the company obtained certain services from olin  such as payroll and benefits administration  mainframe computing services  and telecommunications support 
olin was reimbursed by the company at rates comparable to the pre distribution inter company charges 
the cost of these services for was approximately million 
during  the company obtained these services on its own  at costs which approximate the rates charged by olin 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
the statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company expects to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of the distribution  the company assumed all obligations for a revolving credit agreement rca entered into december   by olin  under the terms of which participating banks have committed a maximum of million to the company for cash borrowings and letters of credit 
the rca expires on december  the company pays interest under the rca on outstanding borrowings at the company s choice of various floating rate options and is required to pay a facility fee ranging from to of the borrowing commitment 
to facilitate short term borrowing flexibility  certain rca participating banks have agreed to provide the company uncommitted and unsecured short term lines of credit at interest rates similar to those under the rca 
aggregate borrowings under the rca and short term lines are limited to the committed maximum of million 
outstanding borrowings under the rca at december  were million with a weighted average note interest rate of 
outstanding borrowings under short term lines of credit at december  were million with a weighted average note interest rate of 
interest paid in and was million and million  respectively 
in december  the company issued senior notes the term notes in the amount of million 
interest on the term notes is payable semiannually 
scheduled principal repayments on the term notes are million annually commencing in with the remaining principal balance due in december the rca and term notes both contain a number of financial covenants including requirements to maintain ratios of i minimum earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense  and ii maximum total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and contain certain minimum tangible net worth requirements 
the rca also contains limitations on amounts available to pay dividends or repurchase company stock restricted payments 
at december   the amount available for restricted payments was million 
under the terms of these financial covenants the company had up to an additional million available for borrowings at december  during december  the company entered into hedging transactions  in the form of interest rate swap agreements  to protect against increases in market interest rates on long term borrowings under the rca 
the notional principal subject to interest rate swap agreements at december  was million on which the company was receiving a weighted average variable interest rate of and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 
the resulting reduction in interest expense for was not significant 
for the year ended december   net cash used by operations totaled million compared to cash provided by operations in of during  the company experienced working capital reductions associated with receipt of contract advances and the correction of delivery delays experienced in these contract advances require the achievement of certain performance milestones which accelerate contract payments in exchange for reduced selling prices 
during  the favorable impact of these contract advances were reduced due to a reduction in the value of contracts providing for accelerated payments and an increase in the value of contracts with less favorable payment terms 
this change in the mix of contract payment terms resulted in a usage of cash of approximately million during during the fourth quarter  the company also experienced working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventories due to delays in the shipment of medium caliber ammunition and the start up of an artillery propelling charge contract 
the combined impact of changing levels of contract advances and working capital investment caused operating cash flow in to be greater than  and in to be less than  the cash flows that ordinarily would have been realized 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment in increased from due to higher planned spending 
in  the company received million from the sale of assets related to its high powered pulsed energy device product line 
in november  the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of cms  inc and defense research incorporated the cms group for million  including million of transaction costs 
in august  the board of directors of the company authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
during  the company purchased and retired  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
cash dividends paid during and totaled approximately million 
the net cash usage from operating activities  after capital spending  stock repurchases  dividends  acquisitions and divestitures totaled million in which was funded by increases in debt 
during  the company generated net cash from operating activities of million after capital spending  stock repurchases and dividends  which was used to reduce debt 
subject to the risk factors identified in the forward looking statements section set forth below and based upon the availability under the rca and the company s projected cash flow from operations  management believes that the company s capital resources are adequate to meet its foreseeable business needs 
effect of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in the united states  inflation did not have a material adverse effect on the sales or operating results of the company during the three most recent fiscal years 
impact of year the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date are a known risk 
the company s processes for evaluating and managing the risks and costs associated with this potential problem are being managed by a team of internal staff and outside consultants 
the company s financial and operational systems are being identified and assessed for year compliance  and efforts to modify existing software or convert to new compliant software are underway 
the company believes the identification and assessment phase of this process is substantially complete 
the company employs a number of information technology systems in its operations  including  without limitation  computer networking systems  financial systems and other similar systems 
a number of these systems have been recently implemented by the company and these recently implemented systems are believed to be year compliant 
the company s assessment has indicated that some of the company s financial systems could be affected by the year problems and accordingly  the company has begun a process of either modifying or converting these systems to make them year compliant 
the company believes that the modification or conversion of these financial systems will be substantially completed by mid the company also employs electronic equipment containing software and embedded chips in its production and manufacturing systems 
the company s assessment has indicated that this electronic equipment is not likely to be susceptible to a material system failure resulting from year problems 
selective equipment upgrades are currently being implemented where warranted and the company believes that it can complete necessary modifications and conversions without a material impact on the company 
the company has completed an assessment of year issues associated with major products that the company has sold and believes that the company has no material exposure related to year problems for products it has sold 
the company has initiated communications with significant vendors  customers and other third party service providers to evaluate whether they are making adequate efforts to achieve year compliance 
to date  the company is not aware of any third parties with a year issue that would materially impact the company 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that third parties will be year ready  and the effect of non compliance by third parties is not determinable by the company 
the company has material relationships with the us government 
year non compliance by the us government  such as the inability to process payments to the company  could have a material impact on the company 
the company will continue to evaluate the status of its year compliance to determine whether a contingency plan is necessary  but no such contingency plan has yet been adopted by the company 
the company has not yet determined what the nature and timing of any such contingency plan would be 
the total cost of the company s internal year project is presently estimated to be less than million  which includes the purchase of new software and equipment which will be capitalized 
the cost of the company becoming year compliant and the timing in which the company believes it will complete the necessary year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the success of the company in identifying systems and programs having year issues  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace the affected programs  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  and the extent to which the company might be adversely impacted by vendors  customers and other third party service provider s failure to remediate their own year issues

item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and risk management policies the company manages its exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain firm sales commitments and anticipated  but not yet committed sales  by entering into foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts  respectively 
the company also is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from its long term revolving credit agreement  and uses interest rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
the company s risk management objective in entering into such contracts and agreements is only to reduce its exposure to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements and interest rate fluctuations and not for speculative investment 
at december  the fair market values of market risk sensitive instruments or potential for near term losses of earnings or cash flows for such instruments was not material
