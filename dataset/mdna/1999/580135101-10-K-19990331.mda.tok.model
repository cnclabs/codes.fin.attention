increasing market share through expansion  and customer satisfaction through quality  service  cleanliness and value continue as key strategic initiatives to build sales 
sales increases in and were primarily due to restaurant expansion and positive comparable sales measured on a constant currency basis  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies 
at the end of  of systemwide sales were in the following markets australia  brazil  canada  england  france  germany  hong kong  japan  the netherlands  taiwan and the us major markets based on operating income 
this is down slightly from in sales increases in the us  europe and latin america were driven by expansion and positive comparable sales in and in the us  successful monopoly  teenie beanie babies  get back with big mac and disney promotions  combined with local market initiatives  contributed to the increase 
in europe  performances benefited from value campaigns and successful promotions in england  france and germany 
europe s results were reduced by the difficult economic conditions in russia in the last half of in latin america  argentina and brazil accounted for approximately half of this segment s total sales growth in both years  mainly due to expansion 
in asia pacific  sales decreased in due to weaker foreign currencies and negative comparable sales 
excluding the translation effect of weaker foreign currencies  japan realized strong sales growth despite experiencing its most difficult economy in decades 
in addition  australia s sales improved due to positive comparable sales in the last half of the year 
difficult economic conditions in southeast asia  which began in the latter part of and continued throughout  negatively impacted consumer spending 
in  sales increased primarily due to expansion 
in millions us      europe      asia pacific      latin america     other      systemwide sales      sales by company operated restaurants grew at a higher rate than systemwide sales in and  primarily due to the higher unit growth rate of company operated restaurants outside the us relative to systemwide restaurants 
in addition  the weakened japanese yen had a significant negative effect on our japanese affiliate s sales  which reduced systemwide sales growth 
average annual sales per restaurant in thousands us traditional    satellite outside the us traditional    satellite restaurants in operation at least consecutive months average sales are affected by several factors comparable sales and the size and number of new restaurants 
the number of new restaurants affects average sales as new restaurants historically have taken a few years to reach long term volumes 
in addition  over the last several years we have opened more restaurants in lower density areas and countries with lower average sales volumes 
for these reasons  our focus is primarily on sales to investment ratios and building comparable sales  rather than on average sales 
in  positive comparable sales drove the increases in us average annual sales per restaurant 
outside the us  foreign currency translation accounted for approximately half of the decreases in average annual sales in both and in addition  the significant number of new restaurants outside the us negatively impacted the averages 
average annual sales per new restaurant in thousands us traditional    outside the us traditional    satellite restaurants in operation at least months but not more than months in and  the increases in sales per new us traditional restaurant were due to a more selective expansion strategy 
in addition  in  larger facilities supported higher average sales 
the decreases in sales per new restaurant outside the us in and were due to foreign currency translation and expansion 
excluding foreign currency translation  the average annual sales for new international traditional and satellite restaurants increased to  and  respectively 
satellite restaurants generally have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes than traditional restaurants 
average annual sales per new traditional restaurant in major markets outside the us  excluding japan  were approximately million in and total revenues total revenues include sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates 
these fees include rent  service fees and royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees 
fees vary by type of site and investment by the company  and also according to local business conditions 
these fees  along with occupancy and operating rights  are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have year terms 
revenues grow as new restaurants are added and as sales build in existing restaurants 
menu price changes also affect revenues and sales  but it is impractical to quantify their impact because of different pricing structures  new products  promotions and product mix variations among restaurants and markets 
revenues increased at a faster rate than systemwide sales in and this was primarily due to the weakened japanese yen  which negatively affected sales more than revenues due to our affiliate structure in japan  and the higher unit growth rate of company operated restaurants outside the us relative to systemwide restaurants 
us revenues increased million in and million in the increased revenue growth in was primarily due to strong sales performance for both company operated and franchised restaurants driven by positive comparable sales and expansion 
lower initial fees resulting from fewer openings partly offset the increase in revenues 
the slower revenue growth in was primarily because the number of us company operated restaurants decreased compared with the prior year  while the number of franchised and affiliated restaurants increased 
lower initial fees also contributed to the slower revenue growth in us operating results excluding made for you costs and special charges in millions revenues sales by company operated restaurants      revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants      total revenues      operating costs and expenses company operated restaurants      franchised restaurants selling  general and administrative expenses other operating income expense total operating costs and expenses      us operating income      the results exclude million of made for you costs and the million special charge for a pre tax total of million 
the results exclude the million pre tax special charge 
europe accounted for of consolidated revenues in and in this region s revenues grew million and million in and  respectively 
the increases were driven by strong sales in england  france and germany in and in england  italy and russia in asia pacific s revenues grew million in  compared with growth of million in in constant currencies  these increases were million in and million in due to an increase in ownership  several affiliate markets were consolidated for financial reporting purposes in this contributed to the revenue increase 
the consolidation of singapore in  along with taiwan s strong results  helped to advance revenues 
difficult economic conditions in southeast asia  which began in the latter part of and continued throughout  dampened revenue growth in both years 
operating results outside the us in millions revenues sales by company operated restaurants      revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants     total revenues      operating costs and expenses company operated restaurants      franchised restaurants selling  general and administrative expenses other operating income expense total operating costs and expenses      operating income outside the us      latin america s revenues grew million in and million in growth in both years was primarily due to expansion in brazil and positive comparable sales for the segment 
company operated margins company operated margin dollars are equal to sales by company operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants 
consolidated company operated margin dollars increased million or in and million or in the increases were primarily driven by expansion  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies 
in addition  positive comparable sales contributed to the increase in consolidated company operated margins were of sales in  in and in operating cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows food paper costs decreased in and increased in  payroll costs were flat in and decreased in  and occupancy other operating costs increased in both years 
us company operated margins were of sales in and in and increased margins as a percent of sales in were driven by lower food paper costs related primarily to decreased commodity costs  partly offset by higher payroll costs related to an increase in average hourly rates 
occupancy other operating costs were flat 
us company operated margins as a percent of sales in reflected higher food paper costs related primarily to the deluxe line  lower payroll costs related to labor efficiencies and lower occupancy other operating costs 
company operated margins outside the us were of sales in  compared with in and in in  increases in occupancy other operating costs as a percent of sales were the primary cause of the margin decline as payroll costs and food paper costs were flat as a percent of sales 
the decline in the margin as a percent of sales was due to increases in food paper costs as well as occupancy other operating costs  partly offset by a decrease in payroll costs 
weaker foreign currencies put pressure on margins outside the us in both and  as food paper costs were negatively affected in those markets where we imported products 
franchised margins franchised margin dollars are equal to revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company s occupancy costs rent and depreciation associated with these sites 
franchised margin dollars represented more than of the combined operating margins in both and consolidated franchised margin dollars increased million or in and million or in the increases were primarily driven by expansion  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies 
in addition  positive comparable sales contributed to the increase in consolidated franchised margins were of applicable revenues in  in and in franchised margins in the us were of revenues in  in and in outside the us  franchised margins were of revenues in  in and in the and declines reflected a higher proportion of leased sites  and in the us also reflected lower initial fees resulting from fewer openings 
by leasing a higher proportion of new sites over the past few years  we have reduced initial capital requirements  but negatively affected franchised margins as a percent of applicable revenues 
this is because financing costs implicit in the lease are included in rent expense  which affects these margins  for owned sites  financing costs are reflected in interest expense  which does not affect these margins 
also  our decision to increase our ownership in several affiliate markets in and shifted revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants to company operated restaurants  reducing the franchised restaurant margins outside the us selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in and decreased to of sales from of sales in and in  us selling  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower advertising costs and savings realized from the home office productivity initiative  partly offset by higher performance based incentive compensation 
outside the us  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  due to support of restaurant development and to a lesser extent  from the consolidation of several affiliate markets for financial reporting purposes  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies 
in  consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to continued investment in developing countries and the support of special marketing efforts and new food initiatives in the us  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies 
as a result of the home office productivity initiative  the company expects to save about million of selling  general and administrative expenses per year  beginning in  with about two thirds of the annual savings expected to be realized by the end of about million of these savings were realized in made for you costs in  the company announced the introduction of made for you  a new food preparation system that is expected to be installed in virtually all restaurants in the us and canada by the end of through advances in equipment and technology  the new system allows us to serve fresher  better tasting food at the speed of mcdonald s 
the system also supports future growth through product development because it can more easily accommodate an expanded menu 
the company is providing financial incentives of up to  per restaurant to owner operators to defray the cost of equipment made obsolete as a result of converting to the new system 
the company is also making additional payments in special cases where the conversion to made for you is more extensive 
in  the company incurred million in made for you costs  which primarily consisted of nonrefundable incentive payments made to owner operators as well as accelerated depreciation on equipment being replaced in company operated restaurants 
the company expects the total costs related to the implementation of made for you to approximate million 
the remaining costs are expected to be incurred by the end of  and are comprised of about million of incentive payments and million of accelerated depreciation 
special charges in second quarter  the company recorded a million pre tax special charge related to the results of the company s home office productivity initiative 
this initiative is designed to improve staff alignment  focus and productivity and reduce ongoing selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  the company is reducing home office staffing by approximately positions  consolidating certain home office facilities and reducing other expenditures in a variety of areas 
the special charge was comprised of million of employee severance and outplacement costs  million of lease cancellation and other facilities related costs  million of costs for the write off of capitalized technology made obsolete as a result of the productivity initiative  and million of other cash payments made in employee severance is paid in semi monthly installments over a period of up to one year after termination 
as of december   the company had reduced home office staffing by approximately positions and expects the remaining positions to be eliminated by year end the remaining accrual  primarily related to employee severance  was approximately million at december  no significant adjustments have been made to the original plan approved by management in second quarter the company expects to use cash provided by operations to fund the remaining severance payments and other cash costs related to the productivity initiative 
in  the company recorded a million pre tax special charge related primarily to plans to strengthen the us business and reduce ongoing costs by closing low volume us satellite restaurants  outsourcing excess property management and implementing other cost efficiencies 
the actions required by this plan were completed in and resulted in no significant adjustments to the original cost estimate 
other operating income expense other operating income expense includes gains on sales of restaurant businesses  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net gains or losses from property dispositions and other transactions related to the food service business 
gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of company operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements arrangements where the company leases the businesses  including equipment  to owner operators who have options to purchase the businesses 
the company s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market 
these transactions are an integral part of our franchising business and resulting gains are recorded in operating income 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates businesses the company actively participates in  but does not control is reported after interest expense and income taxes  except for us restaurant partnerships  which are reported before income taxes 
net gains or losses from property dispositions result from disposals of properties due to restaurant closings  relocations and other transactions 
other operating income expense decreased in  primarily due to higher provisions for property dispositions that reflected an increased number of restaurant closings 
these expenses were partly offset by higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses and increased equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  due to strong performances in japan and the us the slight decline in other operating income expense in was primarily due to lower equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses  partly offset by lower provisions for property dispositions 
operating income excluding made for you costs and the special charges  operating income increased million or to billion in  and million or to billion in in constant currencies  these increases were in and in the increases in and were primarily due to higher combined operating margin dollars  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies and lower other operating income expense 
in addition  higher selling  general and administrative expenses negatively affected the increase 
including made for you costs and the special charges  operating income decreased in and increased in operating income in and from the major markets accounted for of total operating income  excluding made for you costs and the special charge 
us operating income rose million or in and was flat in  excluding made for you costs and special charges 
in  higher us combined operating margin dollars and lower selling  general and administrative expenses were offset in part by lower other operating income expense 
in  higher us franchised margin dollars were offset by lower company operated margin dollars and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
including made for you costs and special charges  us operating income decreased million or in and increased million or in outside the us  operating income rose million or in and million or in in constant currencies  these increases were in and in this growth was driven by higher combined operating margin dollars resulting from expansion in both years and slightly positive comparable sales in in both years  weaker foreign currencies and higher selling  general and administrative expenses partly offset these increases 
in  the australian dollar  brazilian real  canadian dollar  japanese yen and russian ruble  as well as the southeast asian currencies  were the primary currencies negatively affecting results 
europe accounted for and of consolidated operating income in and  respectively 
europe s operating income grew million in compared with million in weaker currencies offset this region s operating income increase in by only or million  and by or million in strong operating results in england  france  germany  italy and spain drove the increase in operating income in the region s results were negatively affected by the difficult economic conditions in russia  which are expected to continue in england  france and germany accounted for of europe s operating income in both and asia pacific s operating income declined million in compared with an increase of million in the decline in was primarily due to weaker foreign currencies 
on a constant currency basis  asia pacific s operating income would have increased million in and million in in  japan and hong kong had strong operating results despite the difficult economic conditions that were experienced by much of the region beginning in the latter part of and continuing throughout in addition  this segment benefited in both years from the financial reporting consolidation of several affiliate markets 
australia  hong kong  japan and taiwan contributed about of asia pacific s operating income in both years 
latin america s operating income increased million in and million in argentina  brazil and venezuela led this region s increase in continued expansion and positive comparable sales drove improved results across this segment in and brazil accounted for about of latin america s operating income in both years 
the recent economic turmoil in brazil is expected to negatively impact operating results in the latin america segment represented of consolidated operating income in interest expense higher average debt levels  partly offset by weaker foreign currencies and lower average interest rates  accounted for the and increases in interest expense 
nonoperating income expense nonoperating income expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income and gains and losses related to other investments  financings and translation 
results in reflected translation losses compared with translation gains in  while in interest income and translation gains were lower than in provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was for  compared with for and for a million tax benefit resulting from certain international transactions was primarily responsible for the unusually low tax rate in the company expects its effective income tax rate to be in the range of to 
consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets  net of valuation allowance  of million in and million in substantially all of the tax assets arose in the us and other profitable markets  and a majority of them are expected to be realized in future us income tax returns 
restaurants mcdonald s continues to focus on managing capital outlays more effectively through prudent and strategic expansion 
in  the company added  restaurants systemwide  compared with  in and  in in  the company expects to add about  restaurants  with a continued emphasis on traditional restaurants primarily in locations outside the us us      europe      asia pacific      latin america   other     systemwide restaurants      the us net additions declined in and  primarily due to the closing of low volume satellite locations and a more stringent restaurant selection process 
asia pacific s percent of total restaurants has grown primarily due to japan s significant expansion 
japan added restaurants in  in and in  representing of systemwide restaurant additions in and about in and approximately of japan s restaurant additions in and  and about in  were satellites 
therefore  these additions affected unit growth more than sales growth 
at the end of  of systemwide restaurants were in the major markets  compared with in in  of restaurant additions were in these major markets  and we anticipate a similar percent for longer term  markets like china  italy and mexico are expected to represent a growing proportion of restaurant additions 
more than of company operated restaurants and more than of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets in franchisees and affiliates operated of restaurants at year end that percentage has remained relatively constant over the past three years 
financial position and capital resources total assets and capital expenditures total assets grew billion or in and million or in in and  about of consolidated assets were located in our major markets excluding our affiliate in japan 
net property and equipment rose billion in and represented of total assets at year end 
capital expenditures decreased million or in and decreased million or in  reflecting fewer restaurant additions  the new building program in the us in that gave owner operators the option to own new restaurant facilities  and more leased sites  combined with weaker foreign currencies 
us capital expenditures declined million or in and declined million or in  primarily due to a more selective expansion strategy and the new building program 
about of the qualifying new traditional restaurant buildings opened in are owned by owner operators 
in addition  the company leased the land for over of the new traditional restaurants opened in the us in these programs saved the company approximately million in capital outlays in capital expenditures outside the us decreased million or  due to fewer restaurant additions and weaker foreign currencies in capital expenditures outside the us increased slightly in in  of capital expenditures was invested in markets outside the us  compared with in and in approximately was invested in our major markets excluding japan in  compared with in and in in millions new restaurants      existing restaurants other properties capital expenditures      total assets      expenditures for existing restaurants were made to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction  including technology to improve service and food quality  and to enhance older facilities 
other properties primarily included expenditures for office buildings and related computer equipment and furnishings 
the company s expenditures for new restaurants in the us were minimal as a result of the programs previously discussed 
however  we continue to focus on the system s average development costs land  building and equipment to ensure an appropriate return on investment for the system 
average development costs for the us system were million in and million in the increase was primarily due to the construction of larger facilities to support higher average sales volumes 
average development costs for traditional restaurants in our major markets outside the us  excluding japan  were approximately million in both and average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market 
these costs are managed through the use of right sized restaurants  construction and design efficiencies  standardization and global sourcing 
average development costs for satellite restaurants located in brazil  canada and japan  which comprise over of all satellites outside the us  were approximately  in both years 
the utilization of these small  often limited menu restaurants has allowed expansion into areas that would otherwise not have been feasible 
including affiliates  total land ownership was and of total restaurant sites at year end and  respectively 
capital expenditures by affiliates  which were not included in consolidated amounts  were approximately million in  compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to increased ownership in the philippines  south korea and thailand  which converted them from affiliates to majority owned subsidiaries in  and to a lesser extent  weaker foreign currencies 
cash provided by operations the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial borrowing capacity to meet its operating and discretionary spending requirements 
free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures grew to million in  compared with million in cash provided by operations was reduced by approximately million of made for you incentive payments made in and million of us franchisee security deposit refunds in cash provided by operations  along with other sources of cash such as borrowings  was used for capital expenditures  share repurchase  dividends and debt repayments 
the company generated positive free cash flow in for the eighth consecutive year 
this trend is expected to continue 
in  operations outside the us generated positive free cash flow for the first time in our history  and this is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
dollars in millions cash provided by operations      free cash flow cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures cash provided by operations as a percent of average total debt in addition to its free cash flow  the company can meet short term needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements 
accordingly  the company strategically maintains a relatively low current ratio 
at year end financings and market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
mcdonald s strives to minimize these risks by financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated and employing established policies and procedures to manage this exposure 
see summary of significant accounting policies on page for additional information regarding our use of financial instruments and the impact of the new accounting standard on derivatives 
the company uses major capital markets and various techniques to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
for example  currency exchange agreements in conjunction with borrowings help obtain desired currencies at attractive rates and maturities 
interest rate exchange agreements effectively convert fixed rate to floating rate debt  or vice versa 
the company also manages the level of fixed rate debt to take advantage of changes in interest rates 
the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge intercompany financings and long term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on net income and shareholders equity 
total foreign denominated debt  including the effects of currency exchange agreements  was billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
as a percent fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt weighted average annual interest rate of total debt foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt total debt as a percent of total capitalization total debt and total shareholders equity moody s and standard poor s have rated mcdonald s debt aa and aa  respectively  since duff phelps began rating the debt in and currently rates it aa 
these strong ratings are important to the company because of global development plans 
the company has not experienced  nor does it expect to experience  difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
at year end  the company and its subsidiaries had billion available under committed line of credit agreements  billion under a euro medium term note program and 
billion under shelf registrations for future debt issuance 
the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring  redeeming and repurchasing debt  terminating exchange agreements  and using derivatives 
gains of approximately million  related to the early termination of interest rate exchange agreements in  were deferred and are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over various periods through the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes 
all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
the company actively hedges selected currencies to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on reported results and to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty and other payments received in the us in addition  where practical  mcdonald s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges  and the company typically finances in local currencies  creating economic hedges 
the company s exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies 
at year end and  assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed in us dollars 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities were as follows in millions of us dollars december  canadian dollars deutsche marks british pounds sterling australian dollars brazilian reais french francs austrian schillings japanese yen the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments  however  the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the us based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from year end levels nor a adverse change in foreign currency rates from year end levels would materially affect the company s results of operations  cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments 
total shareholders equity total shareholders equity rose million or in  and represented of total assets at year end 
weaker foreign currencies decreased shareholders equity by million in the company uses free cash flow and debt capacity to repurchase shares because we believe this enhances shareholder value 
over the past years  the company has invested billion to buy back million shares at an average price of approximately  while maintaining a strong equity base 
at year end  the company held million shares in treasury with a market value of billion 
in september  the company announced plans to repurchase billion of its common stock by year end during the third quarter  the company completed its billion  three year share repurchase program begun in in  the company repurchased a total of million shares for nearly billion  million of which related to the new billion program 
the company uses common equity put options in connection with its share repurchase program 
in  the company sold million common equity put options  of which million options were outstanding at december  these options expired unexercised in february given the company s returns on equity and assets  management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of earnings back into the business and use free cash flow for share repurchase 
accordingly  the common stock dividend yield is modest 
however  the company has paid consecutive quarterly dividends on common stock through first quarter and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year 
additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders  profitability expectations and financing needs 
returns operating income is used to compute return on average assets  while net income less preferred stock dividends net of tax is used to calculate return on average common equity 
month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 
as a percent return on average assets return on average common equity computed excluding made for you costs and special charges 
including made for you costs and special charges  return on average assets was in and in  return on average common equity was in the increases in the returns are due to strong operating results  enhanced by the company s continued focus on more efficient capital deployment 
this included the closing of a number of low volume satellite restaurants  a more stringent site selection process  the new building program in the us and the use of free cash flow for share repurchase 
other matters effects of changing prices inflation the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
this is because of rapid inventory turnover  the ability to adjust prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made cheaper by inflation 
in hyperinflationary markets  menu board prices are typically adjusted to keep pace with inflation  mitigating the effect on reported results 
year the company has assessed its computerized systems to determine their ability to correctly identify the year and is devoting the necessary internal and external resources to replace  upgrade or modify all significant systems which do not correctly identify the year substantially all necessary modifications and testing of the company s significant systems have been completed 
the last necessary replacement of a significant system is expected to be completed in third quarter in addition  the company has determined the extent to which its operations may be affected by the compliance efforts of its significant suppliers and is taking the necessary steps to minimize potential problems 
the company has implemented a systemwide supply chain compliance monitoring program  which encompasses supplier risk assessment and compliance validation for significant suppliers 
management does not expect year issues relating to internal systems and suppliers to pose significant operational or financial difficulties for the company  however  in the unlikely event mcdonald s or a significant number of its key suppliers are unable to resolve an issue in a timely manner  such matters could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition  failures related to year issues by providers of infrastructure services could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
contingency plans are being developed  to the extent feasible  to address unexpected year issues that might arise either internally  within the supply chain or by infrastructure service providers 
these plans are expected to be completed well before the end of modification and testing costs are expensed as incurred  while the costs of new systems are capitalized 
the company expects its total costs related to modification and testing as well as costs associated with supply chain risk assessment and contingency planning to be less than million  of which approximately million was incurred through december  in addition  the company expects to capitalize approximately million of costs for ongoing development of significant new systems that are replacing non year compliant systems 
about million of these costs were capitalized at decem ber  the total year costs have not and are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
all year statements contained herein are designated as year readiness disclosures pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act of euro conversion on january   member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is now trading on currency exchanges and may be used in certain transactions such as electronic payments 
beginning in january  new euro denominated notes and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions between the member countries  which for the company  primarily consist of payments to suppliers 
in addition  as the company uses foreign denominated debt and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and to minimize its foreign currency risks  certain of these financial instruments will be redenominated into euros 
the company has restaurants located in all member countries and has been preparing for the introduction of the euro for the past several years 
the company is currently addressing the issues involved with the new currency  which include converting information technology systems  recalculating currency risk  recalibrating derivatives and other financial instruments and revising processes for preparing accounting and taxation records 
based on the work to date  the company does not believe the euro conversion will have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
