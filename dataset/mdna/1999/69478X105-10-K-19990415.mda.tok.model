rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

through such management  management of the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management of the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the company s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
between the time the company originates loans and purchase commitments are issued  the company is exposed to both upward and downward movements in interest rates which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
the board of directors of the company recently implemented a hedge management policy primarily for the purpose of hedging the risks associated with loans held for sale in the company s mortgage pipeline 
in a flat or rising interest rate environment  this policy enables management to utilize mandatory forward commitments to sell fixed rate assets as the primary hedging vehicles to shorten the maturity of such assets 
in a declining interest rate environment  the policy enables management to utilize put options 
the hedge management policy also permits management to extend the maturity of its liabilities through the use of short financial futures positions  purchase of put options  interest rate caps or collars  and entering into long interest rate swap agreements 
since this policy was implemented after march   the company has engaged in only a limited amount of hedging activities 
management is continuing to evaluate and refine its hedging policies 
no hedging positions were outstanding at december  net portfolio value 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline the sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by estimating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk policy of the bank provides that the maximum permissible change in npv for a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates is a change in the net portfolio value 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purpose of the risk based capital requirement 
see item business regulation federal savings institution regulation 
as of december   the most recent date for which the relevant data is available  the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million reduction in the npv of the bank 
as of december   the bank s sensitivity measure is basis points above the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
the ots has postponed indefinitely the date the component will first be deducted from an institution s total capital 
see item business federal savings institution regulation 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the bank s core products do not behave in a manner which the ots model projects 
borrowers of portfolio series loans are less likely to refinance or prepay such loans because of the high cost of obtaining a high loan to value loan 
in addition  management believes that borrowers of liberator series loans are less likely to refinance or prepay such loans because of their lack of an adequate credit rating or possible prior credit problems 
accordingly  although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
the results of this modeling are monitored by management and presented to the board of directors  quarterly

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
however  the bank has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain deriative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the company does not currently enter into hedging transactions  therefore  the adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in october  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise  which is effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage backed activities  to require that after securitization of the mortgage loans held for sale  an entity engaged in mortgage banking activities classify the resulting mortgage backed securities or retained interest based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
management has not yet completed its analysis of the effect this standard will have on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
