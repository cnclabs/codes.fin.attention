additionally  in  the company discontinued sale of three product lines  axcess  webserver  and secure webserver  that it had previously offered in fiscal years and management believes that this impacted annual revenue growth by in versus product revenues the company s product revenues decreased over the prior year 
product revenues include software products  which include the licensing of transact  the company s flagship product for internet commerce  livecommerce  the folio product suite  and shopsite products  and royalty revenues  which include publisher royalties and merchant license fees 
in  the decrease in product revenue was principally due to two factors a decrease in software product revenues from the company s folio products group and in  the company recorded approximately  in product revenues for the sale of its axcess product line to raptor  inc  a one time event as well as approximately  in other discontinued products 
the decrease in folio software revenues was due to a decrease in demand for the company s cd rom based publishing software  which is sold to corporate customers primarily through the company s business partners 
management believes that the decrease in demand for cd rom based publishing software over the year was due to the industry s gradual migration to internet based publishing software 
product revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
management expects that product revenues will continue to comprise the greater percentage of total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in  the company s product revenues grew over revenues 
the company increased the unit sales of its flagship product  transact  while also acquiring folio and driving the folio product sales to higher levels 
additionally  product revenue growth in was partly attributed to the one time licensing of the company s axcess technology to raptor  inc  and increases in publisher royalties and merchant license revenues from the prior year 
service revenues in fiscal  the company s total service revenues grew over the prior year due to increased demand for its professional service offerings and its maintenance and support services 
professional services include education  implementation and consulting services 
professional service revenues increased primarily due to an increase in consulting projects related to the development of payment gateways  fraud modules  and custom engineering  as well as other special projects related to the company s internet commerce solutions 
in  the company continued to build its infrastructure as well as improve the marketing and delivery of these services 
accordingly  in fiscal  professional service revenues increased over fiscal years and increased from to and accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company s service revenues grew by over the prior year due to a developing professional service practice as well as an increased customer base that generated significant maintenance and support revenue 
the demand for consulting services in fiscal fueled the significant growth in professional service revenues 
these consulting services included the development of various gateways and modules related to the company s internet commerce solutions 
maintenance and support revenues are derived from the execution and delivery of the company s software product maintenance and technical support program 
a product maintenance and support agreement secures the customer s right to receive product updates  upgrades and enhancements from the company  on a when and if available basis  for all products specifically covered under the agreement 
the customer also receives technical support in the form of telephone or on site assistance from the company  as appropriately required  to continually ensure the smooth operation of the covered products in the customer s environment 
customers are typically required to renew their contracts on an annual basis as the standard maintenance and support agreement is months in duration 
thus  maintenance and support revenues are typically a function of new product sales and the annual renewal of existing contracts in the program 
maintenance and support is calculated at to of the list price of the product purchased depending on the type of program chosen and less any applicable discounts 
in fiscal years  and  the company experienced positive trending of its maintenance and support revenues in conjunction with its expanding customer base and strong renewal rates 
in fiscal  maintenance and support revenues increased over fiscal years and increased from to and accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
management believes that despite these positive historical trends  a significant or prolonged downturn in product revenues and or increased cancellations of the maintenance and support program by existing customers could have a negative impact on future maintenance and support revenue trends

in fiscal years and  the increased cost of product revenues was primarily due to increased costs for the company s third party royalty commitments 
management believes that these costs as a percentage of product revenues will remain in the range of to for the foreseeable future as the company incorporates more third party technology into its products and continues to resell third party software products with its internet commerce solutions

the company continued to increase the number of its consultants by hiring and using external sources throughout the year in order to meet the needs of its customers 
additionally  service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues decreased approximately from the prior year  primarily due to continued investments in resources required to grow the consulting business and lower consultant utilization rates resulting from extended training processes for new employees

in fiscal  service gross margin as a percentage of service revenues increased approximately from fiscal as a result of improved consultant utilization rates 
additionally  the company increased the number of consultants throughout the year in order to meet the needs of its customers 
operating expenses operating expenses for the three year period were as follows years ended december  selling and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    acquired in process research and development   restructuring charges  total operating expenses    selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the cost of sales and marketing personnel and outside consultants  as well as the costs associated with marketing programs  industry tradeshows  sales seminars  advertising  and product literature 
in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses decreased approximately from the prior year 
the decrease was attributed primarily to a decrease in salary and travel expenses as a result of reductions in sales and marketing headcount throughout the year and lower commission expenses as a result of lower product revenues 
the company s domestic sales strategy consists primarily of a direct sales force for internet commerce products and a combination of a direct sales force and channel partners for its suite of folio publishing products 
the company s international sales strategy consists of both a direct sales force and channel partners to market and distribute all of its products 
the substantial increase in these expenses in from was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel from the acquisition of folio 
other costs included in selling and marketing are the preparation and distribution of new product sales literature and an increase in facilities from foreign sales offices that opened during in fiscal  selling and marketing expenses also increased due to commission expenses on significantly larger revenues 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the cost of research and development personnel and independent contractors  certain purchased technology  as well as equipment and facilities costs related to such activities 
in fiscal  these expenses decreased approximately over the prior year primarily as a result of a reduction in employee related expenses 
the company completed a number of technical projects during the year that resulted in significant planned reductions in engineering headcount and expenses related to outside technical consultants whose services were no longer required upon completion of these various projects 
in addition  the company realized headcount reductions and other efficiencies from consolidation of the research and development activities from the waypoint  folio and icentral acquisitions 
accordingly  management does not believe that the fiscal reductions will hinder the company s position as a technology leader within the internet commerce industry 
the company has invested approximately  into research and development over the last three fiscal years and management believes that the current level of investment will remain consistent in the coming periods 
qualifying capitalizable software development costs were immaterial in all periods and accordingly  the company has charged all such expenses to research and development in the period incurred 
the substantial increase in these expenses in from was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of research and development personnel from the acquisitions of folio and waypoint 
the company continued the hiring of additional software engineers and consultants to develop and enhance the company s products during  in addition to those added through the acquisition 
internationalization costs for the company s various products also contributed to the increased research and development costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the cost of finance  management and administrative personnel  and legal and other professional fees 
these expenses increased slightly in fiscal from the prior year due to strong overall management of expenses and increased efficiencies resulting from headcount reductions 
the marginal increase was due to an increase in the amortization of goodwill 
the substantial increase in these expenses in from was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of general and administrative personnel from the acquisition of folio 
other items that contributed to increased costs were amortization of goodwill as a result of the acquisition of folio and increased legal fees  as well as the expansion of the company s operations 
acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development expenses consisted of  relating to the icentral acquisition in fiscal  and  and  relating to the acquisitions of waypoint and folio  respectively  in fiscal these costs were expensed as of the acquisition dates and are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the respective periods 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development relates to projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and that  until completion of development  have no alternative future use 
as of the acquisition date of icentral in april  icentral had initiated a research and development effort related to the third major revision of its flagship shopsite product suite  an internet commerce product suite that allows small to medium sized web merchants to transact business on the internet 
the elements of the product suite are as follows shopsite express  a tool that allows web designers to add a shopping system to any existing web site  shopsite manager  which offers the shopping functionality of shopsite express combined with an automated commerce site management system  and shopsite pro  which combines the features of shopsite manager with an additional set of advanced commerce tools including real time payment processing 
the in process technology included significant new modifications of the features and functionality of the current suite of products  such as the addition of cybercash as a payment option  quantity discount interface capability to allow customers to purchase at quantity discounts  tax modifications to allow the merchant to decide whether to calculate tax before or after shipping is calculated  improved shipping configuration of united parcel service shipping zones  and a mailing list generator 
it is expected that these modifications will further enhance the product s ease of use in the marketplace 
as of the acquisition date  the in process project was approximately complete and it was estimated that the in process technology would have a year life and that the first product s would be introduced during the first quarter of fiscal the value of the acquired in process technology was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income stream of the estimated future product sales of the developed technology 
this was determined by estimating the costs of developing the purchased in process development project into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the project adjusting the cash flow for percentage of completion and the core technology component of the acquired technology and discounting adjusted the net cash flows to their present value 
the estimates used to value the future revenue benefits of the in process research and development were based on elements of relevant market sizes and growth risk factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
in the valuation analysis  aggregate revenues for icentral products were estimated to be approximately  for fiscal and increasing to approximately  in revenues for the in process technology were estimated to be approximately  for fiscal and increasing to approximately  in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
the estimated revenues for the in process technologies were expected to peak within four years of the acquisition date 
the estimated overall life of the acquired developed technologies of icentral is five years 
operating expenses used in the valuation of icentral included selling  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
operating expenses were estimated based on historical expense levels of similar companies operating in similar industries 
selling  general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue for the in process technologies were estimated to be throughout the estimation period 
research and development expenses  also expressed as a percentage of estimated revenue  were estimated to be approximately and in and  respectively  and stabilizing at for the remainder of the estimation period 
cost of sales was estimated based on an analysis of historical information for similar companies operating in similar industries 
cost of sales for both the developed and in process technologies was estimated to be throughout the estimation period 
the discount rate selected for both the developed and in process technologies was and was estimated by calculating a weighted average cost of capital wacc based on publicly traded guideline companies 
the wacc represents the blended  after tax costs of debt and equity 
the cost of equity was estimated using the capital asset pricing model capm and by reviewing venture capital rates of return 
the fair values of the assets acquired from icentral were allocated between the following asset fair market value in process research and development  developed technology  goodwill type assets  acquired assets total  the valuation analysis was performed in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinions nos 
and  wherein all identifiable assets and intangible assets acquired were identified and analyzed to determine their fair market values 
in addition  to identify the in process research and development and determining if there were any alternative future uses for these projects  these projects were evaluated in the context of interpretation of financial accounting standards board statement no 
fas and fas accounting for software costs 
such evaluation consisted of a specific review of the efforts and uniqueness of the developments of these projects  and a determination of whether technological feasibility had been achieved 
accordingly  the company believed that the foregoing assumptions used in the icentral acquired in process research and development analysis were reasonable at the time of acquisition 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected sales revenues  development costs  or profitability  or the events associated with such projects will transpire  or have transpired  as estimated 
the company believes that the shopsite product suite requires continual upgrading and refinement to remain competitive in the targeted markets 
thus  the failure to complete the in process projects as scheduled may cause shopsite revenue to fall off precipitously from forecasted levels 
the company estimates that if the scheduled shopsite product releases were not achieved  the existing shopsite product suite would remain commercially viable for only the next to months 
in fiscal  the in process research and development for the waypoint and folio acquisitions was expensed as a charge against operations in the first quarter of the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development from the waypoint and folio acquisitions relates to projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that  until completion of development  have no alternative future use 
these projects will require substantial development and testing prior to reaching technological feasibility 
however  there can be no assurance that these projects will reach technological feasibility or develop into products that may be sold profitably by the company 
the technology acquired has required  and will continue to require  substantial additional development by the company 
restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a restructuring plan to better align its operating costs with its anticipated future revenue stream 
the major component of the restructuring relates to the elimination of approximately employees across the following functions engineering  marketing  general and administrative and services 
in addition  employees moved from engineering to consulting 
other components related to the exiting of certain contractual arrangements for porting and product integration that resulted from a change in product strategy 
other charges included the write off of unutilized software  originally intended for use by the sales force but not implemented due to the reduction in marketing personnel 
at december  approximately  of accrued restructuring charges remained  which is comprised of approximately of severance related costs and of contractual costs 
the total cash impact of the restructuring amounted to approximately  the total cash paid as of december  was approximately and the remaining amount will be paid in following are the significant components of the restructuring charge employee severance  benefits and related costs  write off of assets termination costs of certain contractual arrangements non operating income non operating income for the three year period were as follows years ended december  interest income    interest expense  other expense income total non operating income   interest income represents interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
the decreases in interest income in fiscal years and  as compared to the prior year  were attributed primarily to lower average investments in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as a result of funding of operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense relates to the interest charged on the line of credit  the company s note payable issued in conjunction with the folio acquisition  a non recourse factoring agreement  the mortgage for the company s provo  utah facility  as well as an obligation under a license agreement 
the increase in interest expense relates to the additional financing arrangements the company entered into throughout fiscal and other income expense primarily represents foreign currency translation gains and losses 
in fiscal  the company also recorded a loss of approximately on an equity investment 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the three year period were as follows years ended december  provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for foreign income taxes in fiscal years   and this provision relates to the amount of estimated taxes due in foreign jurisdictions for the company s foreign operations and certain withholding tax 
the company has had losses for us tax purposes for all periods to date and  accordingly  there has been no provision for us income taxes 
management believes that the provision for income taxes will fluctuate in the future and is dependent upon the geographical location of future sales and the associated withholding taxes in certain countries 
the provision for income taxes will also fluctuate when the company becomes eligible for corporate income taxation in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  an increase of  from december the company s operating activities utilized cash and cash equivalents of approximately   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
accounts receivable increased approximately in fiscal from the prior year primarily as a result of the quarterly cyclical nature of the sales process as well as the granting of extended payment terms to certain new and long standing creditworthy customers 
the company s investing activities used cash and cash equivalents of approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the principal uses of cash for investing activities were  paid for purchases related to certain property  plant  and equipment and  paid in cash for purchases of certain marketable securities 
the company s financing activities provided cash and cash equivalents of approximately   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company received proceeds of  from intel and  from cmg and cvi for the private sale of equity securities 
in addition  the company received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options under the company s stock incentive plan and stock purchases under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  the company repaid  of the note payable issued to reed elsevier in in connection with the folio acquisition with a cash payment of  the balance of  was settled by the issuance of the company s common stock 
in july  the company entered into a  mortgage of its provo  utah  building which bears interest at the fixed rate of 
the mortgage principal payments are based upon a year term with a balloon payment of  due on june  the company has an unsecured credit facility arrangement with a bank  which provides up to  in financing in the form of a demand line of credit 
borrowings under this line are limited to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and of eligible foreign accounts receivable  as defined  and bear interest at the prime lending rate at december  
the company is required to comply with certain restrictive covenants under this agreement and the line is collateralized by the company s accounts receivable 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  during  the company increased its borrowings under this facility to  and  remained available as of december  the company has a non recourse factoring agreement under which it can factor up to  of qualified accounts receivable  as defined 
the company sold approximately  of accounts receivable during the second quarter of there was  of accounts receivable outstanding under the factoring agreement at december  the company sold no accounts receivable during the third and fourth quarters of at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately  these losses are available to reduce federal and state taxable income  if any  in future years 
these losses are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period that are in excess of 
while the company believes that it has experienced a change in ownership in excess of  it does not believe that this change in ownership will significantly impact the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards 
the company believes that its existing capital resources are adequate to meet its cash requirements for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s plans or other events affecting the company s operations will not result in accelerated or unexpected expenditures 
restatement of june  and september  financial statements in march  the company restated its june  and september  financial statements to reflect a change for the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of icentral and the related amortization of intangibles 
this adjustment decreased the amount previously allocated to in process technology by  which has been capitalized as developed technology and goodwill and will be amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
the restatement was the result of concerns presented by the securities and exchange commission sec regarding the valuation methodology used for the determination of charges for acquired in process research and development costs 
the company believes that its periodic reports filed june  and september   which included such charges related to the acquisition costs for icentral  were made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and established industry practices at the time 
in addition  the valuation of the acquired in process research and development was supported by an independent valuation by arthur andersen llp 
the company has not been contacted by the sec regarding its valuation methodology 
however  in response to the sec s new guidelines  the company has decided to proactively move to the new valuation methodology for its acquisition of icentral 
therefore  the company expensed  to in process research and development in the second quarter of  capitalized  of developed technology and goodwill  and amortized the developed technology and goodwill over the year estimated useful life 
year compliance background the company recognizes that it must ensure that its products and operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures  which can arise in date sensitive software applications that utilize a field of two digits to define the applicable year 
in such applications  a date using as the year may be recognized as the year rather than the year state of readiness with respect to the company s internal systems  of the company s mission critical information technology systems are considered to be year compliant  as defined by the criteria established by the british standards institute 
with respect to the company s software products  the company has developed and implemented a detailed year test procedure for the phase review and software release process to ensure that its software products are year compliant 
the execution of this test procedure began in october and management expects that such testing will continue throughout and well into additionally  approximately of the company s embedded product vendors are already considered to be year compliant  based wholly on external and internal testing of such embedded products 
as a result  management expects that the company and its key vendors will be positioned to successfully meet all year compliance issues for the company s products 
related costs management has assessed the related costs for year compliance to be in the range of to to date  the company has incurred costs of approximately for its year projects 
such costs may include those for research and development  capital equipment  outside software tools  outside contractors  and other internal resources that may be assigned to the project 
management acknowledges that these costs may be subject to reassessment as testing of the company s products and mission critical systems is completed and compliance is fully achieved 
perceived risks at the present time  management does not expect year issues to have a material adverse impact on the company s business or future results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be interruptions of operations or other limitations of system or product functionality  or that the company will not incur significant costs to avoid such interruptions or limitations 
for example  such interruptions or limitations may include disruptions in customer service and technical support facilities  interruptions to customer access to on line products and services  information or other communications  delays in manufacturing and shipping of products  and other interruptions or delays in the day to day operations of the company 
in addition  even if the company s products are year compliant  other systems or software used by the company s domestic and international customers may not be year compliant 
the failure of any such non compliant third party software or systems contained in such operating environments may negatively affect the performance of the company s products  which may lead to increased costs associated with correcting technical problems  lost sales  or other negative consequences resulting from customer dissatisfaction  including litigation 
such failure may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
contingency plans in order to avoid such material adverse effects  the company will continue to seek business relationships only with those entities that are actively and successfully addressing year issues 
if the inability of certain existing vendors or customers to successfully address year issues begins to present adverse business effects for the company  management may elect to suspend such business relationships until such time that such vendors or customers become fully compliant 
euro currency on january  certain member countries of the european union eu established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the eu s common currency  the euro 
the former currencies of the participating countries are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until january  when the euro will be adopted as the sole legal currency 
the company is currently assessing the impact that the conversion to the euro will have on its european operations 
the company is evaluating the potential impact in several areas of its business including the ability of its information systems to handle euro denominated transactions and the impact on exchange costs and currency exchange rate risks 
the company is also evaluating the impact that cross border price transparencies  which may affect the ability to price products differently in various countries  will have on its margin 
although the company is still in the assessment phase  the conversion to the euro is not expected to have a material impact on the company s operations or financial position 
certain factors that may affect future results introduction this annual report contains certain forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause the company s operating results to differ materially or adversely are discussed below 
rapid technological change the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
as a result  there is uncertainty about the widespread acceptance of new products that can cause significant delays in the sales cycle 
the company must continue to upgrade its own technologies and commercialize products and services incorporating such technologies that may also lengthen the sales cycle 
the introduction of product or service enhancements or new products or services embodying new technologies  industry standards  or customer requirements could supplant or make obsolete the company s existing products and services 
developing internet market the market for the company s internet products and services has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced and developed products and services for internet commerce 
the company s future operating results depend upon the development and growth of the market for internet based packaged software applications  including electronic commerce applications 
the acceptance of electronic commerce in general and  in particular  the internet as a sales marketing and order receipt and processing medium are highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  cost  ease of use  quality and service and the effect of government regulation remain unresolved and may impact the growth of the internet 
if the market fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
recent acquisition in april  the company completed the strategic acquisition of icentral 
the company faces challenges relating to integration of operations such as coordinating geographically separate organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
there can be no assurance that the acquired business or its products will be successful  that the company will successfully integrate the acquired business into the company  or that the company will achieve the desired synergies from the transaction 
product release schedules delays in the planned release of the company s new products may adversely affect forecasted revenues  and create operational inefficiencies resulting from staffing levels designed to support the forecasted revenues 
the company s failure to introduce new products  services  or product enhancements on a timely basis may delay or hinder market acceptance and allow competitors to gain greater market share than the company 
government regulation and legal uncertainties the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to  or commerce on  the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy  taxation  the content of products  and the nature of services 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or inhibit companies ability to conduct electronic commerce  which could in turn adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
moreover  the applicability of the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
further  due to the encryption technology contained in the company s products  such products are subject to us export controls 
there can be no assurance that such export controls  either in their current form or as may be subsequently enacted  will not delay the introduction of new products or limit the company s ability to distribute products outside of the united states 
while the company intends to take precautions against unlawful exportation  the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to effectively control the distribution of the company s products 
in addition  federal or state legislation or regulation may further limit levels of encryption or authentication technology 
further  various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology and have adopted laws relating to personal privacy issues that could limit the company s ability to distribute products in those countries 
any such export or import restrictions  new legislation or regulation or government enforcement of existing regulations could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
complex products  lengthy sales cycles the company s products are complex and often involve significant investment decisions by prospective customers 
accordingly  the license of the company s software products can be expected to require the company to engage in a lengthy sales cycle and to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the company s products 
as a result  the company s sales cycles may be subject to a number of significant delays over which it has little or no control 
delays in such transactions due to lengthy sales cycles or delays in customer production or deployment of a system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition and could be expected to cause the company s operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
security a significant barrier to market acceptance of online commerce and communication is the concern regarding the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information over public networks 
the company relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure exchange of valuable and confidential information 
there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments such as breakins and similar disruptive problems caused by internet users will not result in a compromise or breach of algorithms used by the company in its products to protect customer transaction data 
if any such compromise or breach was to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and operating results 
competition the market for internet commerce software is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
the internet is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products and services for commerce on the internet 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  and marketing resources and greater name recognition than does the company 
the company s operating results will be affected by the number of competitors and their pricing strategies and market acceptance of their products 
dependence on personnel the company s future success depends in significant part upon the continued service of its key technical and senior management personnel  and its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
the company s ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership in the industry depends in large part upon the skills of its development personnel 
pricing future prices that the company is able to charge for its products may decline from historical levels due to competitive reasons and other factors 
in the future  the company may have to reduce the prices of its products substantially or introduce lower priced lines of products to gain greater market share 
limited operating history the company has a limited operating history 
the company s ability to successfully market its existing products and to develop and market new products must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s expense levels are fixed in advance and based in part on its expectations as to future revenues
