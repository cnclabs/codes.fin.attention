industry background minimally invasive surgical procedures medical practitioners have  for many years  sought means to improve the care of their patients and minimize the trauma and recovery time associated with such care 
in recent years  as life expectancy has increased  overall health care costs have outpaced the average inflation rate 
the performance of surgical procedures utilizing minimally invasive techniques has been a response to both the need to continuously improve the quality of patient care and the increasing pressures to control the total cost of providing that care 
minimally invasive surgical procedures typically involve a few small incisions rather than the large incisions used in traditional open surgery  thereby reducing patient trauma 
mis procedures involve three basic capabilities a means to gain access to the treatment site  a means to assess the treatment site  and a means to provide therapy 
although less invasive alternatives to traditional open surgery have existed for a number of years  the trend toward minimally invasive techniques was not widespread until the late s 
at that time  surgeons developed and perfected a technique for gall bladder removal through the use of specialized access  diagnostic and treatment devices 
by  an estimated of the approximately  gall bladder procedures in the united states were performed using minimally invasive techniques 
a number of surgical procedures  other than gall bladder surgery  are undergoing conversion to minimally invasive approaches  including the treatment of gynecological disorders and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the vasculature 
in addition  mis procedures may be useful for intra organ diagnosis and treatment 
it is estimated that in over million procedures traditionally accomplished through open surgery were performed in the united states using mis techniques 
mis procedure growth is expected to significantly outpace increases in total surgical procedures for the balance of the decade 
it is estimated that more than million surgical procedures performed in were considered to be potential candidates for minimally invasive approaches 
mis access devices a trocar is the conventional device that is used by surgeons to access a possible treatment site in an mis procedure 
a trocar is generally a sharp pointed cutting instrument surrounded by a rigid sheath  or cannula  that is forced through the abdominal wall by the surgeon and cuts through the muscle and skin layers which make up the abdominal wall 
trocar insertion is normally preceded by the insertion of an insufflation inflation needle into the abdominal cavity through which a gas can be pumped to insufflate the abdominal cavity as a means of providing working space and added clearance  such that internal body organs are less likely to be damaged as a sharp bladed trocar is inserted 
once a trocar has penetrated the abdominal wall  the cutting portion of the device is removed  leaving the cannula through which instruments and diagnostic tools can be placed into the abdominal cavity of the patient 
the proximal end of the trocar  which remains outside the body  is normally equipped with a valve system designed to allow the passage of instruments while maintaining insufflation gas pressure 
trocars are most commonly provided in mm  mm and mm working channel sizes  and leave residual wounds which approximate these nominal sizes 
from one to as many as six trocars are used for access in mis procedures depending on the extent and complexity of the particular procedure 
in addition  anchors are frequently used with trocars to assure maintenance of insufflation pressure and to prevent slippage of the trocars as instruments are passed through them during a procedure 
these anchor devices  when used  can enlarge the wound size and increase trauma to adjacent tissues 
trocars consist of two types disposable and reusable 
industry sources estimate that in sales of disposable trocars in the united states totaled approximately to million  and global sales totaled more than million 
reusable trocars are used to a greater extent internationally than in the united states 
reusable trocars must be sharpened from time to time when they become dull 
as a result  a reusable trocar may not consistently and cleanly cut through the muscle and skin layers that make up the abdominal wall 
the potential risk of serious trauma to the patient may be increased because greater pressure can be required to force the trocar through the abdominal wall  causing the abdominal cavity to partially collapse and reduce the space created by insufflation 
in addition  medical personnel that handle and clean reusable trocars are also subject to the risk of cuts and skin punctures because a trocar is a sharp cutting instrument 
another device commonly used in mis procedures is a percutaneous catheter 
a number of minimally invasive percutaneous catheter based therapies have been developed to treat vascular disease  including coronary and peripheral transluminal angioplasty  atherectomy and vascular stenting 
in addition  minimally invasive catheter based diagnostic procedures such as angiography and ultrasound imaging are used by physicians in connection with therapeutic procedures 
industry sources estimate that in approximately million minimally invasive vascular access procedures were performed worldwide 
in addition  approximately million interventional radiology procedures utilizing minimally invasive vascular access were performed in the conventional technique used to access the vasculature suffers from certain drawbacks 
if a physician needs to utilize a device that exceeds the diameter of the introducer sheath  the physician must insert a new sheath with a larger diameter 
depending on the size and number of devices used by the physician  this process can increase the likelihood of trauma to the vessel 
additionally  following catheter based procedures  the physician must close the access site 
in current practice  anticoagulation therapy is generally discontinued for up to four hours prior to closure of the access site to allow the patient s clotting function to normalize 
during this period the patient must remain immobile to prevent bleeding at the access site 
the company believes that a less traumatic means of vascular access could potentially offer advantages over conventional techniques 
advanced mis access devices may also prove useful for intra organ surgical procedures 
the surgical treatment of an organ deep within the abdominal cavity or an organ such as the kidney lying on either side of the vertebral column  posterior to the peritoneum  is typically conducted through open surgery  involving a three to five inch or larger incision that is made in the abdominal wall to gain access to the organ 
open surgery typically requires a hospital stay and a prolonged recovery period 
alternatively  the organ can be treated through a less invasive technique that involves the insertion of a long flexible channel and scope through a natural body orifice such as the mouth or the rectum to gain access to the organ 
however  this technique is limited in its effectiveness due to the restricted size of the channel and the torturous path that must be navigated 
biocompatible coating technologies cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the united states 
atherosclerosis  the principal cause of cardiovascular disease  results from the progressive accumulation of plaque caused by the deposit of cholesterol and other fatty materials on the walls of arteries 
atherosclerosis results in reduced blood flow to the muscles of the heart and peripheral anatomy 
atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries can ultimately lead to heart attack and death 
arteries diseased with atherosclerosis may be treated with medical procedures designed to increase blood flow 
established treatments include open heart surgery  a highly invasive surgical procedure  and less invasive percutaneous catheter based procedures such as coronary and peripheral transluminal angioplasty 
in recent years  a number of new percutaneous catheter based therapies have been developed to increase blood flow  including atherectomy and vascular stenting 
industry sources estimate that during approximately  balloon angioplasty  atherectomy and stenting procedures were performed worldwide 
industry sources also indicate that cardiovascular stenting is increasingly used to treat cardiovascular disease due to its demonstrated ability to reduce the occurrence of restenosis  a re narrowing of a treated blood vessel that typically occurs within six months of treatment in approximately of patients who undergo percutaneous catheter based procedures 
stents are implantable medical devices that reduce arterial obstruction by providing a rigid scaffolding to maintain patency in an occluded blood vessel 
once placed  stents exert radial force against the walls of blood vessels to enable the blood vessels to remain open and functional 
preliminary indications are that restenosis following stenting can be reduced through the coating of stents with radioactivity or anti proliferative drugs 
the company believes that opportunities may exist for companies with technology to effectively coat stents with radiation or anti proliferative drugs 
in recent years there has been a resurgence in the use of interstitial irradiation  or brachytherapy  in the management of clinically localized prostate cancer 
brachytherapy is an established nuclear therapeutic modality in which radiation is introduced into or onto a cancer  and is widely used to successfully treat a variety of cancers  including those of the prostate  breast  cervix  ovary  skin  brain  head and neck 
brachytherapy can be used as a stand alone therapy or used in concert with external beam therapy to boost the dose delivered to the tumor 
brachytherapies involve the use of both sealed and unsealed sources 
among the sealed sources  seeds  wires  and needles using i  pd  and ir are the most commonly used isotopes in therapy for solid tumors 
innerdyne s products and technology radial dilation technology the primary focus of the company is the development and commercial application of its proprietary radial dilation technology 
the key feature of this proprietary technology is the capability to enter the body of a patient by creating a small puncture wound which can subsequently be dilated  or increased in size  to create a larger working channel 
employment of radial dilation within an expandable sheath permits the dilation to be accomplished in a manner that tends to minimize tissue trauma 
upon completion of a procedure  the dilation sequence is reversed  resulting in a smaller residual wound than would be experienced through the employment of similarly sized conventional access devices 
potential benefits of radial dilation technology include reduced risk  less patient trauma and reduced procedure time 
step product line 
the company has developed a family of products utilizing innerdyne s proprietary radial dilation technology 
the initial step products were introduced commercially in late and are designed to provide access to the abdominal cavity in order to facilitate the visualization and treatment of target areas within the cavity while minimizing the tissue trauma associated with such access 
step 
the step device incorporates the company s proprietary radial dilation technology and was innerdyne s first product to be launched on a commercial basis 
the company has received k clearances from the fda to market this device for laparoscopic and thorascopic mis procedures 
the company s step access device replaces trocars  eliminating the risk of internal organ damage from contact with the sharp surfaces of a trocar 
in contrast to conventional trocars  the step device utilizes a standard insufflation needle for penetration through the abdominal wall  creating only a small puncture wound 
following removal of the needle  a sheath that surrounds the needle is then dilated to a larger working channel through the insertion of a tapered dilator and cannula 
following dilation  the dilator is removed  leaving a rigid sheath that serves as a working channel with an integral insufflation valve at the proximal end 
the radial dilation of tissue to an appropriately sized working channel holds the cannula in place and obviates the need for an anchoring system  which may cause a larger residual wound 
after completion of a procedure  the rigid cannula is removed and the sheath retracts permitting the opening in each of the muscular layers of the abdominal wall to recover 
the residual wound is approximately half the size of that made using a conventional trocar of similar size 
the step product is currently utilized primarily in minimally invasive general  gynecological and pediatric surgical procedures 
management believes that positive attributes of the step product could significantly affect health care system costs and patient satisfaction with mis procedures in which trocars have traditionally been used 
the results of a company sponsored retrospective comparative outcome study examining this issue were released during late the study included patients and compared an almost equal number of procedures performed using step devices and conventional trocars for access 
statistically significant results of that study indicated that step reduced device related complications during surgery by over and resulted in an approximate savings in surgery time 
based upon published operating room costs  this time savings would equate to dollar savings of to per procedure  a substantial outcome for a product that is believed to be competitively priced with conventional trocars 
management also believes that post procedure complications  such as infection and incisional hernias at access sites  may be reduced with the use of the step device as compared to conventional trocars 
two randomized prospective studies involving patients intended to replicate the findings of the initial outcome study were completed during results of both studies indicate that step virtually eliminates complications associated with the use of conventional trocars 
these results have been presented at major international conferences and have been submitted for publication 
on january   innerdyne reported the acceptance by the fda of the company s k premarket notification based on the demonstrated safety and clinical performance of the step tm line of minimally invasive surgical access devices based on innerdyne s proprietary radial dilation technology 
the product safety premarket notification resulted from the submittal of substantial information related to the comparative safety of the step radially expanding dilation technology for surgical access versus standard cutting trocars 
the fda clearance acknowledged that the step radially expanding surgical access technology had been shown in independent clinical comparative studies versus conventional cutting trocars to provide safety benefits including  but not limited to a lower prevalence of abdominal wall bleeding  a lower prevalence of bowel and bladder injuries  a lower incidence of post operative incisional hernias  and a lower prevalence of major vascular injury 
in addition  the fda clearance noted that a substantial number of patients reported reduced pain from step access sites when compared to conventional trocar sites 
short step 
the short step is a conventional step device that has been reduced in length to be particularly suitable for mis procedures involving smaller individuals  especially children and thin females 
the short step was commercially introduced in in january  the company announced that its short step device had been awarded the seal of acceptance by the alliance of children s hospitals  inc alliance 
the alliance is a wholly owned subsidiary of child health corporation of america  which is comprised of free standing children s hospitals across the united states 
the alliance selected the step system  after extensive research and review  based upon its ability to reduce both the trauma and operative complications associated with pediatric laparoscopic surgical procedures 
in exchange for an ongoing royalty payment  the company is entitled to use this seal in connection with the marketing and sale of its step line of products 
the company hopes that the seal of acceptance will help the company expand awareness and sales of its step product line for use in the pediatric environment 
reposable step 
launched in  the reposable step incorporates the radial dilation features of disposable step devices in a partially reusable access device 
a substantial market for reusable trocars exists  and management expects a trend toward a somewhat more frequent usage of reusable devices 
the reposable step includes a number of reusable components consisting of a combination of metal and plastic parts that may be cleaned and sterilized by most conventional methods 
the dilator  cannula and needle are reusable  while the sheath and valve are single use components designed to be disposed of following surgery 
mini step 
the mini step is a small diameter radially dilating access device designed for use in tubal ligation  pediatric procedures  and micro laparoscopic surgeries utilizing small instruments 
the working diameter of the mini step ranges from a nominal mm to mm 
like the step device  mini step is expected to offer clinicians the potential to reduce device related surgical complications and surgery time 
the mini step devices were commercially introduced in one step 
the one step is a device with a universally adjustable valve and seal system designed to eliminate the need for a reducer 
the device is intended to maintain insufflation while accommodating most conventional surgical instruments 
the one step device was commercially introduced in open step 
the open step is a device designed to establish access into the abdominal cavity using a technique known as open laparoscopy 
the open step device was commercially introduced in distribution of step products 
the step family of products is distributed to health care professionals in both domestic and international markets 
in the united states  the company s mis access product line is generally sold directly to health care professionals by a network of sales representatives  a limited number of whom are employees of the company 
innerdyne management employees manage these sales representatives on a regional basis 
in order to enhance the effectiveness of these domestic sales activities  agreements with buying groups that represent multiple provider institutions have been pursued 
innerdyne signed two buying group agreements in these agreements cover approximately  hospitals across the united states 
in selected foreign countries  local distributors purchase products from the company for subsequent resale to their respective countries health care systems 
distributors in selected foreign markets can and have been changed when the company has deemed the performance of individual distributor organizations to be unsatisfactory 
other applications 
during the second quarter of  innerdyne established a business unit to better define the value that radial dilation technology can bring to interventional cardiology and radiology procedures and to develop access products based on this assessment 
the company proceeded with animal studies and device refinements in the third and fourth quarters of and continued testing the product concept in conjunction with cardiology advisors in the first quarter of the study results were positive and human use trials to demonstrate the clinical benefits were initiated in europe during the second quarter of in september  innerdyne announced that it had received clearance from the fda of a k application for its radially dilatable access device for use in gaining percutaneous access for the performance of vascular procedures 
if clinical benefits are confirmed in continuing usage  the company will explore alternative methods of effective distribution in the interventional vascular marketplace and may launch a radial dilation vascular access device in the united states in or subsequent years 
management believes that the positive attributes of the step product line may also enable minimally invasive access to organs within the abdominal cavity 
the only current alternative for this type of access involves the insertion of a long flexible channel and scope through a natural body orifice such as the mouth or the rectum  and only limited procedures are possible due to the restricted size of the channel and the tortuous path that must be navigated 
the step product line has been shown to enable laparoscopic access through the abdominal wall and across the peritoneal space into the stomach for the treatment of benign tumors 
innerdyne believes that the use of step products could substantially reduce recovery times for these types of procedures 
the company expects that the enhanced capabilities of radially expanding dilation may enable additional surgical procedures to be performed through minimally invasive techniques 
the company may file an additional k with respect to intra organ access in the company anticipates that market evaluation and testing of the product concept in conjunction with surgical advisors will be concluded in late if the trial results are positive and subsequent human use demonstrates clinical benefits  the company may begin distribution in the marketplace and may launch an intra organ access device during or in subsequent years 
additionally  the company is exploring the potential use of its proprietary radial dilation technology in other applications such as access for urologic  thoracic and tracheal procedures  and plans to increase resources associated with the pursuit of percutaneous kidney and bladder access in the ensuing quarters 
the company filed an additional k for urologic access in developmental expenditures for new applications for the company s proprietary radial dilation technology may reduce the company s level of profitability 
there can be no assurance that these new applications will demonstrate clinical benefits or that the company can develop a product that will be commercially accepted 
innerdyne announced an agreement covering the development and potential use of its proprietary radial dilation technology for specialized vascular access with endotex interventional systems endotex in in january  the management of endotex notified innerdyne that it was ceasing to make payments required for endotex to use radial dilation for specialized vascular access 
the company does not expect the termination of the endotex agreement to have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company entered into an agreement covering the development of a less traumatic means of placing enteral feeding tubes with sherwood davis geck sdg in the company announced that it had received the single regulatory milestone payment associated with the sdg agreement during the second quarter of in the first quarter of  innerdyne and sdg terminated the development agreement when sdg was acquired 
in the future  the company may continue to develop a feeding tube placement system 
innerdyne also committed resources to an investigation of the potential market opportunity in arthroscopic procedures during and early limited clinical usage of the initial design accompanied by substantial exposure and feedback from arthroscopic surgeons was completed during the last half of innerdyne completed the arthroscopic market opportunity assessment in the second quarter of the company is exploring the potential this product may have  if any  and alternative distribution methods in the arthroscopic marketplace 
it is unlikely that an arthroscopic access product will be brought to market unless a suitable distribution partner can be found 
thermal ablation technology the company has developed proprietary technology that is intended to thermally ablate the lining of a body organ 
the company s enabl tm thermal ablation system the enabl system is based on this proprietary technology and is designed to treat menorrhagia  or excessive uterine bleeding  by thermally ablating the endometrial lining of the uterus through the controlled introduction and heating of a normal saline solution in situ 
in december  innerdyne announced that it had signed an agreement which granted us surgical corporation us surgical exclusive worldwide sales and marketing rights for the enabl system 
under the terms of the agreement  in exchange for initial license fees  milestone payments  and royalties based upon future sales  us surgical gained the rights to complete development of the enabl system and to manufacture and market the technology on a worldwide basis 
the agreement also provides us surgical with an option to purchase rights to the technology for defined applications 
in july  the company announced that us surgical had made the first milestone payment due under the terms of the agreement 
in august  innerdyne announced it had received notification from u 
s 
surgical indicating they would not pursue development or commercialization of the company s enabl system 
the company does not presently intend to proceed with commercial development of this product without a corporate partner 
biocompatible coating technologies the company possesses certain proprietary technologies in the area of biocompatible coatings 
the technologies that comprise the company s thromboresistant coating trc capability are believed to have application when foreign objects remain in contact with various areas of the body  particularly within the blood stream  for sustained periods of time 
these technologies include the ability to deposit an extremely thin layer approximately one micron of siloxane on a surface and the ability to graft a bioactive substance  such as the drug heparin  to that siloxane layer 
the company s trc utilizes a tether molecule to attach heparin  other bioactive molecules or radioisotopes to the previously applied siloxane subsurface 
one end of the tether molecule is covalently bonded to the siloxane coating and the other end of the tether molecule is covalently bonded to the bioactive molecule or radioisotope 
because both points of attachment utilize covalent bonds  the company believes that its coating process may result in a stronger bond to the surface of a device than many other methods presently in use  which it believes generally use a weaker ionic bond in at least one of the attachment points 
trc coatings  employed with the siloxane layer alone or in combination with bioactive substances  can extend the life of blood gas exchange devices or provide the capability to extend the duration of contact of a coated device with blood or other body fluids while minimizing the physiological impacts of such contact 
innerdyne is developing a proprietary technology that coats materials with a coating to which rhenium or another radioisotope can be attached to reduce restenosis in patients who have had interventional vascular procedures 
the company has begun a research program aimed at developing absorbable brachytherapy products for the treatment of focal or site specific cancers such as breast  prostate  cervical  and neurological cancers 
the program s goal is to develop biocompatible and bio absorbable brachytherapy sources for use in radiotherapy or simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy drug delivery 
these novel combined brachytherapy chemotherapeutic drug sources are being designed for use in the local regional treatment of primary cancer  including treatment of the tumor bed after removal of a tumor 
the final product could fundamentally differ from both current brachytherapy sources and drug delivery sources and could provide a highly efficient mechanism to control cancer growth and limit cancer reccurrence 
the advantage of localized radiotherapy over other therapies is that local radiotherapy can eliminate cancerous cells while sparing normal cells 
other therapies  such as systemic chemotherapy and external beam radiation  affect both cancerous and non cancerous cells and can result in greater pain  longer recovery times  and higher treatment costs 
in contrast  local radiotherapy can lower the cost of the therapeutic procedure  reduce hospital stays  and reduce the pain and suffering experienced by the patient 
in december  innerdyne and oak ridge national laboratory ornl announced that the department of energy had awarded ornl and brookhaven national laboratories bnl a cooperative research and development agreement crada for the development of innerdyne s proprietary method of labeling or attaching radioactivity to implantable devices 
initially  the ornl researchers helped to optimize chemical methods required to efficiently attach a radioactive source to stents 
generators from ornl and the new technology were provided to investigators at bnl who  in conjunction with the interventional cardiology group at the state university of new york at stonybrook  prepared radioactive stents and implanted them into the arteries of swine and rabbits to evaluate the effectiveness of this unique and potentially powerful new approach to inhibit restenosis 
initial testing confirmed the company s ability to attach radionuclides to metal stents and other substrates 
additional testing to demonstrate the efficacy in animals of innerdyne s technology for the treatment of restenosis continues at the washington heart center whc and bnl 
in october  the crada s scope of work was modified to include the development of absorbable brachytherapy devices for the treatment of focal cancers because of the rapid strides made under the radiation coated stent development program 
management believes that the combination of innerdyne and oak ridge national laboratory technologies  if successful  may positively impact the overall costs associated with stenting procedures by providing a method of attaching a radioisotope just prior to implantation to inhibit restenosis 
additionally  management believes that an absorbable brachytherapy device which can deliver both radiation and a drug or chemotherapy agent concurrently could positively impact the treatment outcomes of focal cancers by lowering the cost of the therapeutic procedure  reducing hospital stays  and reducing the pain and suffering experienced by the patient 
in january  innerdyne announced that it had been awarded a california cancer research program crp cycle i grant  a community initiated research collaboration award circa  to examine the clinical benefits and the development of absorbable brachytherapy devices 
the commercial objective of this project is to develop bioabsorbable brachytherapy sources for use in radiotherapy or simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy drug delivery 
these novel combined brachytherapy chemotherapeutic drug sources will be designed utilizing a proprietary innerdyne technology for potential use in the treatment of site specific prostate  breast  and neurological cancers 
in  the company signed a license agreement with senko medical manufacturing co  ltd 
senko  a japan based manufacturer and marketer of membrane oxygenators used in open heart surgery  pursuant to which the company licensed one of its trc technologies to senko 
in connection with this agreement  the company transferred its siloxane coating technology to senko for the coating of microporous hollow fibers used in production of oxygenators 
the initial technology transfer was completed during the first quarter of  at which time the company received the balance of an initial payment from senko  and the royalty payment period commenced 
in  innerdyne received an order from senko to build a second fiber coating system which was delivered during the first half of in april  senko licensed innerdyne s less complex method for coating devices with heparin on a non exclusive basis 
the addition of this new means of attaching the drug heparin to prevent the formation of blood clots on a surface is expected to further enhance senko s oxygenator product offering 
in april  the company announced the signing of an agreement with boston scientific corporation boston scientific covering the potential application and use of innerdyne s proprietary biocompatible coating technologies with boston scientific s stents  grafts  vena cava filters and other implantable medical devices 
the agreement involved an equity investment by boston scientific in innerdyne  initial research support and future license fees and royalty payments 
boston scientific corporation notified innerdyne in august that it had decided to proceed with the transfer of technology for the application and use of innerdyne s proprietary biocompatible coating technology with boston scientific s stents  grafts  vena cava filters  and other implantable medical devices 
the transfer of the technology is expected to be completed during  though the company may continue to conduct related research if requested by boston scientific 
in june  innerdyne announced the signing of an agreement with us surgical covering the licensing of innerdyne s proprietary siloxane coating technology to enhance the performance of selected products used in minimally invasive surgical procedures 
under the terms of the agreement  innerdyne will construct a custom coating system and provide coated product samples for testing by us surgical in exchange for payment of initial license fees and capital equipment costs 
assuming the testing confirms that coated samples meet us surgical s requirements  innerdyne will receive a final license fee payment and will assist in the transfer of the system to a location designated by us surgical 
coincident with transfer and system startup  a royalty payment period would begin 
because of the strength of the covalent bonds used in the company s trc technology and other properties noted above  the company believes that its technology may have advantages over presently available bioactive coating technologies 
potential applications include the treatment of restenosis and specific focal cancers when vascular stents  grafts  vena cava filters and other implantable devices are coated using innerdyne s proprietary technology with drugs and or isotopes 
the company has undertaken a number of discussions with potential licensees of the company s coating technologies  and samples of coated products have been provided to several companies 
these discussions have been with parties interested in the use of the technologies to enhance drug delivery or gas exchange  as well as third parties interested in the possible coating of in dwelling devices for various applications 
research and development the company has made significant investments in the research and development of its proprietary technologies  including radial dilation  thermal ablation and biocompatible coatings 
research  development  clinical and regulatory expenses for the years ended december    and were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the increases in and were primarily the result of expenses related to new product development programs  including costs associated with development  clinical trials and regulatory submissions 
the decrease in is primarily the result of a decrease in the reimbursed development expenses related to the enabl thermal ablation system 
as of december   the company had full time employees engaged in research  development  clinical and regulatory activities 
currently  the company s research and development efforts are primarily focused on providing support for the step product line  other access products based on innerdyne s proprietary radial dilation technology  the revas vascular access product  and biocompatible coating technologies 
in december  innerdyne announced that it had signed an agreement granting us surgical exclusive worldwide sales and marketing rights for the enabl system 
in august  innerdyne announced it had received notification from u 
s 
surgical indicating they would not pursue development or commercialization of the company s enabl system 
the company does not presently intend to proceed with commercial development of this product without a corporate partner 
in december  innerdyne and oak ridge national laboratory announced that the department of energy had awarded ornl and brookhaven national laboratories a cooperative research and development agreement crada to support development of innerdyne s proprietary method of labeling or attaching radioactivity to implantable devices 
the company s proprietary biocompatible coating technologies have been evaluated by a number of potential licensees 
agreements are in place with senko covering the coating of gas exchange fibers  with boston scientific for the potential coating of stents  grafts  vena cava filters and other implantable devices  and with us surgical covering the licensing of its proprietary siloxane coating technology for potential use by us surgical to enhance the performance of selected products used in minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the future success of the company will depend upon its ability to develop and gain regulatory clearance for new and enhanced versions of products in a timely fashion 
in addition  the company may seek to identify opportunities to obtain products or technologies from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop or acquire new products or technologies  license its proprietary technologies to third parties  obtain regulatory clearance for its products  or gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products 
delays in development  clearance or acceptance of new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales and marketing the company is marketing its mis access products mainly to general surgeons  gynecologists and pediatric laparoscopists 
the step family of products is distributed to health care professionals in both domestic and international markets 
in the united states  the company s mis access product line is generally sold directly to health care professionals by a network of sales representatives  a limited number of which are employees of the company 
innerdyne sales marketing management manages the sales representatives on a regional basis 
to enhance the effectiveness of these domestic sales activities  agreements with buying groups that represent multiple provider institutions have been pursued 
innerdyne signed two buying group agreements in the third quarter of these agreements cover approximately  hospitals across the united states and may allow the company to more effectively compete for a portion of the minimally invasive surgical access business in these hospitals 
in selected foreign countries  local distributors purchase products from the company for subsequent resale to their respective country s health care systems and medical professionals 
distributors in selected foreign markets can and have been changed when the company has deemed the performance of individual distributor organizations to be unsatisfactory 
as of december   orders had been received from distributors in countries 
management expects to make additional progress in this regard during and expects foreign sales to positively impact future revenue growth 
the company has limited experience in marketing its products and faces substantial competition from well entrenched and formidable competitors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully achieve acceptable levels of product sales at prices that provide an adequate return or that the company will be able to build a network of international distributors capable of effectively marketing its mis access products or that such distributors will generate significant sales of such products 
failure to do so would have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
manufacturing the company initiated manufacture of commercial quantities of its step device in its salt lake city  utah facility in late current manufacturing operations consist primarily of the assembly and testing of purchased components to produce finished products  which are then packaged for sterilization in an outside facility 
the company has implemented steps to automate selected portions of the step assembly operation to help reduce product costs and to achieve a more uniform standard of product consistency 
during the assembly process and following sterilization  the company conducts appropriate tests and inspection of its products in an effort to assure that products meet established specifications and to verify appropriate levels of product sterility 
the company has limited experience in manufacturing mis access products or other products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs 
the company is registered as a manufacturer of medical devices with appropriate state and federal authorities  including the fda  and is registered to international standards organization iso standards  which confirms compliance with a number of foreign quality systems 
see government regulation 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with the fda s gmp regulations  and iso and other regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
failure to maintain or increase production volumes in a timely or cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory changes currently being introduced by the fda are likely to result in a system of united states regulatory requirements for manufacturers of medical devices which more closely resembles the iso series of quality systems standards adopted by most european countries 
the company s iso registration is expected to aid efforts to achieve compliance with revised united states regulatory requirements 
the materials utilized in the company s mis products consist of both standard and custom components that are purchased from a variety of independent sources 
the plastic parts used in the step product are injection molded by outside vendors 
the majority of these parts are produced utilizing molds that have been specially machined for and are owned by the company 
although the company maintains significant inventories of molded parts  any inability to utilize these molds for any reason might have a material adverse effect upon the company s ability to meet its customer s demand for product 
in addition to plastic parts produced from injection molds owned by the company  a number of other materials are available only from a limited number of sources at the present time  including the sheath component of the company s step products 
efforts to identify and qualify additional sources of this sheath component and other key materials and components are continuing 
although innerdyne believes that alternative sources of these components can be obtained  internal testing and qualification of substitute vendors could require significant lead times and additional regulatory submissions 
there can be no assurance that such internal testing and qualification or additional regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely fashion  if at all 
any interruption of supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products  and therefore on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors dependence on sole sources 
patents and proprietary rights it is the company s policy to aggressively protect its technology by  among other things  filing patent applications for the patentable technologies that it considers important to the development of its business 
the company holds eleven issued united states patents covering various aspects of its core mis technology 
the company also has a license agreement giving it exclusive rights  assuming certain defined minimum payments are met  to a related access technology that is covered by two issued and one pending patent 
in addition  during  the company obtained a non exclusive license to a patent covering a specialized access device which facilitates the placement of a vision device into the abdominal cavity 
the company holds eight issued united states patents relating to its thermal ablation system technology 
the company also holds five issued united states patents relating to its biocompatible coating technologies 
the company has continued to pursue the expansion of its coating related intellectual property as opportunities for business partnerships in this area have been pursued 
see innerdyne s products and technology biocompatible coating technologies 
the company also holds a number of issued foreign patents  and has filed additional united states and foreign patent applications relating to its various technologies 
in addition to patent rights related to its radial dilation  thermal ablation and biocompatible coating technologies  the company also has a number of issued and pending patents relating to its blood gas exchange  pumping and other technologies 
there can be no assurances that any pending patent applications will be issued in their present scope  or at all 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain patent protection for products and processes  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
although innerdyne has obtained certain patents and applied for additional united states and foreign patents covering certain aspects of its technology  no assurance can be given that any additional patents will be issued or that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide a competitive advantage  or that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain 
innerdyne also relies upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets 
in addition  whether or not the company s patents are issued  others may hold or receive patents that contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by innerdyne 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry  and companies in the medical device industry have used litigation to gain competitive advantage 
litigation involving the company would result in substantial cost to and diversion of management attention from the day to day operation of the business  but could be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets and other specialized knowledge unknown to outside parties  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties under less favorable terms than might otherwise be possible and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  receive correspondence from third parties claiming that the company s products or technology infringe intellectual property rights of such third parties 
the company and its patent counsel thoroughly review such claims  and no such outstanding claims currently exist 
however  there can be no assurance that innerdyne will not receive additional claims that its products or technology infringe third party rights or that third parties will not litigate such claims 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

competition the primary industry in which the company competes  minimally invasive surgery  is dominated by two large  well positioned entities that are intensely competitive and frequently offer substantial discounts as a competitive tactic  us surgical and the ethicon endosurgery division of johnson and johnson ethicon 
us surgical  which has been acquired by tyco international ltd  is primarily engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing surgical wound management products  and had historically been the firm most responsible for providing products that led to the growth of the industry 
us surgical supplies a broad line of products to the mis industry  including products that facilitate access  assessment and treatment 
the merger with tyco is expected to significantly expand the combined product offering to the mis industry 
ethicon has made a major investment in the mis field in recent years and the parent company is one of the leading suppliers of hospital products in the world 
furthermore  us surgical and ethicon each utilize purchasing contracts that link discounts on the purchase of one product to purchases of other products in their broad product lines 
substantially all of the hospitals in the united states have purchasing contracts with one or both of these entities 
accordingly  customers may be dissuaded from purchasing access products from the company rather than us surgical or ethicon to the extent it would cause them to lose discounts on products that they regularly purchase from us surgical or ethicon 
notwithstanding the challenges faced by the company in selling into a market dominated by two large competitors  the majority of the company s revenues since the fourth quarter of have come from product sales in this market 
us surgical and ethicon purchasing contracts typically include provisions allowing a certain percentage of purchases from other vendors  or permitting new technology products to be considered outside of a purchasing agreement 
the company has taken and intends to continue to take advantage of such provisions 
the company faces a formidable task in gaining significant revenues within the mis access market 
in order to succeed  management believes that the company will need to objectively demonstrate substantial product benefits  and its sales effort must be able to effectively present such benefits to both clinicians and health care administrators 
the mis access market segment is dominated by us surgical and ethicon 
both entities introduced new access devices with added features during the past two years 
a number of other entities participate in various segments of the mis access market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the mis access market  and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technologies or products obsolete or not competitive 
such competition could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors intense competition 
government regulation clinical testing  manufacture and sale of the company s products  including the step product line  the revas product line and the company s biocompatible coating technology  are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
in the united states  medical devices are classified into one of three classes ie  class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness 
class i devices are subject to general controls eg  labeling  premarket notification and adherence to gmp s and class ii devices are subject to general and special controls eg  performance standards  postmarket surveillance  patient registries and fda guidelines 
generally  class iii devices are those which must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness eg  life sustaining  life supporting and implantable devices  or new devices which have been found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices 
before a new device can be introduced in the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain fda clearance of a k notification or approval of a premarket approval pma application 
a pma application must be filed if a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii device for which the fda has called for pmas 
the pma application must contain the results of clinical trials  the results of all relevant bench tests  laboratory and animal studies  a complete description of the device and its components  and a detailed description of the methods  facilities and controls used to manufacture the device 
the fda s review of a pma application generally takes one to two years from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but it may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended by the fda asking for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma  its labeling or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pma supplements or new pmas 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
if human clinical trials of a device are required and the device presents a significant risk  the sponsor of the trial usually the manufacturer or the distributor of the device will have to file an investigational device exemption ide application prior to commencing human clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irb s  human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents an insignificant risk to the patient  a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs without the need for fda approval 
sponsors of clinical trials are permitted to sell investigational devices distributed in the course of the study provided such compensation does not exceed recovery of the costs of manufacture  research  development and handling 
an ide supplement must be submitted to and approved by the fda before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii medical device or a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for pma s 
the fda recently has been requiring more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past  including in some cases requiring submission of clinical trial data 
the fda may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device  or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
it generally takes from two to twelve months from submission to obtain k premarket clearance  but may take longer 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could prevent or delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for any of the company s devices cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new k submission 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain k premarket clearance within a reasonable time frame  or at all  for any of the devices or modifications for which it may file a k 
the company has received clearance from the fda for the marketing of its step device for use in accessing the abdominal and thoracic cavities for the performance of minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company has also received fda clearance for the marketing of its radially expanding dilator red product for use in the areas of gastrostomy  cystostomy  cholecystotomy  the dilation of biliary and urethral strictures  laparoscopy and enterostomy 
the company has also received market clearance for alternative versions of its step and red products  including products designed to employ its radial dilation technology in vascular and arthroscopic applications and for biliary indications 
although the company has been successful in preparing requests for k clearance  there can be no assurance that k clearances for future products or product modifications can be obtained in a timely manner  or at all  or that any existing clearance can be successfully maintained 
a delay in receipt of  or failure to receive or maintain  such clearances would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company is strictly limited to marketing its products for the indications for which they were cleared  physicians are not prohibited by the fda from using the products for indications other than those cleared by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the company will not become subject to fda action resulting from physician use of its products outside of their approved indications 
the company has made modifications to its cleared devices that the company believes do not require the submission of new k notices 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with any of the company s determinations not to submit a new k notice for any of these changes or would not require the company to submit a new k notice for any of the changes made to the device 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
any devices manufactured or distributed by the company pursuant to fda clearance or approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies and various foreign governments 
manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the united states are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed gmp requirements  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
manufacturers must also comply with medical device reporting mdr requirements that a firm report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
the company is registered as a manufacturer of medical devices with the fda 
the company is subject to routine inspection by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with gmp requirements  mdr requirements and other applicable regulations 
failure of the company to maintain satisfactory gmp compliance could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products and  in the most serious cases  result in the seizure or recall of products  injunctions and or civil fines 
the fda has proposed and is implementing changes to the gmp regulations that may increase the cost of compliance with gmp requirements 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future or that laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has received certification to iso standards  permitting it to affix the ce mark to its products  allowing unencumbered movement of its products within the european union 
the company is required to undergo periodic surveillance audits to assure continuing compliance with these standards 
failure to demonstrate satisfactory compliance on an ongoing basis could adversely impact innerdyne s ability to distribute its products within the european union 
product liability and insurance the development  manufacturing and sale of the company s products entail the risk of product liability claims  involving both potential financial exposure and associated adverse publicity 
to date  innerdyne has not experienced any product liability claims 
the company s current product liability insurance coverage limits are  per occurrence and  in the aggregate  and there can be no assurance that such coverage limits are adequate to protect the company from any liabilities it might incur in connection with the development  manufacture  and sale of its current and potential products 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if such insurance is available  there can be no assurance that the limits of coverage of such policies will be adequate 
a successful product liability claim in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

background innerdyne  inc the company or innerdyne is primarily focused upon the development and commercialization of access products based on its proprietary radial dilation technology used to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company possesses biocompatible coating technologies which have utility in enhancing the compatibility and performance of devices placed in contact with human body fluids and tissues  and in delivering selected pharmaceuticals and radioactive isotopes to areas within a human body 
the company intends to continue developing its radial dilation and biocompatible coating technologies  internally or through strategic alliances 
risk factors history of losses  profitability uncertain 
innerdyne experienced operating losses from into mid innerdyne reported net income of  on revenues of million  and losses of  on revenues of million  and million on revenues of for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   innerdyne had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in the future  the company may incur additional operating losses and have cash outflow requirements as a result of expenditures related to expansion of sales and marketing capability  expansion of manufacturing capacity  research and development activities  compliance with regulatory requirements  and possible investment in or acquisition of additional complementary products  technologies or businesses 
the timing and amounts of these expenditures will depend upon many factors  such as the availability of capital  progress of the company s research and development  and factors that may be beyond the company s control  such as the results of product trials  the requirements for and the time required to obtain regulatory approval for existing products and any other products that may be developed or acquired  and the market acceptance of the company s products 
the cash needs of the company have changed significantly as a result of the merger completed during and the support requirements of the added business focus areas 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur future losses  that the company will be able to raise cash as necessary to fund operations or that the company will maintain profitability 
intense competition 
the primary industry in which the company competes  minimally invasive surgery  is dominated by two large  well positioned entities that are intensely competitive and frequently offer substantial discounts as a competitive tactic 
us surgical is primarily engaged in developing  manufacturing and marketing surgical wound management products  and has historically been the firm most responsible for providing products that have led to the growth of the industry 
us surgical supplies a broad line of products to the mis industry  including products which facilitate access  assessment and treatment 
ethicon has made a major investment in the mis field in recent years and is one of the leading suppliers of hospital products in the world 
furthermore  us surgical and ethicon each utilize purchasing contracts that link discounts on the purchase of one product to purchases of other products in their broad product lines 
substantially all of the hospitals in the united states have purchasing contracts with one or both of these entities 
accordingly  customers may be dissuaded from purchasing access products from the company rather than us surgical or ethicon to the extent it would cause them to lose discounts on products that they regularly purchase from us surgical or ethicon 
the company faces a formidable task in successfully gaining significant revenues within the mis access market 
in order to succeed  management believes that the company will need to objectively demonstrate substantial product benefits  and its sales effort must be able to effectively present such benefits to both clinicians and health care administrators 
the mis access market is dominated by us surgical and ethicon 
both entities introduced new access devices during the past two years 
a number of other entities participate in various segments of the mis market  including access 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete in the mis access market  and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technologies or products obsolete or not competitive 
such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the entry of large and small companies into the market  the company expects competition for devices to increase 
see item business competition 
continued dependence on step products 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenues from product sales are attributable to step products  and innerdyne currently anticipates that sales of step products will represent the majority of the company s revenues for the immediate future 
accordingly  the success of the company is largely dependent upon increased market acceptance of its step product line by the medical community as a reliable  safe and cost effective access product for minimally invasive surgery 
innerdyne commenced commercial sales of its step product in the fourth quarter of and  to date  sales have been made to a relatively limited number of physicians and hospitals 
recommendations and endorsements by influential members of the medical community are important for the increased market acceptance of the company s step products  and there can be no assurance that existing recommendations or endorsements will be maintained or that new ones will be obtained 
failure to increase market acceptance of the company s step products would have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business innerdyne s products and technology 
reliance on future products and new applications  uncertainty of technology changes 
the medical device industry is characterized by innovation and technological change 
the company has made significant investments in researching and developing its proprietary technologies  including radial dilation and biocompatible coatings 
during  the company expects to commercially introduce an intra organ product  and possibly the revas vascular access product  each of which is a further enhancement of its radial dilation technology 
the future success of the company will depend in part on the timely commercial introduction and market acceptance of these and other possible products 
there can be no assurance that these products will be timely introduced in commercial quantities  if at all  or that such products will achieve market acceptance 
a failure by the company to timely introduce such products or a failure of such products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the future success of the company will also depend upon  among other factors  the ability to develop and gain regulatory clearance for new and enhanced versions of products in a timely fashion 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully develop new products or technologies  manufacture new products in commercial volumes  obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis or gain market acceptance of such products 
delays in development  manufacturing  regulatory approval or market acceptance of new or enhanced products could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business research and development 
limited manufacturing experience  compliance with good manufacturing practices 
the company initiated manufacture of commercial quantities of its step access device in its salt lake city  utah facility during late accordingly  the company has limited experience in manufacturing mis access products or other products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with the fda s gmp regulations and other regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel 
in connection with its iso certification  innerdyne now undergoes periodic audits by a regulatory body 
the company believes that regulatory changes currently being introduced by the fda will result in a system of united states regulatory requirements for manufacturers of medical devices which more closely resembles the iso series of quality systems standards adopted by most european countries 
failure to maintain satisfactory regulatory system compliance could have a significant impact on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products and  in the most serious cases  result in the seizure or recall of products 
failure to maintain production volumes or increase production volumes in a timely or cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business manufacturing 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future depending on the timing and shipment of product orders  new product introductions and changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  the timing and market acceptance of the company s new products and product enhancements  the continued market acceptance of innerdyne s step product line by the medical community  the company s product mix  the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  the extent to which the company recognizes non product revenues during a quarter  and the company s ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for its products 
in particular  fluctuations in production volumes affect gross margins from quarter to quarter 
furthermore  gross margins and net income or loss can fluctuate from quarter to quarter to the extent the company recognizes non product revenue during a quarter because the company typically derives higher margins from non product revenue than from product sales 
in response to competitive pressures or new product introductions  the company may take certain pricing or other actions that could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition  new product introductions by the company could contribute to quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations of future revenues 
because a substantial portion of the company s revenue in each quarter normally results from orders booked and shipped in the final weeks of that quarter  revenue levels are extremely difficult to predict 
if revenue levels are below expectations  net income will be disproportionately affected because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with its revenue during any particular quarter 
in addition  the company typically does not operate with any material backlog as of any particular date 
as a result of the foregoing factors and potential fluctuations in operating results  results of operations in any particular quarter should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
in addition  in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on collaborative relationships  restrictions on activities 
the company has entered into  and intends to continue to pursue  collaborative arrangements with corporations and research institutions with respect to the research  development  regulatory approval and marketing of certain of its potential products 
innerdyne s future success may depend  in part  on its relationship with such third parties  their strategic interest in the potential products under development and  eventually  their success in marketing or willingness to purchase any such products 
the company s existing and anticipated contracts with such third parties may restrict the rights of innerdyne to engage in certain areas of product development  manufacturing and marketing 
in addition  these third parties may have the unilateral right to terminate any such arrangement without significant penalty 
there can be no assurance that innerdyne will be successful in establishing or maintaining any such collaborative arrangements or that any such arrangements will be successful 
limited sales  marketing and distribution experience 
innerdyne began commercial sales of its first mis access product in the fourth quarter of and  therefore  has limited sales  marketing and distribution experience 
the company is marketing its mis access products mainly to general surgeons  gynecologists and pediatric laparoscopists 
in the united states  innerdyne markets its products primarily through direct representatives who are employed by the company within selected geographical areas and a network of independent sales representatives who typically sell other complementary mis products to the same customer base 
if the need arises  the company may expand its sales force  which will require recruiting and training additional personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and train such additional personnel in a timely fashion 
loss of a significant number of innerdyne s current sales personnel or independent sales representatives  or failure to attract additional personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company markets its products outside of the united states through international distributors in selected foreign countries after regulatory approvals  if necessary  are obtained 
although innerdyne currently has relationships with a limited number of international distributors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to build a network of international distributors capable of effectively marketing its mis access products or that such distributors will generate significant sales of such products 
the company has limited experience in marketing its products and faces substantial competition from well entrenched and formidable competitors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will successfully achieve acceptable levels of product sales at prices which provide an adequate return 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to obtain patent protection for products and processes  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
although innerdyne has obtained certain patents and applied for additional united states and foreign patents covering certain aspects of its technology  no assurance can be given that any additional patents will be issued or that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide a competitive advantage  or that any of the company s patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involves complex legal and factual questions and therefore may be highly uncertain 
innerdyne also relies upon unpatented trade secrets  and no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent trade secrets 
in addition  whether or not the company s patents are issued  others may hold or receive patents that contain claims having a scope that covers products developed by innerdyne 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry  and companies in the medical device industry have used litigation to gain competitive advantage 
litigation involving the company would result in substantial cost to and diversion of management attention from the day to day operation of the business  but could be necessary to enforce patents issued to the company  to protect trade secrets and other specialized knowledge unknown to outside parties  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
an adverse determination in litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties under less favorable terms than might otherwise be possible and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  receive correspondence from third parties claiming that the company s products or technology infringe intellectual property rights of such third parties 
the company and its patent counsel thoroughly review such claims and no such outstanding claims currently exist 
however  there can be no assurance that innerdyne will not receive additional claims that its products or technology infringe third party rights or that third parties will not litigate such claims 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

government regulation 
clinical testing  manufacture and sale of the company s products  including the step product line  and the company s biocompatible coating technology  are subject to regulation by the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by the company 
before a new device can be introduced in the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain fda clearance of k notification or approval of a pma 
a pma application must be filed if a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii device for which the fda has called for pmas 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii medical device or a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for pmas 
for any of the company s devices cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require a new k submission 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain k premarket clearance within a reasonable time frame  or at all  for any of the devices or modifications for which it may file a k 
the company has received clearance from the fda for the marketing of its step device for use in accessing the abdominal and thoracic cavities for the performance of minimally invasive surgical procedures 
the company has also received fda clearance for the marketing of its red product for use in the areas of gastrostomy  cystostomy  cholecystotomy  the dilation of biliary and urethral strictures  laparoscopy and enterostomy 
the company has also received market clearance for alternative versions of its step and red products  including products designed to employ its radial dilation technology in vascular and arthroscopic applications and for biliary indications 
although the company has been successful in preparing requests for k clearance  there can be no assurance that k clearances for future products or product modifications can be obtained in a timely manner or at all  or that any existing clearance can be successfully maintained 
a delay in receipt of  or failure to receive or maintain  such clearances would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company is strictly limited to marketing its products for the indications for which they were cleared  physicians are not prohibited by the fda from using the products for indications other than those cleared by the fda 
there can be no assurance that the company will not become subject to fda action resulting from physician use of its products outside of their approved indications 
the company has made modifications to its cleared devices that the company believes do not require the submission of new k notices 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with any of the company s determinations not to submit a new k notice for any of these changes or would not require the company to submit a new k notice for any of the changes made to the device 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
any devices manufactured or distributed by the company pursuant to fda clearance or approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies and various foreign governments 
manufacturers of medical devices for marketing in the united states are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed gmp requirements  which include testing  control and documentation requirements 
manufacturers must also comply with requirements that a firm report to the fda any incident in which its product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which its product malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
the company is registered as a manufacturer of medical devices with the fda 
the company is subject to routine inspection by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with gmp requirements  mdr requirements and other applicable regulations 
failure of the company to maintain satisfactory gmp compliance could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products and  in the most serious cases  could result in the seizure or recall of products  injunctions and or civil fines 
see item business manufacturing and government regulation 
dependence on sole sources 
the materials utilized in the company s mis products consist of both standard and custom components that are purchased from a variety of independent sources 
the plastic parts used in the step product are injection molded by outside vendors 
the majority of these parts are produced utilizing molds that have been specially machined for and are owned by the company 
although the company maintains significant inventories of molded parts  any inability to utilize these molds for any reason might have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its customer s demand for product 
in addition to plastic parts produced from injection molds owned by the company  a number of other materials are available only from a limited number of sources at the present time  including the sheath component of the company s step products 
efforts to identify and qualify additional sources of this sheath component and other key materials and components are underway 
although innerdyne believes that alternative sources of these components can be obtained  internal testing and qualification of substitute vendors could require significant lead times and additional regulatory submissions 
there can be no assurance that such internal testing and qualification or additional regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely fashion  if at all 
any interruption of supply of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products and  therefore  on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business manufacturing 
uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement 
in the united states  health care providers that purchase medical devices  such as the company s products  generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the medical device is being used 
in addition  certain health care providers are moving toward a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
managed care providers are attempting to control the cost of health care by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures 
the company is unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party health care payors 
furthermore  the company could be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private health care payors  particularly to the extent any such changes affect reimbursement for procedures in which the company s products are used 
failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors for procedures in which the company s products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the company obtains the necessary foreign regulatory approvals  market acceptance of the company s products in international markets would be dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
the company intends to seek international reimbursement approvals  although there can be no assurance that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of the company s products in the international markets in which such approvals are sought 
dependence on international sales 
in the future  the company expects to derive an increasing portion of its revenue from international sales 
to the extent that the company s international sales increase in future periods  a significant portion of the company s revenues could be subject to the risks associated with international sales  including economic or political instability  shipping delays  changes in applicable regulatory policies  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and various trade restrictions  all of which could have a significant impact on the company s ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
future imposition of  or significant increases in the level of  customs duties  import quotas or other trade restrictions could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the regulation of medical devices  particularly in the european economic community  continues to expand  and there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations will not have an adverse effect on the company 
dependence on key personnel 
innerdyne is dependent upon a limited number of key management and technical personnel 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the company will compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

product liability  claims in excess of insurance coverage 
the development  manufacture and sale of the company s products entail the risk of product liability claims  involving both potential financial exposure and associated adverse publicity 
the company s current product liability insurance coverage limits are  per occurrence and  in the aggregate  and there can be no assurance that such coverage limits are adequate to protect the company from any liabilities it might incur in connection with the development  manufacture and sale of its current and potential products 
product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if such insurance is available  there can be no assurance that the limits of coverage of such policies will be adequate 
a successful product liability claim in excess of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business product liability and insurance 
stock price volatility 
the stock market in general and stocks of medical device companies in particular  have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the market price of the company s common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
factors such as fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  fda and international regulatory actions  actions with respect to reimbursement matters  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products developed by the company or others  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding the company  other medical device companies or the medical device industry generally or general market conditions may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock

environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  manufacture and disposal of toxic and other hazardous substances used to manufacture the company s products 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable governmental environmental regulations 
nevertheless  the failure by the company to comply with current or future environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on the company  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with such regulations could require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject the company to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes 
the imposition of such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
control by directors and principal stockholders 
as of february   directors and principal stockholders of the company  and certain of their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these persons  as a group  may be able to control the company and significantly affect the direction of the company s affairs and business  including any determination with respect to the acquisition or disposition of assets by the company  future issuances of common stock or other securities by the company and the election of directors 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
anti takeover effect of certain charter provisions of common stock 
provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation that allow the company to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  the fact that the company s certificate of incorporation does not permit stockholders to cumulate votes in the election of directors as well as the company s adoption of a poison pill preferred share purchase rights plan in september may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of the company 
certain provisions of delaware law applicable to the company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving the company  including section  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock  the inability of stockholders to cumulate votes in the election of directors  the poison pill and provisions of delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  including without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock 
the possible issuance of preferred stock  the poison pill and these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
risks associated with software and hardware and the year innerdyne relies on a variety of internal computer systems and programs in the operation of its business 
the company is currently in the process of testing and upgrading  where necessary  the software and hardware products used in its operations with respect to the year issue 
the company s internal systems run on personal computers and microprocessor based computer servers set up in a workstation environment which the company believes are not susceptible to universal failures 
were system failures to occur as a result of the year issue  the company believes that its on site engineers and technical personnel should be able to address and resolve such issues prior to the occurrence of any material adverse effect on the company s business operations 
the failure of certain of the systems upon which the company relies  such as payroll and banking services  could be disruptive to the company s business operations if such systems were unavailable for an extended period of time 
the company is in the process of making inquiries with the providers of such types of services to determine their year readiness 
however  the company believes that its business operations would not be materially adversely effected by short disruptions in such services and that the providers of such services who also typically service many other business customers will take steps to rectify any failures as soon as possible 
more generally  the company does not believe that the power grid or general communications  building security and similar systems expose the company to any unique year risks as compared to other businesses 
the company faces year risk from third party suppliers 
notwithstanding written assurances from the company s vendors regarding year compliance  there is no guarantee that the year will not cause a disruption in the supply of critical components necessary for the company s products 
given the company s reliance on suppliers of critical  sole sourced components  the company is relying on these suppliers to address the year issues in their own products and operations  and the failure of such suppliers to adequately address these issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a contingency plan in the event that any of such suppliers do not or are unable to address material year issues  the company intends to stockpile an inventory of raw materials and molded parts in order to maintain a one month backlog of such components 
the company has not incurred substantial costs to date to address the year issue and estimates that the additional cost  if any  arising from actions taken by the company to address year problems will not be material 
despite the company s efforts to address the year impact on its internal systems and business operations  the year issue may result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations total revenues of  were realized during the year ended december   compared to total revenues of  in  and  in total revenues are comprised of revenues from product sales and licensing  contract and grant revenues 
revenues from product sales increased to  in from  in and  in  reflecting increased sales of the step device in each year 
licensing  contract and grant revenues were   and  in  and  respectively 
these revenues related to agreements with third parties covering the development of the company s proprietary thermal ablation technology  and licensing of the company s proprietary biocompatible coating and radial dilation technology 
licensing  contract and grant revenues will continue to fluctuate from year to year  and from quarter to quarter  based upon the number of agreements in effect and the amount and timing of the payments to be made to innerdyne pursuant to such agreements  and may depend on whether the company or the licensee can satisfy performance milestones 
total costs and expenses were  in compared to  in and  in expenses in  and grew because of increased costs of sales on higher sales volume  and included clinical  research and development and regulatory expenses related to the enabl system revas  and higher sales and marketing expenses related to the commercialization of the company s mis products  including step  one step  open step  and reposable step 
cost of sales was  in compared to  in  and  in cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct material costs of components for finished products  as well as labor costs and an allocated portion of overhead expenses 
the increase each year was due to the production of higher volumes of the step device 
although the company anticipates that cost of sales will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods  cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to decrease in if sales and production volumes increase 
research  development  regulatory and clinical expenses were  in compared to  in  and  in research  development  regulatory and clinical expenses are primarily comprised of salary and benefits  costs incurred in protecting the company s intellectual property and an allocated portion of overhead expenses 
the decrease in was the result of lower reimbursed research costs associated with the enabl thermal ablation system  while the increase in represented the additional development funding and clinical expenses related to the development of the one step and mini step  as well as vascular and arthroscopic access devices the company anticipates that research  development  regulatory and clinical expenditures are likely to increase in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses were  compared to  in  and  in sales and marketing expenses are primarily comprised of salary  benefits and commissions  an allocated portion of overhead expenses  advertising  promotional and customer service expenses  and cost of product samples 
the increase each year reflects the expansion of sales and marketing functions for mis products as sales volumes increased 
innerdyne expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses were  compared to  in  and  in general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salary and benefits  an allocated portion of overhead expenses  as well as legal  accounting  insurance and other general corporate expenses 
the decrease in expenses in related to negotiating lower insurance premiums  as well as lower professional services and consulting costs 
the increase in expenses in reflects additional staffing to support investor relations  financial functions  and professional services 
the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars to support expanding operations 
interest income was  in   in  and  in the decrease in was due to lower interest earned as the company s average cash and cash equivalent balances decreased 
interest expense was  in   in  and  in this increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in debt incurred to finance equipment to support operations of the company 
primarily for the reasons outlined above  innerdyne earned net income of  or 
per share on both a basic and diluted basis in and incurred net losses of  or 
per share on both a basic and diluted basis in  and  or 
per share on both a basic and diluted basis in liquidity and capital resources from its inception to december   the company has incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million 
prior to fiscal year  the company s cash expenditures exceeded its revenues 
prior to  the company was funded primarily through private placements of equity securities 
in  the company completed an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at per share  which raised approximately million net of underwriter s discounts and offering expenses 
the acquisition of innerdyne medical  inc was accomplished through the issuance of additional common stock of the company 
in june  the company closed a private placement of  shares of the company s common stock and warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock  with gross proceeds to the company of approximately million 
in march and april of  holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock exercised such warrants  resulting in gross proceeds to the company of  the company concluded a public offering on may   with the sale of  shares of common stock at per share  which raised  net of underwriter s discounts and offering expenses 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to  at december  the company had   and  in capital expenditures in the years ended december    and  respectively 
working capital totaled  at december   and the company had long term debt  excluding current installments  totaling  relating to financing of equipment 
in june  the company renewed its credit facility with silicon valley bank 
subject to certain covenants and conditions  the company may borrow up to  through june  on a revolving credit basis at prime plus 
based on eligible receivables 
the company also has an equipment advance line of credit  which allows the company to borrow up to  per year based on eligible equipment purchases 
amounts outstanding on this equipment advance line of credit are periodically converted to month term loans bearing interest at prime plus 
as of december   the company had drawn  for financing of working capital needs on the revolving line of credit  secured by certain accounts receivable  and had borrowed  for the financing of fixed assets with silicon valley bank 
debt balances as of december  on the company s balance sheet also include amounts loaned to the company under current and previous equipment lines of credit agreements with silicon valley bank 
in the future  the company may incur operating losses and cash outflow requirements as a result of expenditures related to expansion of sales and marketing capability  expansion of manufacturing capacity  research and development activities  compliance with regulatory requirements  and possible investment in  or acquisition of  additional complementary products  technologies or businesses 
the timing and amounts of these expenditures will depend upon many factors  such as the availability of capital  progress of the company s research and development  and factors that may be beyond the company s control  such as the results of product trials  the requirements for and the time required to obtain regulatory approval for existing products and any other products that may be developed or acquired  and market acceptance of the company s products 
the company s capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance and demand for its products  the resources the company devotes to the development  manufacture and marketing of its products  the progress of the company s clinical research and product development programs  the receipt of  and the time required to obtain  regulatory clearances and approvals  the resources required to protect the company s intellectual property  and other factors 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be accurately predicted 
funds may also be used for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to those of the company 
consequently  although the company believes that the proceeds of the public offering of shares of its common stock completed in may  together with revenues  credit facilities and other sources of liquidity  will provide adequate funding to meet its cash needs through at least  the company may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding or that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
any additional equity financings may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section 
interest rate risk as of december   innerdyne had short term investments of  substantially all of these short term investments consist of highly liquid money market funds and commercial paper investments with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of less than ninety days 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  rates would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  we do not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments 
innerdyne does not own any equity investments 
therefore  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
all innerdyne revenues are realized in us dollars  therefore  we do not believe that the company currently has any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
foreign currency risk international revenues were less than of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly through international distributors with payments to the company typically denominated in us dollars 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in was not material
