item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s utility operations are subject to regulation by the psc  which plays a significant role in determining the company s return on equity 
the psc approves rates that are intended to permit a specified rate of return on investment 
the company s rate tariffs allow the cost of gas to be passed through to customers see business regulatory matters 
the company s business is temperature sensitive 
accordingly  the company s operating results in any given period reflect  in addition to other factors  the impact of weather  with colder temperatures generally resulting in increased sales by the company 
the company anticipates that this sensitivity to seasonal and other weather conditions will continue to be so reflected in the company s operating results in future periods 
delta has filed in its general rate case see business regulatory matters a weather normalization tariff whereby it would be permitted to adjust rates for the billing months of november through march to reflect variations from normal weather 
delta has also proposed alternative regulatory tariffs that would provide for annual adjustments in the company s rates to reflect budgeted plans and to adjust to a target rate of return 
liquidity and capital resources because of the seasonal nature of delta s sales  the smallest proportion of cash generated from operations is received during the warmer months when sales volumes decrease considerably 
additionally  most construction activity takes place during the non heating season because of more favorable weather conditions 
during the warmer  non heating months  therefore  cash needs for operations and construction are partially met through short term borrowings 
capital expenditures for delta for fiscal are expected to be million 
delta generates internally only a portion of the cash necessary for its capital expenditure requirements and finances the balance of its capital expenditures on an interim basis through the use of its borrowing capability under its short term line of credit 
the current available line of credit is  of which  was borrowed at june  the line of credit  which is with bank one  kentucky  na  requires renewal during november  these short term borrowings are periodically repaid with the net proceeds from the sale of long term debt and equity securities  as was done in march   when the net proceeds of  from the sale of  of debentures were used to repay short term debt and to redeem the company s debentures  that would have matured in  in the amount of  the primary cash flows during the last three years are summarized below provided by operating activities used in investing activities    provided by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    cash provided by operating activities consists of net income and noncash items including depreciation  depletion  amortization and deferred income taxes 
additionally  changes in working capital are also included in cash provided by operating activities 
the company expects that internally generated cash  coupled with short term borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy its operating  normal capital expenditure and dividend requirements 
results of operations operating revenues the decrease in operating revenues of  for was due primarily to decreases in the cost of gas purchased that were reflected in rates billed to customers through delta s gas cost recovery clause and to decreases in sales volumes 
mcf sales decreased  mcf  or  as compared to  resulting from warmer winter weather in heating degree days billed were of normal in  compared with in the increase in operating revenues of  for was due primarily to the general rate increase effective november  and to the increases in on system and off system transportation volumes of  mcf and  mcf  respectively 
the increase in operating revenues includes  of additional revenue caused by a non recurring change 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in retail sales volumes of  mcf as a result of the warmer winter weather in billed degree days were of normal for as compared with for operating expenses the decrease in purchased gas expense for of  was due primarily to the decreases in the cost of gas purchased for retail sales and from decreased gas purchases for retail sales resulting from the warmer winter weather in the decrease in purchased gas expense for of  was due primarily to the decreased gas purchases for retail sales resulting from the warmer winter weather in the increases in depreciation expense during and of  and  respectively  were due primarily to additional depreciable plant 
the increases in taxes other than income taxes during and of  and  respectively  were primarily due to increased property taxes which resulted from increased plant and property valuations  and to increased payroll taxes  which resulted from increased wages 
changes in income taxes during and of  and  respectively  were primarily due to changes in net income 
interest charges the increases in interest on long term debt during and of  and  respectively  were due primarily to the issuance of million of debentures in march  the decrease in other interest during of  was due primarily to decreased average short term debt borrowings 
the increase in other interest during of  was due primarily to increased average short term debt borrowings 
basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended june  and  basic earnings per common share declined  as compared with previous periods  as a result of lower net income and the increased average common shares outstanding that resulted from the common shares issued under delta s dividend reinvestment plan and shares issued to employees during the periods 
other than delta s outstanding common shares  there are no potentially dilutive securities 
therefore  basic and diluted earnings per common share are the same

the year issue the company is working to determine the potential impact of the year on the ability of delta s computerized information systems to accurately process information that may be date sensitive 
any of delta s programs that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year could result in errors or system failures 
the company uses a number of computer programs across its entire operation 
in recent years  delta has replaced virtually all of its financial computer systems both hardware and software with systems from third party vendors who certify their products as being year compliant 
the company has established a year committee  comprised of members of management  which has coordinated an extensive inventory of all operational systems  including information technology it hardware and software  as well as non it embedded systems such as process controls for gas delivery and metering systems and service providers 
the committee is assessing the likelihood of miscalculations or system failures as a result of these items  systems or service providers 
the company has currently assessed and deems compliant approximately of these inventoried items  systems and service providers 
this assessment and compliance percentage for the items delta deems as critical stands at 
the company intends to complete all year remediation and testing activities by september  the costs incurred to date related to its year activities have not been material to the company  and based upon current estimates  the company does not believe that the total cost of its year readiness programs will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial position

delta understands that even though it is taking steps to prepare it could  nevertheless  be adversely affected by the failures and or delays caused by any non compliant equipment used by its suppliers or vendors 
therefore  delta is currently gathering information regarding the steps its mission critical suppliers and vendors are taking to become year compliant 
for instance  delta has sent each of these parties a letter inquiring about the nature and extent of their efforts 
although the company has initiated year communications with significant customers  key vendors  service suppliers and other parties material to the company s operations  such third parties nonetheless represent a risk that cannot be assessed with precision or controlled with certainty 
the major risks to the company if implementation of the year compliance program is not successful are the gas delivery  metering and billing systems 
potential problems related to these systems include service interruptions to customers  interrupted revenue data gathering and poor customer relations resulting from delayed billing 
the company has prepared contingency plans to address alternatives in the event that year failures of automatic systems and equipment occur 
these plans cover a wide range of possible scenarios and include steps to remediation 
also  included in the contingency plans are mitigating actions designed to lessen the chances of problem scenarios being realized
