implementation of change in accounting estimate effective january   the company implemented prospectively a change in accounting estimate whereby capital expenditures for carpet  appliances  and heating  ventilation  and air conditioning hvac replacements are capitalized rather than expensed 
the company believes that capitalizing these expenditures and depreciating them over lives ranging from three to five years more appropriately reflects the timing of the economic benefits to be received from these expenditures 
additionally  the company believes this treatment is consistent with policies currently being used by a majority of other reits 
however  comparability of ffo between reits is affected by the method of accounting for these items

for the years ended december  and  capitalized expenditures for these items resulting from the change in accounting estimate were as follows dollars in thousands carpet appliances hvac allowance for estimated losses and provisions for losses the company s management periodically evaluates the carrying values of the company s properties held for sale 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the carrying value of a property held for sale not exceed the lower of its cost or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell 
in those instances in which estimates of fair value less estimated selling costs are less than the carrying values thereof at the time of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued allowance for estimated losses and provisions for losses continued evaluation  an allowance for loss is provided by a charge against operations 
the evaluation generally includes selective site inspections  a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  a review of the property s expenses  a review of maintenance requirements  discussions with the manager of the property  and a review of the surrounding area 
future evaluations could cause the company s management to adjust current estimates of fair value 
the company s management also evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of the company s properties held for investment may not be recoverable 
this evaluation generally consists of a review of the property s cash flow and current and projected market conditions  as well as any changes in general and local economic conditions 
if an impairment loss exists based on the results of this evaluation  a loss is recognized by a charge against current earnings and a corresponding reduction in the respective asset s carrying value 
the amount of this impairment loss is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value 
environmental matters under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  the company may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other potential costs including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property relating to hazardous or toxic substances where property level managers have arranged for the removal  disposal  or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may seek recovery from the company for personal injury associated with such materials 
the company s management is not aware of any environmental liability relating to the above matters that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  or results of operations 
tax matters for the years ended december    and  the company elected  and in the opinion of the company s management qualified  to be taxed as a reit  as defined under sections through of the internal revenue code of a reit is required to distribute at least of its reit taxable income plus of its net income from foreclosure property  as defined in section of the internal revenue code  on an annual basis to shareholders 
impact of year issues the year issue is the result of electronic devices storing the applicable year as a two digit field rather than four 
consequently  any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  process invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
following is a discussion of the status of the company s assessment of its exposure to year issues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of year issues continued state of readiness with regard to the company s information technology systems  certain computer equipment and software were found not to be year compliant 
the company has begun to replace the computer equipment with year compliant equipment and to upgrade the software to year compliant versions 
these upgrades were planned regardless of year issues  but they were accelerated in order to ensure compliance 
these upgrades are on schedule to be completed by july with regard to embedded technology issues  such as with elevators in commercial buildings  sprinkler systems  security gates  and security alarms  the company is currently assessing the potential risks 
the company believes that such risks will not materially affect the company s business 
the company is completing assessment of its external property management companies state of readiness and is actively involved with their year readiness programs to ensure the business impact is minimal to non existent 
the company is currently assessing potential risks related to third parties  including utility companies  banks  and phone companies 
the company believes there is minimal risk that these third parties will not be year compliant 
costs to address year issues to date  the company has expended approximately  for replacing noncompliant hardware and approximately  for purchasing upgraded accounting software 
the bulk of these costs represent the company s allocation of expenditures incurred by tra prior to the company s acquisition of tra 
the company is also upgrading the accounting management software at its properties 
this upgraded property software is being provided free of charge by the software manufacturer 
expected remaining costs are  for software conversion  including consulting fees  and  for additional hardware 
risks of year issues potential material risks related to the year include the following 
if the company s computer systems and software are not successfully upgraded prior to  the ability of the company to provided timely financial information may be impaired 
however  the company is confident that these upgrades will be completed in a timely manner 
similarly  the company s ability to provide financial information could be adversely affected if computer systems of banks with which the company does business do not become year compliant 
also  if the computer systems of utility companies which provide services to the company do not become year compliant  tenants of the company s properties could be inconvenienced or even harmed 
however  the company believes it is unlikely that these banks and utility companies will not become year compliant 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impact of year issues continued contingency plans the company has not fully completed contingency plans 
however  one focus of the plans will be to source alternate third party vendors that are likely to successfully become year compliant 
the company anticipates having the contingency plans in place by mid year risks associated with forward looking statements included in this form k this form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
these statements include the plans and objectives of management for future operations  including plans and objectives relating to capital expenditures on the company s properties 
the forward looking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic  competitive  and market conditions and future business decisions  all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included in this form k will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  the company manages exposures through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million of variable rate debt 
based upon this balance of variable rate debt  if the indexes upon which these rates are based  primarily the day london interbank offered rate libor  increased basis points  the company s earnings and cash flows would decrease by  conversely  if interest rates decreased by basis points  the company s earnings and cash flows would increase by  the estimated fair value of the company s variable rate debt at december   is million 
see note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the methodology used by the company in calculating fair values of notes payable 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the company s variable rate debt  and a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million increase in the fair value of the company s variable rate debt 
the company has entered into reverse repurchase agreements with an investment bank for three mortgage backed securities mbss secured separately by mortgages on three of the company s properties 
see note notes  debentures  and interest payable in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the reverse repurchase agreements 
increases in market interest rates generally cause decreases in the value of the mbss  requiring the company to deposit additional funds with the investment bank assuming no change in the investment bank s margin requirements 
decreases in market interest rates generally cause increases in the value of the mbss  resulting in the release of margin funds to the company by the investment bank assuming no change in the investment bank s margin requirements 
additionally  the repurchase price bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a decrease of  in the company s earnings and a decrease of million in the company s cash flow 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of  in the company s earnings and an increase of million in the company s cash flow
