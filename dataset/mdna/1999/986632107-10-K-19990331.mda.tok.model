item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
general the company is the second largest casket manufacturer in the united states and produces a wide variety of caskets  casket components and burial vaults 
during  the company acquired colonial guild  ltd 
thus becoming a major manufacturer of commemorative products 
the company s finished caskets are marketed through a network of company and privately owned distributors  which serve domestic funeral homes  as well as certain foreign markets 
burial vaults are sold directly to funeral home and cemetery operators as well as to privately owned distributors 
the company s commemorative memorial products are sold directly to cemetery operators  monument dealers and funeral homes  and its architectural signage products are sold primarily to sign and trophy dealers 
in certain markets  the company believes that its privately owned casket distributors will continue to be the most effective way to market the company s casket products and expects to continue to strongly support the efforts of these privately owned distributors 
however  the company has  and will continue to  acquire certain of its distributors if the company believes that such acquisitions would be complementary and result in operating efficiencies 
the company owns distribution operations serving new england  southern  northern california  pacific northwest and certain midwest markets 
funeral homes are required by federal regulation to provide price lists to their customers  and generally publish such price lists annually 
as a result  the casket manufacturing industry has established the industry wide practice of setting its prices every january 
the memorialization business also establishes prices annually  generally during the first calendar quarter 
in setting these prices  the company considers expected raw material prices  competitive considerations  the general state of the economy and inflationary expectations 
this industry practice requires the company to set its prices in anticipation of  rather than in response to  changes in raw material and other costs 
over the past three years  the company s annual weighted average price increases have ranged from to 
limitations on the timing of price increases relative to changes in costs may cause fluctuations in operating margins  and therefore  make quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
the major domestic casket manufacturers have all developed discount and rebate programs  which are commonplace in the casket manufacturing industry  designed to encourage volume purchases by funeral homes 
in the case of the company  these discounts are generally absorbed equally between the company and the distributors

the year issue the company has assessed how it may be impacted by year issues and has formulated and commenced implementation of a plan to address both its information technology it and non it systems issues 
this plan involves a combination of hardware and software modifications  upgrades and replacements  including implementation of a new software package which will not only address the year issues but provide additional business process functionality in the future 
the company is approximately complete with its modifications  upgrades and replacements 
the company currently expects testing of the elements of its plan to be completed by july   and plan implementation with respect to all significant operations completed by august  the company has surveyed its suppliers and reviewed its customers to identify and resolve any year issues that may arise with such customers and suppliers  but the company currently does not believe that any such issues will have a material effect on its operations or financial results

approximately of the remaining expenditures are expected to be capitalized 
the company is in the process of establishing a worst case scenario and written contingency plans to address any issues that could arise should the company or any of its suppliers or customers not be prepared to accommodate year issues timely 
the company believes that in an emergency it could revert to the use of manual systems that do not rely on computers and could perform the minimum functions required to provide information reporting to maintain satisfactory control of its business 
should the company have to utilize manual systems  it is uncertain that it could maintain the same level of operations  and the result could have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial results 
the company intends to maintain constant surveillance on this situation and develop more practicable contingency plans as may be required by the changing environment 
inflation inflation has not had a material net impact on the company over the past three years nor is it anticipated to have a material impact for the foreseeable future 
selected quarterly operating results and seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced seasonal variations 
generally  the company s net sales of caskets are highest in the first quarter and lowest in the third quarter of each year 
these fluctuations are due in part to the seasonal variance in the death rate  with a greater number of deaths generally occurring in cold weather months  and the timing of the company s annual manufacturing facility vacation shutdowns  which occur primarily in the third quarter 
the company s memorialization sales seasonally lag the company s casket business  and are highest in the second quarter  coinciding with the memorial day holiday  and lowest in the first quarter 
in addition  casket and memorialization products operating results can vary between quarters of the same or different years due to  among other things  fluctuations in the number of deaths  changes in product mix  and the timing of annual price increases relative to changes in costs 
as a result  the company experiences variability in its operating results on a quarterly basis  which may make quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful
