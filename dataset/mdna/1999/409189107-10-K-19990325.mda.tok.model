management anticipates such expenditures will be financed from operations

in  the company entered into two joint ventures in central america for the purpose of producing apparel under the caribbean basin incentive program or as imports 
effective december   the company purchased the ownership interest of its joint venture partner in one of the ventures for  this entity has been consolidated since the date of acquisition 
this transaction resulted in recording goodwill of  which is being amortized over years 
the company continues to maintain a interest in the other joint venture 
year issues the company has been in the process of assessing the various issues related to the year for the past two years 
as a result of its initial studies  in management decided to convert all information systems to new computer hardware and software 
all new hardware and software have been certified by the appropriate vendors as being year compliant 
to date  the financial systems  accounts payable  accounts receivable  payroll and human resources have been completed 
also  the company s internal network of lan s  wan s and other communication systems have been converted to year compliant systems 
the systems that maintain and manage customer orders  inventory and production are critical to the company s success 
in the fall of  systems were identified and purchased that would meet the company s requirements and be year compliant 
in the first quarter of testing began on these new systems 
all significant functions have been successfully tested 
starting in the third quarter of and continuing into the fourth quarter  the process of converting data onto the new systems began 
during late november and december  a complete parallel of the new systems was begun to insure that all critical functions are addressed 
it is expected that on march  the conversion process will be completed and all information systems will have been successfully installed 
over this time period approximately  has been spent on hardware systems  which includes computer hardware  infared scanners  printers and telephone systems 
expenditures for software has approximated  the personnel cost related to the design and implementation of the systems is approximately  and has been included in fixed assets 
non information technology systems  which include items such as burglar and fire alarms  copiers  elevators and various sewing equipment are being addressed by an internal team and it is expected that all of these systems will be year compliant by end of the second quarter of this project is approximately complete 
no major expenditures are anticipated for these areas 
the company is also reviewing its external relationships to address potential year impacts arising from interfaces with customers  suppliers and service providers 
the company is currently communicating with its significant suppliers and key customers to assess their ability to meet their sales and purchasing obligations despite the year issue  and will continue to monitor this into the year by the end of the second quarter of  the company will have verified that all significant suppliers which will have company production in process at the end of  will be year compliant 
this process is approximately complete 
the company sells to approximately  customers 
forty of these customers account for approximately of the total sales 
these customers represent the largest retailers in the united states 
a majority of these customers maintain a trading partnership with the company through edi transactions 
as a result  the company has continuous dialogue with these customers in order to determine whether they will be year compliant 
surveys are being sent to the remaining customers to attempt to determine the extent of their compliance with year issues 
risk associated with this group of customers would be excess bad debts or lower sales volume if they cease operations and no single customer would have a material adverse affect on the company if it ceased operations 
however  if a large group of these customers ceased operations the company would be negatively impacted 
management is unable to quantify this risk at this time 
for the company imported approximately of its total product and was manufactured in the caribbean area 
these areas are critical to the company s success 
both sources of product require that the product is shipped on the ocean  then clear us customs and then utilize domestic transportation systems 
should the year problem significantly affect either the us customs or transportation systems  disruption of receiving product would occur which would result in material adverse affect on the operating results or financial condition 
it is not feasible for the company to assess the ability of these entities to be year compliant 
while there can be no absolute assurance that the company will successfully address all year issues in a timely basis  it is anticipated that the company will have all of its systems in compliance by the end of the second quarter of management does not plan to develop contingency plans that relate to key systems 
contingency plans will be developed in the event that the company determines that it is at risk with suppliers  customers or manufacturing systems 
contingency plans will include  but will not be limited to consideration of alternative sources of supply  customer communication plans  plant and business response plans 
the company believes the year project will be completed prior to the year however  considerable work remains to be accomplished in a limited period of time and unforeseen difficulties may arise which could adversely affect the company s ability to complete its systems modifications correctly  completely  on time and or within its cost estimate 
in addition  there can be no assurance that customers  suppliers and service providers on which the company relies will resolve their year issues accurately  thoroughly and on time 
failure to complete the year project by the year could have a material adverse affect on future operating results and financial condition 
impact of inflation general inflation in the economy has increased operating expenses of most businesses 
the company has provided compensation increases generally in line with the inflation rate and incurred higher prices for materials  goods and services 
the company continually seeks methods of reducing cost and streamlining operations while maximizing efficiency through improved internal operating procedures and controls 
while the company is subject to inflation as described above  management believes that inflation currently does not have a material effect on the company s operating results  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to be so in the future
