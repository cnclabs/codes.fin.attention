the following discussion of results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of keebler foods company and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere 
overview general we sell cookies and crackers  custom baked products to other manufacturers of branded food products  pie crusts and ice cream cones 
our net sales are principally affected by product pricing and quality  brand recognition  new product introductions  product line extensions  marketing and service 
we manage these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring our higher margin products while driving volume through our national dsd distribution system 
the principal elements comprising our cost of sales are raw and packaging materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the major raw materials that we use in the manufacture of our products are flour  sugar  chocolate  shortening and milk 
we also use paper products  such as corrugated cardboard  as well as films and plastics to package our products 
the prices of these raw materials have been subject to significant volatility 
we have mitigated the effect of such volatility in the past through our hedging programs  but may not be successful in protecting our business from price increases in the future 
in addition to the foregoing factors  our cost of sales are affected by the efficiency of production methods and manufacturing capacity utilization 
our selling  marketing and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of labor and lease costs associated with our national dsd distribution system  trade and consumer promotion costs  other advertising costs and the cost of our corporate offices 
while costs associated with our national dsd distribution system and the cost of our corporate offices are generally fixed  promotion and other advertising costs are more variable 
promotion and other advertising costs represent the largest component of our cost structure other than cost of sales and are principally influenced by changes in net sales 
we are in the process of integrating president into our operations 
in connection with this integration  we are currently undertaking a complete analysis of our system wide manufacturing and distribution operations as we assess opportunities to improve our operational efficiencies in and beyond 
we currently anticipate that we will take a restructuring charge during when our analysis and related plans are finalized 
matters affecting comparability keebler s fiscal year consists of thirteen four week periods fifty two or fifty three weeks and ends on the saturday nearest december the fiscal year consists of fifty two weeks and the fiscal year consists of fifty three weeks 
as a result of the keebler acquisition  which closed on the last day of the first four week period of  the fiscal year for consisted of the forty eight weeks ended december  keebler s operating results for the forty eight weeks ended december  have been combined with the operating results of the predecessor company for the four weeks ended january  to compare the year ended december  to the years ended january  and january  keebler s operating results for the year ended january  include the operating results of president from the acquisition date of september  keebler s operating results for the year ended december  include the operating results of sunshine from the acquisition date of june   whereas the subsequent years include the operating results of sunshine for the entire year 
additionally  keebler s operating results have been restated to reflect the merger with inflo as if it had been effective january  results of operations keebler s results of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales  for the last three years ended january   january  and december  are set forth below years ended january  january  december  net sales cost of sales selling  marketing and administrative expenses income from continuing operations interest expense  net loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of tax net income keebler s reportable segments are branded and specialty  which were determined using keebler s method of internal reporting  which divides and analyzes the business by sales channel 
the reportable segments represent an aggregation of similar sales channels 
we evaluate the performance of the reportable segments and allocate resources based on the segment s profit contribution  defined as earnings before certain functional support costs  amortization  interest and income taxes 
while the accounting policies for each reportable segment are the same as for the total company  the cost of sales used to determine a segment s profit contribution is calculated using standard costs for each product  whereas actual cost of sales is used to determine consolidated operating income loss 
branded segment the branded segment sells a number of well recognized products  primarily to retail outlets such as supermarkets  mass merchandisers  warehouse club stores  convenience stores and drug stores 
this segment also imports and distributes carr s crackers in the us under an exclusive long term licensing and distribution agreement with united biscuits 
years ended january  january  december  in millions net sales    profit contribution net sales in the branded segment increased in to  million 
the acquisition of president contributed million in incremental revenue 
adjusting to an equal number of selling days and before including the acquisition growth  branded revenues grew over the prior year 
the primary drivers of the increase were higher sales of products under both the keebler and cheez it brands 
the keebler brand name was used to leverage new product introductions through line extensions such as the keebler peanut butter fudge sticks 
the growth in cheez it sales was partly attributed to new products such as cheez it heads and tails  cheez it sandwich crackers and cheez it snack mix 
additionally  we redirected marketing support into brand building advertising and consumer promotions 
for example  with this support  sales of keebler fudge shoppe cookies and cheez it products grew in  with cheez it products increasing over a favorable sales mix of keebler branded products  combined with selected price increases  also generated higher revenues 
further contributing to the improvement was continued revenue growth outside supermarkets  such as in mass merchandisers  convenience and club stores 
net sales in were higher compared to revenue growth in was achieved by incremental sales associated with the sunshine acquisition as well as increased volumes 
in  sales of sunshine products by the branded segment were approximately million from the acquisition date until year end compared to approximately million for all of successful new product introductions and growth in the retail businesses outside supermarkets also propelled increased volume 
the branded segment had a profit contribution of million or of net sales 
after removing the impact of president  profit contribution was of net sales  which represented a percentage point increase over a higher gross profit and lower distribution expenses drove the improvement 
the benefit noted in gross profit was attributed to improved sales mix  selected price increases and continued productivity gains in our bakeries 
lower distribution expenses were due to more fully utilizing available trailer capacity and productivity and cost savings programs designed to minimize inventory losses 
the profit contribution of million was of net sales compared to the profit contribution of of net sales 
a higher gross profit was also the main contributor to the percentage point improvement in the profit contribution 
after discontinuing several less profitable products in  the sales mix consisted of higher margin products 
additionally  the profit contribution reflected lower prices on certain raw materials and lower production costs due to the implementation of several productivity programs in our manufacturing facilities 
selling and distribution expenses also decreased as a percent of net sales due to increased volume coupled with the benefit of cost reduction initiatives 
somewhat offsetting these improvements were higher marketing expenses primarily spent on brand building  national advertising 
specialty segment the specialty segment produces cookies and crackers for the foodservice market  the girl scouts of america and private label retailers 
in addition  we also produce custom baked products for other marketers of branded food products 
years ended january  january  december  in millions net sales profit contribution net revenues in the specialty segment in were flat compared to the acquisition of president contributed million of incremental sales 
adjusting to an equal number of selling days and before including the acquisition growth  net sales in the specialty segment were million  or  below net sales in were also flat compared to while an improved sales mix benefited each year  the overall decrease in net sales for each year on year comparison was principally associated with lower margin products that were either discontinued or re positioned at higher price levels 
volume declines in custom baked products in also served to offset gains received from selected price increases 
the specialty segment s profit contribution of million was percentage point above the prior year  as a percent of net sales 
before considering the impact of president  profit contribution was of net sales in compared to in the improvement in profit contribution was primarily achieved by a more profitable sales mix  selected price increases and productivity gains received through bakery automation projects and supply chain initiatives in distribution and inventory management 
profit contribution was million in which resulted in a percentage point increase in profit contribution over that was principally driven by a more favorable sales mix in coupled with growth in sales of private label products 
lower raw material costs in also contributed to the profit contribution improvement 
cost of sales cost of sales was million in which included an additional million related to cost of sales for president that was not included in prior years 
excluding the impact of president  cost of sales  as a percent of net sales  was for compared to in and in the improvements made in each year were principally achieved from initiatives implemented to increase automation and productivity at our manufacturing facilities along with other cost reduction programs 
the streamlining of our manufacturing facilities  creating increased capacity utilization  also contributed to a lower cost of sales 
additionally  the cost of certain raw and packaging materials has declined from previous years 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million higher compared to  however  percentage points better as a percent of net sales 
after removing million of additional expense attributable to president  selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million above the prior year 
higher marketing expenses related to our continued focus on building brand equity through advertising and consumer promotions was the primary driver of the increased spending 
partially offsetting these higher marketing expenses were savings achieved in distribution costs due to improved inventory handling and deployment 
in  selling  marketing and administrative spending increased million compared to  yet remained consistent as a percentage of net sales 
increased spending was driven by higher volume captured through both internal growth and the sunshine acquisition 
in  we began spending more on advertising and other consumer promotions to create increased brand and consumer awareness 
selling  marketing and administrative expenses remained comparable as a percent of net sales in and due to higher volumes passing through a more efficient  fixed cost  selling and distribution network 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the steady decline was primarily due to both a continuing overall lower average debt balance and more favorable interest rates 
interest expense declined from  despite the million of additional debt incurred from the acquisition of president  due to lower interest rates  fees and favorable terms 
in conjunction with the president acquisition  the million outstanding balance on the term note was extinguished  also contributing to the reduction in interest expense 
the decrease in the average debt balance from was the result of principal pre payments of million on the term loans and a million pre payment of the seller note 
in addition  the weighted average interest rate was percentage points lower than the previous year while the weighted average rate was percentage points lower than income taxes income taxes were provided at an effective tax rate of in  in and in in each year  the effective tax rate exceeded the statutory rate due to nondeductible expenses  principally amortization of intangibles  including trademarks  trade names  other intangibles and goodwill 
the percentage point increase in the effective tax rate from to was due primarily to the increase in nondeductible expenses  principally the amortization of intangibles  resulting from the president acquisition 
the effective tax rate declined in  compared to  as earnings were significantly higher in  thereby reducing the impact of nondeductible expenses  such as amortization of intangibles  on the calculation of the effective tax rate 
income tax expense was not provided for during the first four weeks of as part of the keebler acquisition  the valuation allowance on deferred taxes was adjusted by million to reflect the elimination of certain deferred tax assets revalued in the purchase price allocation 
we carried a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at january   january  and december  to provide for the uncertainty in realizing the deductibility of deferred tax assets recognized 
pursuant to the terms of the keebler acquisition  the predecessor company retained the right to use the net operating losses for potential carrybacks 
any unused operating losses are then available to us  but are significantly restricted under current tax law 
therefore  all net operating loss carryforwards have been fully reserved due to the uncertainty of their realization 
discontinued operations in  the predecessor company adopted plans to discontinue the operations of the frozen food businesses  and in the first four weeks of  a gain of million  net of income taxes  was recognized on the disposal of the frozen food businesses 
extraordinary item net of income taxes in the latter part of  an after tax extraordinary charge of million was recorded for the write off of unamortized bank fees related to the early extinguishment of the term note 
similarly  in and  we also recorded extraordinary charges  net of income taxes  of million and million  respectively 
in  million of the extraordinary charges  net of tax  also related to the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the early retirement of term loans 
an additional million  net of income taxes  extraordinary charge was recorded due to a loss on the early extinguishment of the seller note which was entered into at the time of the keebler acquisition 
the extraordinary charge of million  net of income taxes  related to the write off of debt issuance costs made in connection with the million early extinguishment of increasing rate notes 
net income in  net income of million was higher than the prior year and net income of million for was million above the substantial growth in net earnings in year over year comparisons was achieved through revenue gains combined with lower operating expenses resulting from productivity and cost savings programs 
revenue growth in both and was achieved through volume increases  higher prices and an improved sales mix 
compared to  also benefited from increased revenue due to the inclusion of the sunshine business for the entire fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources a condensed cash flow statement of keebler follows years ended january  january  december  in millions cash provided from used by operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flow for operating activities provided million of cash during net earnings of million coupled with the deferral of additional income taxes were the primary drivers of the favorable cash flow 
partially offsetting these sources of cash was an increased investment in inventories and trade accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
a build in finished goods  principally associated with the upcoming girl scout cookie season  accounted for the larger investment in inventory 
the increase in trade accounts receivable was due principally to the addition of the president s trade accounts receivable subsequent to the acquisition 
also offsetting these cash sources was million of current year net spending for plant and facility closing costs and severance related to the exit costs associated with the keebler  sunshine and president acquisitions 
spending on plant and facility closing costs and severance is expected to be substantially completed by the end of  except for noncancelable lease obligations which are expected to continue until higher income tax payments attributable to a million increase in pre tax income over the prior year also offset the positive cash flow 
cash used by investing activities was million  of which million  net of cash acquired  was attributable to the acquisition of president in september an additional million of capital spending was made for modifications related to new products  to update and enhance production facilities and to achieve near term cost savings and efficiencies in the manufacturing  sales and distribution process 
at year end  we held the idle atlanta  georgia manufacturing facility  a distribution center in kensington  connecticut and a warehouse in houston  texas for sale and expect the disposition of these facilities to be completed before the end of financing activities generated million of cash for the year principally from proceeds of long term debt borrowings under million of available new debt facilities used to finance the acquisition of president 
we also received million of cash proceeds resulting from bermore exercising a warrant in exchange for  shares of common stock at the time of our initial public offering 
employee stock options exercised during the year provided another million of cash 
these cash sources were partially offset by the pre payment of the million outstanding term note balance and a million repayment on the revolving facility 
in addition  cash totaling million was used to repurchase common stock into treasury under the stock repurchase program 
cash flow for and cash provided from operating activities was million in which was an increase of million over the cash provided from operations in the primary contributors to the positive cash flow for were net earnings of million  a lower investment in trade accounts receivable and reduced funding of current liabilities and income taxes 
improved accounts receivable collection procedures provided million of working capital 
the reduced funding of current liabilities was attributable primarily to the timing of payments  while the increase in income taxes payable was attributable to a million increase in earnings over partially offsetting these benefits was spending on plant and facility closing costs and severance and the payment of an arbitration award 
spending on plant and facility closing costs and severance relating to exit costs associated with the keebler and sunshine acquisitions  although down from  accounted for million of cash used by operations for the year ended january  exit cost spending associated with these acquisitions was substantially complete at the end of  with the exception of noncancelable lease obligations  which are expected to continue until in addition  we paid an arbitration award in regarding a contract production arrangement  which was entered into by the predecessor company  in the amount of million plus legal fees 
cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million in the cash used in was primarily used to fund capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
in  capital spending was made principally to enhance  update or realign the existing production lines  provide distribution and production efficiencies and to achieve near term cost savings 
proceeds received from asset disposals of million partially offset capital expenditures 
the sale of the santa fe springs plant in accounted for million of the proceeds  with the remainder provided mainly from the sale of trucks and machinery and equipment 
cash used by financing activities in was million 
in  we entered into an amendment and restatement of our prior senior credit agreement  proceeds from which were used to extinguish existing term loans of million 
the extinguishment was funded primarily by a draw down on the revolving loan facility and million under a new term loan 
during  the draw down on the revolving loan facility was completely repaid 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we extinguished million of debt related to the seller note and made million in principal pre payments on the term loan using existing cash resources 
scheduled principal payments of million were made on the term loan and other debt during the year 
capital resources in and  our capital resources were provided under two separate credit arrangements 
in order to consummate the acquisition of president in september  we entered into a new credit facility consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term facility 
in addition  we also entered into a million bridge facility that was subsequently refinanced with a receivables facility on january  these new debt facilities replaced the available million revolving loan facility and an existing term loan which were outstanding in and until the time of the president acquisition 
available borrowings under the revolving facility and the previous revolving loan facility were million and million in and  respectively 
borrowings under the million revolving facility in were million  with million repaid as of january  there were no borrowings under the million revolving loan facility in  however  there were million of borrowings in  which was all repaid as of january  capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  up nearly million from the majority of capital spending in will be used to increase the automation in production and distribution facilities in order to obtain additional productivity and cost savings 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will be funded from cash provided by operations and will continue at a level sufficient to support our strategies and operating needs 
historically  we have not paid dividends  and at this time do not anticipate paying any cash dividends 
the existing credit facility and notes place limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on our common stock 
additionally  the credit facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants including a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio and cash flow coverage ratios 
in addition to these ratios  the credit agreement also requires us to meet net worth and interest coverage ratios 
in and  we met all financial covenants in each of our financing agreements 
total debt was million  million and million as of january   january  and december   respectively 
current maturities on the total debt outstanding were million  million and million as of such respective dates 
cash and cash equivalents on january   january  and december  were million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that available cash  as well as amounts available under our new debt facilities  will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the new statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and that the instruments be measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
we have not yet determined the impact the new statement may have on the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our net sales  net income and cash flow are affected by the timing of new product introductions  promotional activities  price increases and a seasonal bias toward the second half of the year due to events such as back to school  thanksgiving and christmas 
the relative mix between cookie and cracker sales varies throughout the year with stronger cracker sales in the last quarter of the calendar year 
president s net sales  net income and cash flow historically has been higher in the first quarter than in any other fiscal quarter because substantially all sales of girl scout cookies have occurred in that quarter 
for this reason  going forward  we expect to realize proportionately higher net sales  net income and cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year than we historically have experienced 
self insurance we purchase insurance coverage for worker s compensation as well as general  product and vehicle liability maintaining certain levels of retained risk self insured portion 
potential losses relating to claims under the self insured portion of the policies are accrued in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
there are no unasserted claims that require a reserve or disclosure in accordance with sfas no 
year issue the year issue arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
as a result  computer programs may not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many businesses are at risk for possible computer application miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in business operations 
these risks are commonly referred to as the yk issues 
we utilize software and related technologies that will be affected by the date change in the year we have completed a comprehensive review of our computer systems and non information technology systems to identify potential yk issues 
since we have implemented the sap r management information system and manugistics software  both of which were developed purchased as yk compliant  we do not anticipate that the impact of yk issues on our business will be material 
additionally  secondary information systems  which are not material to our ability to forecast  manufacture or deliver product  have been reviewed and yk issues identified 
we are currently in the process of correcting or upgrading these systems 
we intend to be yk compliant on all critical systems by the middle of we have undertaken efforts to verify that all of our material vendors and suppliers will be yk compliant 
specifically  we sent a comprehensive questionnaire to all of our significant suppliers and vendors regarding their yk compliance in an attempt to identify any problem areas with respect to these groups 
although the results of the questionnaire indicated that our material vendors and suppliers intend to be yk compliant before the end of  they were not able to provide us any assurances 
we are currently in the process of developing a contingency plan to address any potential yk failures caused by a third party 
while we cannot assure that third parties will convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way compatible with our systems  we believe that our actions with third parties detailed above  along with the development of a contingency plan  will minimize these risks 
we currently estimate that the incremental costs for becoming yk compliant are approximately million  which will be funded from cash provided by operations and expensed as incurred 
spending of million against this estimate has occurred to date 
this estimate is exclusive of yk issues regarding the president acquisition 
we have completed a comprehensive review of president s computer systems and non information technology systems to identify potential yk issues 
many of the yk risks at president will be mitigated through our implementation of the sap r management information system  manugistics software and our warehouse management system at the president facilities 
we expect this implementation to be completed during we estimate additional costs of approximately million will be necessary to correct or upgrade president s secondary information systems in order to make them yk compliant 
based on the progress we have made in addressing our yk issues and our compliance with yk issues on our primary business information systems  we do not foresee significant risks associated with our yk compliance at this time 
as our plan is to address any significant risks associated with our yk issues prior to being affected by them  a comprehensive contingency plan has not been developed 
however  if a significant risk related to our yk compliance or a delay in the anticipated timeline for compliance occurs  we will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time 
the information presented above sets forth the steps we have taken to address the yk issues 
we do not expect compliance with yk issues or the most reasonably likely worst case scenario and related contingency plan to have a material impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the above discussion of our efforts and expectations relating to yk compliance is forward looking 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this discussion should be read in conjunction with our disclosure under the heading forward looking statements that follows below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed that may adversely affect results of operations and financial position include changes in future interest rates and raw material prices 
we seek to minimize or manage these market risks through normal operating and financing activities and through the use of interest rate swap agreements and commodity futures and options contracts 
the use of these instruments is limited to hedging activities and they are not entered for trading or speculative purposes 
these agreements and contracts are entered into at a corporate level and as such  any income or expense associated with these transactions is not allocated to our reportable segments 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations 
our current debt structure consists of both fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swap agreements are used to effectively manage changes in interest rates related to the majority of our borrowings with the objective of reducing overall interest costs 
sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact that changes in market prices have on the fair value of interest rate swap agreements 
assuming a ten percent increase in market price  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at january   with a notional amount of million  would increase the net receivable to million  while the impact of a ten percent decrease in market price would result in a net payable of million 
we enter into commodity futures and options contracts to neutralize the impact of price increases on raw material purchases that are not likely to be recovered through higher prices on our products 
we also used sensitivity analysis to assess the potential impact on the fair value of commodity futures and options contracts 
assuming a ten percent increase or decrease in market price  the fair value of open contracts with a notional amount of million at january  would be impacted by million
