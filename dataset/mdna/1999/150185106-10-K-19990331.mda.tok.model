item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
partnership financial condition the partnership ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio of at december  is the result of the partnership s highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities and pre opening expenses as required 
in  cash generated from operations totaled million and new term loan borrowings totaled million 
the partnership used million to pay down revolving credit borrowings from the knott s berry farm acquisition  million for capital expenditures and million for distributions to the general and limited partners 
distributions in  at the current annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in the partnership has available through april a million revolving credit facility  of which million was borrowed and in use as of december  credit facilities and cash flow are expected to be adequate to meet seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions 
management s analysis of results of operations net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the year ended december  this followed a increase in when revenues rose to million  after a increase to in net revenues for reflect a increase in combined attendance to million from million in  a increase in combined guest per capita spending and an increase of in out of park revenues 
the results include knott s berry farm for a full year  while last year the park s results were included only for the three days following its acquisition on december  knott s berry farm s full year contribution accounted for most of the increase in combined attendance and revenue in attendance at the partnership s original four parks was up over due to the successful debuts of power tower at cedar point and mamba at worlds of fun  as well as improved weather at cedar point throughout the season 
in addition  dorney park continued to perform strongly in and achieved its second straight record year in dorney park and worlds of fun both had excellent years  which nearly offset attendance declines at cedar point and valleyfair caused by unusually cool and wet weather during important parts of the season  and combined attendance was down to million 
in  valleyfair achieved a record year and combined attendance increased to million  which included worlds of fun s first full year contribution 
combined guest per capita spending increased in and in costs and expenses before depreciation and amortization in increased to million from million in and million in  due to the inclusion of knott s berry farm s operations in included in costs and expenses are approximately million of incentive fees earned by the general partner in this compares to million and million of incentive fees earned in and  respectively 
operating income in increased to million  following a decrease in and an increase in the increase in operating income was the result of increases in attendance and guest per capita spending at each of the partnership s original four parks  together with knott s berry farm s full year profit contribution 
interest expense rose in due to the increased debt from the acquisition of knott s berry farm at the end of in operating income decreased as the result of attendance declines at cedar point and valleyfair 
in  increases in attendance at valleyfair and guest per capita spending at each of the parks  together with worlds of fun s first full year profit contribution  generated the increase in operating income 
net income for  after a million charge related to new taxes on publicly traded partnerships  increased to million  compared to million in and million in without the new taxes  net income would have increased to million  and earnings per limited partner unit would have increased to in from in on a diluted basis 
for  the partnership plans to invest million in capital improvements  including camp snoopy and the breakers tower hotel expansion at cedar point  and dorney park s new foot tall thrill ride  dominator an additional million has been invested in ghostrider  knott s berry farm s new wooden roller coaster  which opened in early december to very strong reviews and extensive media coverage  and million has been committed for the acquisition and renovation of the buena park hotel next to knott s 
we are optimistic that these major investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in our market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance at our parks 
historically  the partnership has been able to improve its profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in its parks 
this has enabled us to maintain a consistently high attendance level as well as steady increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations at cedar point while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
year disclosure the year issue is the result of many computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define a year 
such programs may recognize a year containing as the year rather than the year this could result in equipment or system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of daily operations for some organizations 
the partnership has completed its assessment of its computer dependent rides and equipment and its internal information systems that support business activities 
we believe that with minor modifications to existing hardware and software  the year issue will pose no significant internal operational problems 
in addition  the partnership has also assessed the readiness of its major utility and financial service providers to be year compliant  and we have no reason to believe that any third party with whom we have a material relationship will not be year compliant 
based upon the information obtained and accomplishments to date  no contingency plans are expected to be necessary and therefore none have been developed 
in addition  as daily operations at the partnership s four seasonal parks will not begin until april and may of  the partnership believes adequate time will be available if necessary to insure alternative plans can be developed  assessed and implemented prior to the year issue having any unforeseen significant negative impact on most of its principal operations 
however  if system modifications are not properly made or are not completed on a timely basis  or if one or more of our principal suppliers of essential utilities or financial services fail to operate normally  particularly at knott s berry farm which operates year round  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
both internal and external resources are being used to reprogram and or replace non compliant hardware and software  and to appropriately test year modifications  all funded through current operating cash flows 
the estimated total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to exceed million and thus will not be material to the partnership s financial position 
the cost of the project and the date on which the partnership believes it will substantially complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived from numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of computer programming expertise  the actual readiness of our major utility and financial service providers  and other factors 
because none of these estimates can be guaranteed  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of trained personnel  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties
