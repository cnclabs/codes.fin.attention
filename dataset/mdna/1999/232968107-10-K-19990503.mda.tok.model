the company s primary capital needs have consisted of acquisitions of inventory  financing accounts receivable and capital expenditures for product development 
the company s operating activities provided net cash of million during fiscal  consisting primarily of decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  and a net decrease in income taxes receivable and payable  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in prepaid expenses 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million and was the result of capital expenditures  increases in other assets and the payment of life insurance premiums on behalf of a shareholder 
net cash used by financing activities was million during fiscal and represented net payments under revolving lines of credit 
the company s working capital at january  was  and unrestricted cash was  the seasonal nature of the toy business results in complex working capital needs 
the company s working capital needs  which the company generally satisfies through short term borrowings  are greatest in the first two fiscal quarters 
to manage these working capital requirements  the company maintains a line of credit facility the hong kong credit facility with state street bank and trust company  hong kong branch  and the revolver 
as a result of losses incurred in fiscal  the company was not in compliance with certain of the covenants contained in its previous line of credit with a commercial bank at yearend

based on projected fiscal operating results  the company believes that cash flows from operations and the available borrowings under the revolver and the hong kong credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s operating cash requirements and fund the company s anticipated capital expenditures 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its projected operating results  and accordingly  the company is considering all of its financing alternatives 
in connection with any future cash needs or acquisition opportunities  the company may incur additional debt or issue additional equity or debt securities depending on market conditions and other factors 
if the transactions with mvii are consummated  the company will receive an additional equity infusion of million 
on april   the company entered into a stock purchase agreement with mvii  llc  a california limited liability company controlled by tom martin  which contemplates several related transactions i mvii purchased  shares of common stock from the company for million on april   ii mvii commenced a tender offer to purchase up to million shares of the outstanding common stock of the company at per share in cash on april   and iii subject to shareholder and other approvals  mvii will purchase an additional  shares of common stock subject to upward adjustments not to exceed in the aggregate  shares from the company for million simultaneously with the purchase of shares in the tender offer

these transactions are described in greater detail in the company s schedule d filed with the securities and exchange commission on april  the company is obligated to make future minimum royalty payments under certain of its license agreements 
as of january   the company was required to make an aggregrate of approximately  in payments of guaranteed royalties under certain licenses in fiscal and  thereafter through fiscal as part of the company s strategy  the company will evaluate potential acquisitions of other toy businesses or product lines that the company believes would complement its existing business 
the company has no present understanding or agreement with respect to any acquisition 
seasonality the toy industry is very seasonal with the christmas holiday season representing over two thirds of total annual retail toy sales 
the company has experienced this seasonal pattern in its net sales 
to accommodate this peak selling season  holiday toy lines are introduced early in the first calendar quarter 
retailers generally commit to their holiday season purchases during the first two calendar quarters and those orders are generally shipped to the retailers distribution centers on a scheduled basis from may through october 
during fiscal  of the company s net sales were made during the company s second and third fiscal quarters may through october  generally in connection with retail sales for the christmas holiday season 
as a result of the seasonality of the company s business  the company expects that it will incur a loss in the first quarter and fourth quarter of each fiscal year even in years in which the company is profitable for the year 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation in the united states or europe in recent years has had a significant effect on its results of operations 
year many existing computer systems and programs process transactions using two digits rather than four digits for the year of a transaction 
unless the hardware and or the software has been modified  a significant number of those computer systems and programs may process a transaction with a date of the year as the year  which could cause the system or the program to fail or create erroneous results before  on or after january  the yk issue 
the company s principal computer systems consist of i management information software mis for accounts receivable  general ledger  payables  order entry  sales reporting  inventory tracking  product distribution  and production scheduling  ii electronic data interchange edi for order taking  invoicing and the like between the company and its major customers  and iii local area network and personal computer operating systems 
the mis systems at the company s hong kong subsidiary have been upgraded and successfully tested to be yk compliant 
the mis systems at the company s us headquarters are in the process of being upgraded  replaced and tested 
to date  the company has completed approximately of its upgrades and replacements and approximately of its testing 
completion of all remediation and testing is expected to be completed by july  the company is currently reprogramming  or replacing  and testing the edi software 
the company is communicating with its customers to evaluate their edi yk compliance 
the company believes that over the upcoming months its major customers plan to test their edi systems for internal  intermediary and supplier yk compliance 
the company would be unable to receive and invoice orders from a customer though edi if the customer or its edi intermediaries were not yk compliant 
although the company does not transmit electronic orders to its independent manufacturers  delays or non delivery of goods to the company could arise from yk issues affecting their businesses and presently the company is communicating with its independent manufacturers to evaluate their yk compliance 
the effect of non compliance by independent manufacturers and other third parties is not determinable 
the company s local area network operating system will require upgrades according to vendors  but such upgrades are available at minimal cost 
the company also intends to replace personal computers and software found not to be yk compliant 
the company anticipates that these replacements will be completed by july  the company has incurred approximately  in expenses in connection with making its computer systems and programs yk compliant 
the company expects to incur additional yk costs of approximately  during the company is utilizing both internal and external sources to address yk issues  and the company anticipates yk compliance by july  all historical and future costs have been and will continue to be funded out of existing cash and cash flow from operations 
the failure to successfully address a material yk issue could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
particularly because of the uncertainty of the yk readiness of customers  suppliers and contractors  the company is unable to assess at this time whether the consequences of the yk issue will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company currently has not developed a detailed contingency plan 
the company assesses its yk status regularly and will begin to develop comprehensive contingency plans if the company believes it will not complete the yk project in a timely manner 
if the company s yk project is not completed on a timely basis  or if its major customers or suppliers fail to address all of the yk issues  the company believes it could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the cost of yk compliance and the referenced completion dates are based on management s best estimates and may be updated  as additional information becomes available 
reference is made to the first paragraph of part i of this report  which addresses forward looking statements made by the company
