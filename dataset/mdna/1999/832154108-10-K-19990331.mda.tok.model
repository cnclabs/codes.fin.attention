item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general smith micro software  inc develops and sells communications software for personal and business use 
our objective is to enhance human interaction by giving users the ability to communicate through multimedia technologies over analog and digital platforms 
smith micro s products enable personal communication through telephony  fax  multimedia email  data  paging  video security and video conferencing 
recently  we have been developing new products that leverage off our core technologies to address the consumer s use of the internet and corporate intranets 
we intend to leverage our experience and position with the original equipment manufacturers to deploy these new product releases 
additionally  we are expanding our customer base to include manufacturers that produce devices that take advantage of the high bandwidth internet connectivity such as cable and xdsl modems 
the company s corporate products are designed to provide cost effective and efficient methods of communicating that take advantage of corporate local and wide area networks  including the internet or intranet 
we shipped our first data communication software product in and  since that time  we have generated revenues primarily from the market acceptance of our oem fax and data communication software products 
we began providing video communication products in to both oem and retail customers 
in january  we purchased certain fax software assets of mitek systems  inc to provide lan  internet and intranet fax transmission solutions designed for the corporate market 
in september  we shipped our first internet communications software product 
this multi purpose product provides for integrated telephony  multimedia e mail  video security  fax  video conferencing and text based chat functionality over the internet and other ip protocol services such as lans and wans 
designed to take advantage of high bandwidth technology  this product functions over a variety of ip connectivity hardware including xdsl modems  cable modems  network interface devices and analog modems 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software as completed products are shipped and from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software 
any material reduction in demand for our products would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we continue to introduce new products  and our future success will depend in part on the continued introduction of new and enhanced oem  retail and corporate products that achieve market acceptance 
revenues are net of estimated returns and other adjustments at the time the products are shipped 
we have allowed our customers to return unused software and to rotate stock for new versions of retail releases 
as a percentage of our net revenues  returns constituted in  in and in as a percentage of our net revenues  returns for stock rotation were in  in and in a small number of our customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
in june  com corporation acquired our largest customer to date  us robotics corporation 
sales to com  primarily u 
s robotics and its subsidiaries  accounted for approximately of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in our three largest oem customers  including com  accounted for the following portions of our net revenues in  in and in any reduction  delay or change in orders from such customers could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the oem product ordering cycle beginning from placement of an order to shipment is very short 
oem customers generally operate under a just in time system and order software to be delivered as needed by their manufacturing operations 
we generally ship our products as we receive orders  and  accordingly  we have historically operated with little backlog 
we do not consider backlog to be a significant indication of future performance 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
moreover  we generally do not produce software in advance of orders and  therefore  have not maintained a material amount of software inventory 
inventory in the retail channel exposes us to product returns 
we consider this exposure when we establish allowances for product returns 
substantial returns of product from the retail channel could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
historical results of operations  percentage relationships and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentages of net revenues represented by each item in our statement of income 
year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss compared to net revenues our net revenues decreased to million for from million for this decrease in our revenue was the result of a decrease in sales to our largest oem analog modem customers  including com 
the decrease in sales resulted from a combination of factors  including changes in product mix resulting from the analog modem industry s acceptance of the v  k modem standard  reduced demand of certain fax products and pricing pressures within the analog modem industry 
in response to these factors  our revenues from sales to com in decreased when compared to this decrease in our revenues from analog modem manufacturers was partially offset by an increase in revenues from other oem customers  including pc manufacturers  and increased retail revenues 
during  net retail revenues increased approximately over net retail revenues 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues  less cost of revenues  which includes cost of materials  costs related to the operations of our duplication facilities  freight charges and royalties to licensors 
our gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to in compared to in the increase in our gross profit percentage was due to a shift in our product mix  our flexible manufacturing process and our improvement of controls over our manufacturing expenses 
these improvements were partially offset by the translation costs of certain software products 
operating expenses our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as a percent of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in from in the increase in our sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased expenditures for our major retail products  including expenditures related to the introduction of internet commsuite  a multi function internet communications software product 
expenditures for our corporate and var product group  primarily our lan fax products  also increased in our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
in  research and development expenses remained constant at million as compared to as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenditures increased to in from in an increase in the amortization of purchased technologies  primarily for the network fax technology that we acquired in  was offset by a reduction in salaries and benefits 
to date  we have not capitalized any of our software development expenses because our development efforts have been completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
however  significant new products that we develop in the future may require the capitalization of certain software development expenses 
our general and administrative expenses include expenses related to our general operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenditures increased to in from in  primarily due to the decrease in our net revenues 
the overall decrease was primarily due to the lower allowance for bad debt in and cost control measures that reduced most expense categories during income taxes during  our income tax benefit was of the loss before income taxes 
income tax benefit was million in and  in compared to net revenues our net revenues decreased to million for from million for this decrease consisted of a decrease in oem sales and an decrease in retail sales in compared with the oem decrease was the result of a combination of decreased unit volume  which we believe was primarily driven by the lack of a k modem standard during  and an increased percentage of net revenues resulting from royalty agreements 
these factors contributed to decreased revenues from sales to com of in and to decreased revenues from sales to motorola of in the decrease in retail sales was primarily driven by slower than anticipated sales of our video communication software product lines 
we believe that these product lines continue to be impacted by consumers lack of acceptance of current video technology and pricing 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues  less cost of revenues  which includes cost of materials  costs related to the operations of our duplication facilities  freight charges and royalties to licensors 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to in compared to in an increased percentage of revenue from royalty agreements  cost control measures and increased manufacturing efficiencies helped us to achieve only a slight decrease in gross profit percentage despite the decrease in our sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased primarily due to the decrease in our net revenues  an increase in our inventory write offs  which resulted from releases of new version retail product releases during  and an increase in our royalty expenses  which were primarily related to our video products 
operating expenses our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in from in our sales and marketing expenditures increased primarily due to our promotional campaigns in the retail channel during the first half of the year combined with an increase in personnel 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
our research and development expenses remained constant at million in compared to as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenditures increased to in from in an increase in the amortization of purchased technologies related to our video communication software was offset by a decrease in all other research and development expense categories 
to date  we have not capitalized any of our software development expenses because our development efforts have been completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
however  significant new products that we develop in the future may require the capitalization of certain software development expenses 
our general and administrative expenses include expenses related to our general operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  our general and administrative expenditures increased to in from in our cost control efforts reduced general and administrative expenses in most categories  particularly salaries and benefits  however  this reduction was offset by an increase in bad debt reserves 
we increased bad debt reserves due to slower payment patterns from our customers that were largely influenced by slower than anticipated sales of our retail video communication software products 
income taxes during  our income tax benefit was of the loss before income taxes 
income tax benefit was  in and the income tax expense was million in the effective tax rate during differed from the statutory federal rate of  principally because of nondeductible acquired in process research and development costs of million and state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations 
net cash used in operations was  for and  for net cash provided by operating activities was  in in  the cash used in our operations was primarily the result of our net loss for the year and an increase in accounts receivable that was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to an increase in our retail activities during the later portion of the year 
the cash provided by operations in was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable that was offset by a net loss for the year 
the decrease in cash provided from operations in was primarily the result of increased accounts receivable and income taxes receivable  and increased operating costs  primarily in research and development expenditures 
we used  in cash in   in and million in  for investing activities 
our primary use of cash for investing activities related to our acquisition of technology from mitek in and the purchase of performance computing incorporated in we also invested in property and equipment  including computers and production equipment  during each of  and during and  we did not use or generate cash from financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities during of million was primarily for the repayment of notes to our founders 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we had million in accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and other adjustments 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent years 
year compliance smith micro is aware of issues associated with computer systems as the year approaches 
many currently installed computer systems and software applications are coded to accept only two digit entries to identify the year in the date code field  without considering the impact of the change in the century 
as a result  in less than one year  computer systems and or software used in many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
we believe that year issues could affect the internal systems used to operate and monitor our business  our third party vendors and customers and our software products 
significant uncertainty exists in the computer industry concerning the potential effects associated with such year issues 
we believe that we have identified substantially all of the major internal systems and software applications that are important to the operation and monitoring of our business 
we have obtained confirmation from vendors of certain purchased systems and software applications used for our internal operations that current releases or upgrades  if installed  are designed to be year compliant 
we have recently completed the installation of such upgrades to our current systems 
we believe that with the upgrades  modifications and conversions we have made to date  the year issue will not have a material impact on our internal systems 
however  it is possible that the systems and software applications used for our internal operations contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
we currently estimate that the total cost remaining  after december   to address our year issues is insignificant 
this estimate is based on assumptions that include our assumption that the we have already identified the most significant year issues and that the plans of our third party suppliers and customers will be fulfilled in a timely manner at no cost to us 
all remaining year issue costs will be funded through operating cash flows 
we are currently in the process of evaluating our critical external relationships  including relationships with both third party vendors and customers  to determine the extent to which we may be vulnerable to the failure of such third parties to resolve their own year issues 
we are gathering information through direct communication with third parties  sec filings  information provided by the third parties corporate web sites and product marketing documentation 
third parties being evaluated include  among others  software duplication vendors  freight companies  payroll service providers and our largest customers 
where practicable  we will assess and attempt to mitigate our risks with respect to failure of these entities to be year ready 
the effect  if any  on our results of operations from the failure of such parties to be year ready is not reasonably estimable 
we currently offer software products that are designed to be year compliant 
our software products do not utilize dates in their primary functions 
we have evaluated our software products and their interaction with hardware  such as fax machines  and possible software applications  such as word processors  and believe that year problems will not affect the functionality of its software products 
however  it is possible that our products  or the hardware or software applications used by one of our customers  may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
although we are not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing our products or internal information systems for the year  it is possible that we may experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems  which are composed predominantly of third party software and hardware 
if we are not completely successful in mitigating our internal and external year risks  we could experience a system failure or disruptions in our operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
we are currently developing contingency plans to address the year issues that may pose a significant risk to our ongoing operations 
we believe  that under a worst case scenario  we could continue the majority of our normal business activities with the use of manual processing  alternate suppliers and an accelerated program of replacement for equipment or software applications 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk smith micro s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
