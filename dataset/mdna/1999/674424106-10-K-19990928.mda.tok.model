item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview osi provides oss software that simplifies the integration and management of communications networks in large scale  complex  multi vendor environments 
we were founded in june and began shipments of our netexpert product line in august of in fiscal  we announced our next generation framework product  netexpert virtual service management vsm and the netexel solution services applications 
these new products reduce deployment time and reduce the expertise needed for customization of our products 
as of june   we had directly or indirectly licensed our products to over customers around the world 
revenue from licenses  service and support of the netexpert product line has accounted for substantially all of our revenues since our inception 
a typical netexpert sale generally includes a combination of license fees  fees for professional services and fees for customer support and training 
we believe that revenue from the license  service and support of our netexpert product line including vsm  will account for substantially all of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
a significant portion of revenues has been  and will continue to be  derived from substantial orders placed by large organizations 
the timing of these orders and their fulfillment has caused  and may continue to cause  material fluctuations in operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we believe that our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of revenue and results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
we also believe that quarterly revenues should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
we distribute and sell netexpert products to end users in north america primarily through a direct sales organization 
outside of north america  we sell through systems integrators  local value added resellers and  to a lesser extent  an in region direct sales force 
we intend to enter into additional international markets and to continue to grow our international operations by expanding our direct sales force  opening new in region customer support and sales offices  adding value added resellers and pursuing additional strategic relationships 
results of operations revenues in thousands  except percentages fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change licenses    percentage of revenues services and other    percentage of revenues total revenues    our revenues are derived from license fees and fees for services that complement our products  including professional services  software support  customer support and training 
in fiscal  total revenues increased over those in fiscal this was primarily due to increased sales in our european  latin american and asia pacific regions 
these increases were partially offset by decreased domestic sales 
service revenues also increased in fiscal because of higher maintenance and support revenues from a larger customer base 
in fiscal  total revenues grew over those in fiscal because of increased sales to new and existing customers  coupled with an overall increase in our services revenues 
the increase in service revenue was a reflection of a higher percentage of sales being made to emerging service providers  who typically require a higher level of professional services to implement new solutions 
list prices for our products and services did not change significantly during the comparison periods 
however  we are currently instituting a new pricing model which will provide customers with additional choices when purchasing software licenses 
license revenues 
software licenses have generally been granted and priced on a per server basis  although we have granted site  network wide or enterprise wide licenses for larger installations 
in future periods  licenses may be granted on either a per server basis or on other bases 
we generally recognize license revenues when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
we recognize revenue under contracts requiring significant customization using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  based on the ratio of incurred costs to total estimated costs 
although generally our license agreements do not provide for a right of return  we maintain reserves for returns and potential credit losses 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we expensed approximately million  million and million respectively  to reserves for sales returns 
this was done to reflect perceived risks associated with actual and potential customer returns 
license revenues increased in fiscal over our license revenues in fiscal  both in actual dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
this can mainly be attributed to increased sales in our data ip and wireline market segments 
in fiscal  license revenues increased over those in fiscal in actual dollars  but and declined as a percentage of our total revenues 
the decline as a percentage of revenues was primarily a function of increased sales  the timing of completion of network deployment cycles and increased orders for customization services 
we anticipate that our license revenues will continue to represent a majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  we also believe that historic growth rates in our license revenues should not be used as an indication of growth rates for future periods 
we expect that implementation of new strategies or pricing models may have an effect on our revenues 
while the number of orders placed by new and existing customers may increase  the license revenue per customer may potentially be reduced in any given reporting period 
we also believe that competition in our markets is increasing 
this could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
services and other revenues 
we recognize revenues for training  consulting and professional services as the services are performed and acceptance criteria have been met 
we offer month support contracts to our customers 
these contracts provide telephone support  updates and maintenance of netexpert framework during the support period 
maintenance revenues from our support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement 
payments for support fees are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable 
during fiscal  service and other revenues increased over those in fiscal in absolute dollars  but declined as a percentage of our total revenues 
the growth in absolute dollars represents increased maintenance revenues from a larger customer base with an increased number of netexpert licenses 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues reflects our increased license revenues 
during fiscal  revenues from our professional services declined over those we reported in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased orders in the emerging service provider market 
in fiscal and fiscal we experienced an increase in the orders from the emerging service providers as they built and deployed their network operations 
in fiscal  the emerging service providers had their networks in place and we experienced a reduced demand for professional services 
osi s revenues were associated with framework and the expansion of the customers existing network systems 
our services and other revenues increased as a percentage of our total revenues in fiscal this was mainly a function of the higher percentage of revenues we derived from new and emerging service providers 
as noted above in the overview section  the nature of the solutions acquired by these customers and their lack of sufficient staff to implement them internally often leads to a higher reliance on osi s professional services 
we expect that our services and other revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
we anticipate a continued demand for professional services in connection with licenses of netexpert vsm  the renewal of existing support contracts and incremental support revenues attributable to a growing installed base of our products 
we also believe that prior growth rates for services and other revenues may not be sustainable and should not be relied on as an indication of growth rates in the future 
international revenues 
revenues from outside of the united states represented  and of total revenues for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenues from customers in the asia pacific region accounted for of total revenues in fiscal this compares with of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal we believe that the weakened economic conditions in this region have had a slightly negative effect on our growth rate over the last two years 
however  we also believe that  if the overall economic climate in the region continues to improve  the impact on our business will lessen 
further  there can be no assurances that the economies in asia pacific will recover in the near term  or that similar economic problems will not occur in other parts of the world 
there can also be no assurances that if economies in asia pacific do improve  this will positively impact our business 
revenues from european customers accounted for of total revenues in fiscal this compares with of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenues in future periods 
we intend to enter additional international markets and to continue expanding our existing international operations 
our international business involves a number of inherent risks  including longer receivable collection periods  greater difficulty in collections  fluctuations in the real cost of our products given changes in relative exchange rates  difficulty in staffing and managing operations  a longer sales cycle  potentially unstable political and economic conditions  language barriers  cultural differences  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecommunications services providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  potentially adverse tax consequences  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  access to foreign markets is often difficult due to the established relationships between government owned or controlled communications providers and local suppliers of communications products 
we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to continue penetrating international markets successfully 
in addition  we cannot give any assurances we will be able to sustain or increase revenue from international licensing and services or that the factors listed above will not adversely affect our future international business 
any of these factors could have a material  adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
cost of revenues in thousands  except percentages fiscal year fiscal year fiscal change change year cost of license revenues    percentage of revenues cost of services and other revenues    percentage of revenues total cost of revenues    percentage of revenues gross profit    percentage of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of license fees paid to third party software vendors and the costs of product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials  shipping expenses  amortization of capitalized software costs and related labor costs 
in fiscal  the cost of license revenues  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  remained relatively flat compared with fiscal although our license revenues increased in fiscal over those in fiscal  the cost of our license revenues did not increase proportionately because we were able to achieve cost savings by reducing the cost of third party software licenses 
however  these cost savings were partially offset by increased costs related to the amortization of purchased technologies 
in fiscal  our cost of license revenues in actual dollars increased over fiscal  while our cost of license revenues as a percentage of revenues remained constant 
this can be attributed to the increase in our services and other revenues 
the increase was due mainly to the increased volume of business  which yielded increased costs for third party products and technology embedded in our products 
gross profit from license revenues was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal respectively 
the costs for license fees paid for third party software decreased slightly during the period 
however  we expect to continue licensing third party software and expect these costs are likely to increase in absolute dollars 
cost of services and other revenues 
cost of services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel costs related to providing professional services and maintenance services in connection with the licensing of our products 
it also includes outside service fees paid to third party providers of professional services  related travel costs  overhead and estimated losses related to professional services contracts 
professional services costs decreased in fiscal over those in fiscal due to lower head count and associated personnel costs  such as salaries  facilities and communications costs 
costs of service revenues for maintenance services increased in fiscal over those in fiscal this can be attributed to increased computer related costs and services performed for customer support by other functional areas within osi 
we expect costs of services and other revenues may continue to increase in absolute dollars 
cost of service and other revenues remained relatively unchanged between fiscal and fiscal this is primarily because total professional services costs were flat in fiscal when compared with fisca in fiscal  we spent million for contractors 
in  we spent million for contractors and accrued million for estimated losses on professional services contracts 
however  the savings in contractor costs was offset by the addition of head count over the course of the year 
the overall result was a slight increase in cost of services and other revenues 
gross profit loss percentages from service and other revenues were  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal respectively 
we expect to maintain a gross profit in services  however  if costs for providing such services increase there could be losses in the future 
operating expenses in thousands  except percentages fiscal year fiscal fiscal change year change year sales and marketing    percentage of revenues research and development    percentage of revenues general and administrative    percentage of revenues total operating expenses    percentage of revenues sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist mainly of salaries  commissions and bonuses for sales and marketing personnel  facilities costs associated with sales and customer support offices  promotional expenses and contract administration 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased over those fiscal  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
this decline can be attributed to lower head count and a reduction in associated costs such as travel  communications and computer expenses 
in addition  there was a reduction in our use of outside contractors for strategic marketing efforts during the comparison period 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars during fiscal when compared with fiscal was mainly caused by a higher average head count and higher commission expenses resulting from increased revenues 
during this period  there were also increased expenses in product marketing  travel  communications and facilities 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in future periods will continue to increase in absolute dollars due  in part  to our active hiring program and to agreements with various partners who are involved in the marketing of our products 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses could increase as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to roll out our new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal over those in fiscal the increase results primarily from higher head count attributable to completion of new products 
higher costs were also incurred in fiscal for travel  facilities  communications and computer related expenses because of the increased head count in research and development 
in fiscal  research and development expenses increased over those in fiscal this was mainly the result of increased head count  salary levels and associated equipment  facilities and support for technical personnel 
we expect that we will continue committing significant resources to research and development to enhance and extend our core technology and product lines 
we also expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal affairs and general management 
also included are outside legal and accounting fees  corporate insurance expenses  provision for bad debts  and in  a million management restructuring charge 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased over those in fiscal  both in actual dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
this was the result of lower head count and reduced travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenues  from those in fiscal the decline was due mainly to a decrease in bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses of  in fiscal and million in fiscal employee relocation expenses were also reduced from  in fiscal to  in fiscal general and administrative expenses may increase in the future with continued growth and the hiring of additional personnel 
although we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate at the end of fiscal  we will continue to review this allowance and adjust it as needed 
this could result in additional charges to general and administrative expenses 
we have recorded deferred compensation expense for certain stock options granted since february the amortization of deferred compensation expense is allocated among sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
the amortization resulted in a charge to operations of   and  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the deferred compensation expense has been completely amortized as of june  other income  net in thousands  except percentages fiscal year fiscal year fiscal change change year other income  net    percentage of revenues other income  net 
other income  net is primarily interest income from marketable securities and cash accounts 
the decline in other income  net was due to lower interest income from reduced levels of cash and short term investments 
provision benefit for income taxes dollars in thousands fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year change change provision benefit for income taxes    percentage of revenues not meaningful provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective tax rates for these periods differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes  partially offset by certain research and development tax credits 
in fiscal year  we set up a reserve for the balance of our deferred tax assets 
for a further explanation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year readiness we are continuing our program to assess the extent to which our internal systems and products evaluate date information year dependencies and  if so  whether they can properly process and evaluate dates on or after the year ie whether they are year compliant 
we have been taking remedial action where systems and products are not year compliant 
we also regularly re evaluate our contingency plans for continuing operations if year problems arise despite steps to avoid them 
we expect that remediation activities will continue throughout fiscal we believe that we have identified the year dependencies in our internal systems 
we have examined all critical systems including manufacturing  sales  development  communications and financial systems 
we have also examined many of our non computer electronic devices that contain microprocessors for example  telephones  security systems  and hvac systems 
as dependencies are identified  we have taken the remediation measures necessary for our internal systems to be year compliant 
no significant internal systems projects are being deferred due to year remediation costs 
in most instances  installation of new software or hardware that is year compliant has been occurring in the normal course of our business 
we currently expect that the year problem will not pose significant internal operational issues 
we are not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing our internal systems for the year however  we can give no assurances that we will not experience unanticipated material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in those systems 
delays in or a failure to fully identify all of our year dependencies in our internal systems could result in delays in the delivery or sale of products 
this could have material adverse consequences on our business 
therefore  we have put in place  and are regularly re evaluating  contingency plans for continuing operations should these types of problems arise 
we depend on critical suppliers and vendors  and therefore on the proper functioning of their information systems and software  this means that their failure to address year issues could have a material effect on our operations and financial results 
as of this date  we are not aware of any critical systems suppliers or vendors that will not be year compliant 
however  we will continue our assessments and  depending on the particular situation  may identify alternative suppliers or vendors 
we have developed contingency plans for critical system failures or delays involving suppliers that are not year compliant 
we expect to continue revisiting these plans through most of fiscal we have contacted key suppliers to determine the extent to which they believe their products and operations are year compliant 
we have contacted providers of both products and services in areas such as network and communications infrastructure  manufacturing  facilities management  finance and human resources 
our suppliers were asked to notify us if they would not be year compliant 
to date there has been no indication from key suppliers that they are not  or will not be  year compliant 
we will continue testing and analyzing vendor systems as necessary 
we are also continuing to work with key suppliers of third party software products and services that are used in connection with netexpert vsm based products 
we continue to monitor their reported progress toward year compliance and compatibility with year compliant versions of netexpert vsm 
we are not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with these suppliers regarding year compliance 
however  no assurances can be given that we will not experience unanticipated material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in these third party software products 
delays in remediation or a failure to identify all of our year dependencies could result in material adverse consequences to our business and results of operations 
we have evaluated all of our current products and have taken measures to bring them into year compliance 
we do not intend to develop modifications to early versions of our products or to customized deliverables that are no longer under warranty 
we have advised each of our customers of our year compliance standards 
year compliant versions of available products have been offered at no additional charge to those customers who have maintenance and support contracts 
most of our customers have already migrated to year compliant versions of our products 
we have also offered our customers professional services to assist in the migration of their netexpert based implementations to year compliant versions 
despite our remediation efforts  we can give no assurances that our year compliant products will function properly when they are integrated with other non compliant products  including previously customized osi software  third party software  and hardware 
our products are used in numerous operating environments and we can also give no assurance that they will be compliant in all environments 
even though we believe we have taken measures to bring our current products into year compliance  our customers may nevertheless experience year difficulties because of the noncompliance of other products that interoperate with them  whether they are provided by us  the customer or a third party 
if our products are not able to manage and manipulate data related to the year  the result could be a material adverse effect on our business 
we will be offering fee based additional support to cover the time period before and after the new year 
this support will cover any production system failures that occur at our customer sites 
we plan to have additional professional services and customer support personnel on call to handle any customer s production system failure 
to date  we have incurred costs related to our year readiness program but have not maintained separate cost accounting for them 
year readiness efforts have been undertaken by existing employees  and costs have been treated as normal operating expense 
these costs have included testing and modifying our computer network and our principal products 
they have also included modification of certain products and other deliverables including customized osi software rulesets and applications where we have contractually agreed to provide year compliant versions 
as of june   we estimate these costs to be approximately million 
we expect to incur additional costs for our year readiness program related to customer support and customer service requests 
we currently estimate these additional costs will not exceed million over the remainder of the calendar year 
this does not include potential costs related to customer or other claims  or costs related to internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
we believe we have adequate general corporate funds with which to pay for expected costs and expenditures related to year readiness 
this belief is based on our current assessment and is subject to change as our year readiness program progresses 
we have provided our customers with limited assurances regarding those of our products that comply with the year standards that we have adopted 
except as specifically provided for in the contracts and limited written assurances that we have provided  we do not believe we are legally responsible for costs incurred by our customers to ensure the year compliance of their software  systems and operations 
our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit liability for these types of claims 
however  it is possible that these provisions will not provide adequate protection from liability under applicable laws  regulations  codes or ordinances  or under unfavorable judicial decisions 
even if we have disclaimed responsibility for any year problems  or identified and notified our customers of them  a given customer may nevertheless make claims against all suppliers of the component parts of their operating environment 
any year claims  whether with or without merit  could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario involving year will involve the corruption of data contained in internal information systems  hardware failures and the failure of third party systems 
we believe our greatest risk lies with the potential failure of third party systems rather than with our internal systems or products 
we have only minimal ability to assess and remediate the year problems of third parties 
we believe the greatest detrimental effect on our business would occur if infrastructure services such as electricity  telecommunications  transportation supply chains or suppliers of materials were inoperable 
we rely on local private and governmental suppliers for electricity  water  sewer and other needed supplies 
failure of an electrical grid or an uneven supply of power could completely shut down the affected facility 
it could also shut down airports and other means of transportation 
critical suppliers could be partially or completely shut down and unable to provide supplies on a timely basis 
we may not be able to obtain a replacement supplier in a timely manner  on acceptable terms or at all 
while we do not maintain the ability to replace third party supplies with internal production  contingency planning includes the ongoing assessment and identification of substitute suppliers 
among other things  contingency plans for a major infrastructure failure might include a shift in production to another unaffected site 
we plan to install a back up generator in our new facility to provide partial power to our core functional areas 
we believe that the purchasing patterns of our customers and potential customers will be affected by the year issues as they bring their current software systems into year compliance 
funds available to purchase new products could be reduced 
given the overall uncertainty of the situation  customers or potential customers may delay the purchase and introduction of any new functionality until after the year transition has been completed 
although unknown at this time  potential changes in purchasing patterns such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
factors that may affect future results quarterly results 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and can be expected to vary significantly in the future 
the fluctuation in quarterly license revenues is caused by the timing of large orders by our customers  including global telecommunication providers and the emerging communication service providers described in the overview section 
orders are typically preceded by long sales cycles and  accordingly  it has been and will continue to be difficult to predict when they will be received 
we expect that quarterly license revenues will continue to vary significantly depending on the timing of our orders 
the failure to obtain an order during any given reporting period  for whatever reason  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we typically receive a significant portion of our orders  and record the resulting revenue  in the last month of a quarter and frequently in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenues are below expectations  operating results can be adversely affected 
in particular  because only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenue  net income may be disproportionately affected by a decrease from anticipated revenue 
we believe this pattern will continue 
our quarterly operating results have also varied and will vary significantly based on factors such as the capital spending patterns of our customers  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  increased competition  cancellation of licenses or support agreements  changes in operating expenses  personnel changes  fluctuation in demand for netexpert vsm based products  the number  timing and significance of new products and product enhancements by us and by our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of netexpert vsm based products on a timely basis  the mix of direct and indirect sales  our assessment of our allowance for bad debts  sales returns  and general economic factors  among others 
because of these factors  quarterly revenue and operating results have been and will continue to be difficult to forecast 
sales cycle 
revenues are also difficult to forecast because the sales cycle  from initial evaluation to product installation  varies substantially from customer to customer 
purchase of an oss application generally involves a significant commitment of capital  with the attendant time requirements often associated with a customer s internal approval procedures 
it also involves the need to test and accept new technologies that affect crucial operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle for our products is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
key personnel 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the continuing contributions of key management  sales  professional services  customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of  or the inability to attract and retain  key personnel could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced and continue to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified employees in the software industry  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the people we need 
the complex nature of customers networks requires that we recruit and hire personnel with expertise in  and a broad understanding of  the telecommunications industry 
there are only a limited number of qualified personnel available for employment 
failure to attract and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business condition 
growth 
to compete effectively and manage future growth  we also need to improve our internal operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls in a timely manner to accommodate a larger numbers of transactions and customers 
management of future growth also means that we must expand  train  motivate and manage our workforce 
we can give no assurances that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support existing and future operations 
the failure to improve operational  financial and management systems  or to expand  train  motivate and manage employees  could have a material adverse effect on our financial business 
product defects 
in addition  software products as complex as those we offer are highly likely to contain defects when they are introduced or when new versions are released 
although we are not aware of any material software defects in our products  we can give no assurances  despite extensive testing both by us and by our customers  that errors will not be found after commercial licensing begins 
this could result in delayed or lost revenue  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition 
our products are designed for use in an evolving network operations support and management applications market 
competition in this market is intense  with rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our competitors offer a variety of solutions to address this market 
we believe that competition will increase 
most of our customers regularly evaluate whether to design and develop their own network operations support and management applications or to purchase them from outside vendors 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not develop products that are comparable or superior to ours or that they will no be able to adapt more quickly than we are to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changes in customer requirements 
if we are not able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
international business 
we expect that our international business will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
we intend to enter into additional international markets and to continue expanding our operations outside of north america 
this will require significant management attention and the expenditure of significant financial resources 
the result could adversely affect our operating margins 
historically  our transactions have been primarily in us dollars 
however  as we further expand our operations outside the united states  transactions in non us currencies will necessarily increase 
this will result in a corresponding increase in our exchange rate risk 
if exchange rates change unfavorably  this could result in charges to operations 
although we have tried to reduce the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates by pricing our products and services in u 
s 
dollars  we pay our local expenses in local currencies 
we do not engage in hedging transactions with respect to those obligations 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we license our products could have a materially adverse effect on our business by making our pricing non competitive with products priced in local currencies 
reseller relationships 
a key element of our future business strategy is to develop relationships with leading companies that manufacture and market telecommunications equipment 
another key element of that strategy is to expand system integrator and value added reseller channels of distribution 
we are currently investing and plan to continue investing significant resources to develop these relationships and channels of distribution 
we can give no assurances that we will be able to attract additional systems integrators and resellers that can market our product effectively 
if we are unable to develop these relationships and market our products effectively  our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
proprietary technology 
our success and ability to compete depends in large part on our proprietary software technology 
we rely on a combination of various technical measures  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  and nondisclosure and other contractual agreements to protect proprietary rights 
despite our efforts  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
we can give no assurances that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
these precautions may also not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
while we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  we can give no assurances that there will not be infringement claims in the future as the number of products and competitors in the industry increases 
any such claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
this could result in a material adverse impact on our business 
third party software 
finally  we rely on software licensed from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used to perform key functions 
we can give no assurances that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
absence of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business 
based upon all of the above  we believe that our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in the future 
we also believe that period to period comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
further  we believe that it is likely that our revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarter 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock could be materially  adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
this compares with a net increase of million in fiscal and a net decrease of million in fiscal the decline in fiscal can mainly be attributed to net cash used for operations of million  purchases of property and equipment and other assets of million  and the purchase of treasury stock of million 
the net cash used for operations was derived primarily from our million net loss  partially offset by our adjustment for deferred income taxes of million 
net cash provided from financing activities million was generated by the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  the net increase in our cash and cash equivalents came mainly from sale of short term investments million and from the sale of stock options million 
these sources of cash were offset by million of cash used in our operations 
the decline in net cash was primarily caused by a loss from operations million  partially offset by depreciation  amortization million  an increase in accounts receivable million and an increase in deferred revenue million 
in fiscal  our net decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our purchases of million in short term investments  million in property and equipment and the purchase of assets from our australian distributor 
this was partially offset by net cash generated by operations of million 
this occurred because our million net loss was more than offset by adjustments for depreciation and amortization  net decreases in accounts receivable  decreases in income tax refunds receivable  an increase in accounts payable and increases in accrued liabilities 
as of june   we had working capital of approximately million 
this included million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
under this line of credit  which expires in december  borrowings bear interest at either a fluctuating rate per year equal to the prime lending rate then in effect  or a fixed rate per year that is above the london inter bank offered rate 
as of june   no amounts had been borrowed under the line of credit 
the agreement for the line has certain financial covenants and  as of june   we complied with those covenants 
some of our accounts receivable are beyond their payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that we believe is adequate to cover potential credit losses 
in fiscal  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million to reflect what we believed to be increased exposure on certain accounts receivable 
in fiscal  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by million and in fiscal it was increased by million 
on june   reserves for bad debt and sales returns were about million 
we believe our present reserves are adequate to provide for potential credit losses or sales returns 
we currently have material commitments of approximately million for tenant improvements and computer equipment for our new facilities 
we also intend to continue growing our operations 
in fiscal  we spent million for capital items  principally computer hardware  computer software and communications equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures will continue to be significant in fiscal and in the future 
we believe that our cash balances and our cash flow from operations are sufficient to support our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations cannot satisfy working capital requirements  we may need to raise additional funds 
financing may not be available or  if it is  it may not be obtainable on terms that are favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  ownership dilution to stockholders will result 
if funds are unavailable  our business may be adversely affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk based on a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists of cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are stated at cost 
we do not believe our exposure to interest rate risk is material for these balances  which were million on june  the securities in our short term investment portfolio are generally classified as available for sale 
short term investments were million on june  we do not use derivative financial investments in our short term investment portfolio  we place our investments with high quality issuers  and by policy  limit our credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and attempt to ensure the safety of our investment funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from the rates in effect on june   the fair value of our cash equivalents and short term investments would change by an insignificant amount 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global business  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial position 
historically  our primary exposure has related to local currency expenses in europe  the asia pacific region and australia 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are local 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would have an insignificant impact on our business  operating results and financial position
