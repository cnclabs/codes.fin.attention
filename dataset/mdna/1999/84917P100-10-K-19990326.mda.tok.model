following such date  we have consolidated the operations of reebok sports club ny with our other consolidated operations 
the spectrum club manhattan beach is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in july  we opened the spectrum club valencia 
in august  we acquired a sports and fitness club in henderson  nevada which we converted to the sports club las vegas in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
on december   we acquired four clubs in southern california in a transaction accounted for as a purchase  one of these clubs was leased to another health and fitness operator in january  the other three clubs are now operated as spectrum clubs 
in november we closed the spectrum club santa monica 
seasonal factors have not had a significant effect on our operating results 
results of operations fiscal our revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for  an increase of million or 
an increase of million resulted from revenue at our new clubs acquired and or opened during the last six months of revenue growth of million resulted from the remaining clubs and sportsmed 
our direct operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the clubs acquired and or opened during the last six months of direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for compared for operating margins continued to improve at reebok sports club ny as membership levels at this club continued to mature 
lower operating margins at the recently acquired clubs partially offset this increase 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for selling costs increased approximately  primarily due to clubs acquired and or opened during the last six months of general and administrative costs increased by approximately million as we added corporate overhead to support the six new clubs and the growth of sportsmed 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of revenue from for to for we believe these costs should continue to decrease as a percentage of future revenues as we expand and achieve economies of scale 
there is no assurance  however  that said expansion or economies of scale will be achieved 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase is primarily due to the addition of depreciation and amortization at the clubs acquired and or opened during the last six months of interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for interest expense decreased due to the payoff of the note secured by the sports club la in april with the proceeds of a common stock offering

these amounts are associated with improved profits at the spectrum club manhattan beach operations

direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for compared to for due to lower margins at reebok sports club ny and the spectrum club valencia 
newly developed clubs historically operate at lower margins due to various fixed expenses such as rent  utilities and certain payroll costs until the membership reaches a mature level 
similarly  newly acquired clubs may also perform at lower margins prior to and during implementation of new policies and programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for selling costs increased approximately  due to the consolidation of direct selling expenses incurred at reebok sports club ny  the opening of the spectrum club valencia and the acquisition of the sports club las vegas

selling  general and administrative costs decreased as a percentage of revenue from for to for this percentage decrease resulted from the consolidation of reebok sports club ny revenues 
the consolidation of revenues from reebok sports club ny did not increase general and administrative costs because we managed the club and accrued these costs prior to the consolidation 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was due primarily to the consolidation of reebok sports club ny  the opening of the spectrum club valencia and the acquisition of the sports club las vegas 
interest expense was million in the year ended december   compared to million for interest expense of  at reebok sports club ny and interest on new equipment financings was partially offset by increased interest income due to more available cash for investment and lower principal balances as other indebtedness matured

in december  we acquired four clubs from racquetball world 
three of these clubs are now operated as spectrum clubs  and one club was leased to another health and fitness operator in january millennium acquired properties underlying two of the clubs for million and is leasing these properties to us under a financing lease agreement which is reflected as a capital lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have the right until december to purchase the leased property from millennium for a purchase price determined pursuant to the lease currently estimated to be approximately million 
millennium has the right under certain circumstances to require us to acquire its interest in the property 
see certain relationships and related transactions 
we have entered into an agreement to sell one of these clubs and intend to purchase millennium s interest in these properties with the sale proceeds 
we are also developing three clubs with millennium as described below in new club development

we have begun to renovate the space and expect to commence pre sale activities in late and to open the club in the last quarter of we delivered a million letter of credit to the landlord to secure our performance under the lease agreement 
based on preliminary estimates  we expect to spend approximately million to complete development of this club 
in april  we acquired rights to develop a sports club on the site of the former vertical club in new york city 
we issued a non interest bearing note for million to the seller of the club  and are required to pay principal in two equal installments in april and april based on preliminary estimates  we expect to spend approximately million to complete development of this club

based on preliminary estimates  we expect to spend approximately million to complete development of this club 
we are developing three spectrum clubs on leased sites in southern california which are expected to open in late and early based on preliminary estimates  we expect to spend approximately million to complete development of these clubs 
financing activities 
we currently have a million credit facility which will expire may  in march  we announced that we are privately offering million of senior secured notes the offering 
if the offering is consummated  our credit facility would be reduced to million and the maturity date would be extended to may  advances under our credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus or the lender s prime rate 
at december   the amount outstanding under our credit facility was approximately million which accrued interest at the weighted average rate of per annum 
the net proceeds of the offering would be used to repay approximately million of debt  to provide funds for future developments and for general corporate purposes 
debt would be repaid as follows dollars in millions o the sports club irvine note o the spectrum club agoura hills note o capital leases payable to millennium related to spectrum clubs in fullerton and santa ana o outstanding borrowing under our credit facility future capital requirements 
other than as described herein and for normal replacement of fitness equipment and remodeling of clubs  we have no commitments for capital expenditures

equipment financing has generally been available 
we had equipment financing of million outstanding at december  amounts borrowed pursuant to equipment financing arrangements are generally repayable in monthly installments over five years  with effective interest rates between and per annum 
while capital expenditures may fluctuate from time to time  generally we expect to spend approximately of revenues on facility and equipment upgrades and replacements 
in  we invested million in capital expenditures at existing clubs  which included million of major renovations at the five clubs we acquired in equipping new clubs requires expenditures above this level 
our long term capital needs are to provide funds for the developments described above  for additional development and acquisition projects and for general corporate purposes 
we estimate that the net proceeds of the offering  operating cash flows  and credit to be available under our credit facility and equipment financing would be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures in fiscal and on the projects currently under development 
acquiring and developing additional clubs will require additional capital 
if the offering is not consummated  we will require additional financing to complete development of the clubs described above 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available 
if such financing could not be obtained  we would have to delay or eliminate certain developments  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  if certain conditions are met  the terms of the offering and our credit facility may permit us to incur additional indebtedness 
we may also consider entering into joint venture and partnership agreements for the purpose of developing new clubs  subject to the terms of the offering and our credit facility 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the aicpa accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires that costs of start up activities  including organization costs and club openings  be expensed as incurred 
sop is applicable to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  restatement of previously issued financial statements is not permitted 
in the fiscal year for which sop is first adopted  the application should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we will adopt sop effective january   and  accordingly  will record a one time cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of related income taxes 
the amount of this charge is currently expected to be approximately million 
year readiness until recently  computer programs were written to store only two digits of date related information in order to more efficiently handle and store data  and thus are unable to distinguish between the year and the year this problem is frequently referred to as the year problem 
we have initiated a year project to bring all of our information technology it systems and non it systems into year compliance 
utilizing internal resources  we are in the process of defining  assessing and converting  or replacing  various programs  hardware and instrumentation systems to make them year compliant 
our it systems include our computer equipment and software relating to membership  financial accounting and sales of products and services 
non it systems include our communications systems  alarm and security systems  elevators and fitness equipment 
our year project focuses on three it component systems as well as non it systems 
membership systems 
the software programs we currently use to store membership and fee collection data and to process eft and credit card transactions are not year compliant 
we are installing a new system which is year compliant  which we expect to be in service at the sports club la and several other clubs during the fourth quarter of  and to be in service in all clubs by the end of the first quarter of the year because we do not anticipate installing the new membership system in all clubs prior to the year  we are also modifying our current membership systems to be year compliant 
we expect these modified systems to be operational during the third quarter of financial accounting systems 
the supplier of the installed version of our financial accounting system has orally represented to us that the system is year compliant 
in addition  we are purchasing a newer version of this system which we expect to have in place by the end of the second quarter of this newer version is certified in writing to be year compliant 
other it systems 
we are currently reviewing all other it systems for year compliance 
our food and beverage  sports boutique sales  private training and most other services and products systems are not year compliant  but we expect to replace or modify these systems to be year compliant during the third quarter of non it systems 
we have requested vendors of our non it systems to advise us if such systems are year compliant where we believe such assurance to be necessary 
we have received such assurances from vendors of certain systems  such as elevators  and we do not believe that the failure of other non it systems would have a material impact on us 
we believe that we will be able to replace or modify all significant non it systems which are not year compliant by december expense of year project 
we currently estimate that we will expend approximately million to acquire new hardware and other equipment  acquire new membership software  upgrade our existing membership software  update our financial accounting software and make the other modifications to our it systems described above 
most of these expenses would be incurred in order to upgrade our membership and accounting systems in the ordinary course of business 
of this amount   has been expended to date 
this expenditure will include new hardware and other equipment and software programs 
we have not determined what amounts we will expend to replace non it systems  but we do not expect such costs to be material 
third party systems 
we believe that the only third parties whose year problems could have a material effect on us are financial institutions that process our eft and credit card transactions 
we believe that these institutions have completed  or will complete prior to year  modifications to their systems to insure year compliance  however  we are unable to test third party systems 
risks of year problems 
the failure to correct a material year problem could interrupt our normal business activities or operations 
we believe that failures in our membership  financial accounting and food and beverage systems  or performance by third parties with respect to eft and credit card transactions  could materially and adversely affect us 
while we intend to test systems supplied by third parties  such testing may not reveal all year problems 
with the exception of certain critical non it systems which we have been assured are year compliant  we do not believe that a failure of other systems would have a material impact on us 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the performance of systems represented to us by vendors to be year compliant  we are unable to determine at this time whether year failures will have a material impact on us 
although our year project is not expected to significantly reduce our level of uncertainty about year problems  including the year readiness of third parties  we believe that completion of the year project will reduce the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations 
a contingency plan has not yet been developed for dealing with an interruption of a critical system 
we plan to develop and implement such a plan by the fourth quarter of the costs of our year project and the dates on which we believe we will complete the various phases of our year project are based upon our management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer code and imbedded technology  performance of new systems and equipment  the reduction of productivity pending completion of employee training  the need to remediate problems caused by failures in year compliance by third parties  and similar uncertainties
