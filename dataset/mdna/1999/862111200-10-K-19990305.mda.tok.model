revenue increased in  compared to  primarily due to increases in revenue from storage services and storage management software 
revenue from storage products increased slightly in as compared to gross profit margins increased to in as compared to in  primarily due to increased sales of higher margin storage management software 
the increased margins from storage management software were partially offset by decreased margins from storage services 
net income decreased in compared to  due to an increase in the effective tax rate 
revenue increased in compared to  due to revenue increases in all segments of the company s business 
revenue during was reduced by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements  particularly in europe 
gross profit margins increased to in as compared to in  primarily due to increased margins associated with storage products and storage management software 
this increase in margins was partially offset by decreased margins from storage services 
the company s future revenue and operating results are significantly dependent upon effectively managing the introduction of new products and services  developing new applications for its products  the successful development of new distribution channels  the successful implementation of the new storage area network san strategy  and managing operating expenses 
for the discussion of these and other risk factors  see risk factors that may affect future results below 
the company s cash and short term investments balances decreased million during due primarily to cash payments of million associated with the company s common stock repurchase programs and net investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
these payments were partially funded by net borrowings under the company s credit facilities of million  cash generated from operating activities of million  and a reduction of short term investments of million 
cash generated from operating activities decreased to million in  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased cash paid to suppliers and employees 
the increased cash paid to suppliers and employees was primarily a result of cash paid for additional inventory on hand at december   for new product ramp up  and cash payments in to reduce accrued liabilities outstanding at december  the accrued liabilities at december   were higher than at december   primarily as a result of employee bonus and profit sharing  and restructuring accruals 
the company s cash balances decreased million during net cash flows generated from operations in of million were more than offset by the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock at a cost of million  investments in property  plant and equipment of million and an increase in short term investments of million

revenue generated from storage products increased in  as compared to  and in  as compared to these increases are primarily due to increases in revenue from disk products 
tape products tape product revenue increased in  as compared to revenue from timberwolf tm  a family of automated tape libraries designed for the client server market  and powderhorn r  an automated cartridge system library  increased in  as compared to  but was offset by decreased revenue from timberline r  a track cartridge subsystem  and earlier generation tape products 
the decrease in timberline revenue is primarily the result of an increase in pricing pressure and delays during the second half of in customer purchase decisions associated with the evaluation of the company s new  a high performance tape drive 
the tape drive became generally available and provided initial revenue contribution in december tape product revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from timberwolf and redwood r sd  a high capacity cartridge subsystem 
this increase was offset by decreased revenue from earlier generation tape products  timberline  and powderhorn 
the decrease in timberline revenue was primarily a result of an increase in pricing pressure 
tape product revenue was unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements during disk products disk product revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from the openstorage tm disk subsystem  a family of disk products for the client server market 
while unit sales of the iceberg r disk storage product for the mainframe market increased in as compared to  the revenue remained unchanged due to price decreases provided for under the terms of an oem agreement with ibm 
a significant portion of the company s total revenue in was derived from sales of disk products to ibm 
see risk factors that may affect future results dependence on ibm  for discussion of the risks associated with ibm 
disk product revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from disk products sold to ibm under the oem agreement  and openstorage disk subsystems 
network products network product revenue decreased in  as compared to  and decreased in as compared to the decreases are primarily due to reduced revenue from the earlier generation connectivity products 
future revenue growth in the company s storage products is significantly dependent upon increased manufacturing volumes for the new tape drive  developing new business solution applications for storage products  developing new products and distribution channels for the client server disk market  increasing the direct sales of iceberg  and successfully implementing the san strategy 
see risk factors that may affect future results new products  markets and distribution channels  for discussion of the risks associated with the manufacture of new products 
storage services storage services include support service revenue from the company s and third party storage products  as well as integration service revenue associated with new applications  it business consulting and technology services revenue 
storage services revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in storage products under maintenance contracts and growth in the multi vendor support services area 
storage services revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in consulting services revenue 
the revenue from product maintenance was relatively unchanged in as compared to future revenue growth from storage services is significantly dependent on the company s initiative to drive consulting services as part of a packaged solution with products and software to address customer information storage requirements 
storage services revenue is also dependent on the company s continued success in capturing the maintenance business for its products as the indirect sales channel expands and the company focuses on the client server market 
storage management software storage management software revenue increased in as compared to  primarily due to increased revenue from snapshot tm  software designed for use with the company s iceberg product  and virtual storage manager vsm  a software driven data storage management solution designed to improve performance  cartridge utilization  and overall storage management 
the increase in snapshot revenue was primarily due to increased oem sales to ibm 
vsm became available and brought initial revenue contribution in december storage management software revenue increased in  as compared to  primarily due to increased sales of snapshot 
future revenue growth from storage management software is significantly dependent upon gaining market acceptance for vsm 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in gaining market acceptance for vsm 
in addition  the company must develop new distribution channels for snapshot  which is currently distributed primarily by ibm under an oem agreement 
see risk factors that may affect future results dependence on ibm  for discussion of the risks associated with ibm 
gross profit gross profit margins increased to in  as compared to in  primarily due to the increased sales of higher margin storage management software and improved efficiencies associated with the manufacture of storage products 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by reduced margins associated with storage services 
the decrease in storage service margins is due primarily to increased pricing pressures associated with maintenance of storage products in the client server market and reduced margins associated with the company s consulting services 
gross profit margins increased to in  as compared to in  primarily due to increased manufacturing volumes and improved manufacturing efficiencies associated with storage products  and increased sales of higher margin storage management software 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in gross margins associated with storage services 
the decrease in storage services gross margins reflects the reduced margins associated with the company s consulting services 
gross margins in  as compared to  also benefited from a change in the classification of advanced manufacturing costs of approximately million  which are included within research and product development costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
the markets for most of the company s products and services are subject to intense price competition 
in addition to the price competition in the markets  the company is subject to scheduled price reductions under the terms of the oem agreement with ibm 
the company anticipates that price competition for its products will continue to be a major factor 
gross margin as a percent of revenue is expected to be impacted as the company increases its market presence in the lower margin client server market and as a result of incremental start up costs associated with the new products introduced in the fourth quarter of the company s ability to sustain or improve gross margins is significantly dependent upon its ability to continue to reduce manufacturing costs and to continue to increase sales of higher margin storage management software 
storage product and storage management software gross margins may be affected in future periods by inventory reserves and writedowns resulting from rapid technological changes and delays in gaining market acceptance for new products 
storage services margins may be adversely affected in the future as a result of increased competition and lower margins associated with the company s consulting services 
research and product development research and product development expenditures increased in  as compared to the increased investment in new development activities during was partially offset by the receipt of approximately million of research and product development funding from third parties 
research and product development expenditures increased in  as compared to research and product development costs for  as compared to  include incremental costs of approximately million associated with a change in the classification of costs associated with certain advanced manufacturing activities that were previously included within cost of revenue 
increased investments during in developing new products were offset by the receipt of approximately million of research and product development funding from third parties 
the company s research and development costs are expected to continue to increase in as a result of the significant product development activities currently under way and an anticipated decline in the level of funding received from third parties in  as compared to the company anticipates that the expected increase in research and product development expense as a result of the decreased funding  will be partially offset due to reduced spending as the company is consolidating various research and product development efforts 
selling  general  administrative and other selling  general  administrative and other income and expense sg a increased in  as compared to the increase is primarily because of spending on internal business and financial information systems  selling expenses associated with the company s storage product sales and branding initiatives 
the increase was partially offset by reduced accruals for employee bonus and profit sharing payments in  as compared to  as the company did not attain certain financial goals in sg a increased in  as compared to  primarily because of spending on internal business and financial information systems  employee profit sharing and bonus expenses associated with increased earnings levels  and selling expenses associated with the company s storage product sales initiatives 
sg a during also includes gains realized on the sale of accounts receivable of million in gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions and translation adjustments  net of associated hedging results  are included in sg a and aggregated a net loss of million for  compared to a net gain of million in and a net loss of million in see international operations and market risk management foreign currency exchange risk  for further discussion of the foreign exchange risks associated with the company s international operations and the related foreign currency hedging activities 
interest income and expense interest income decreased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in cash available for investment 
interest expense increased in  as compared to  due to borrowing under the company s unsecured credit facilities 
see liquidity and capital resources available financing lines  for further discussion of the company s credit facilities 
interest income increased in  as compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in cash available for investment 
interest expense decreased in  as compared to  as the company redeemed all of its outstanding convertible debentures 
income taxes the company utilized substantially all of its remaining united states net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards during  which resulted in an increase in the company s effective tax rate from in  to in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be recognized to the extent realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the currently available information  management has determined that the company will more likely than not realize million of deferred income tax assets as of december  the company s valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   relates principally to net deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards associated with the company s foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources working capital the company s cash and short term investments balances decreased million during due primarily to cash payments of million associated with the company s common stock repurchase programs and net investments in property  plant and equipment of million 
these payments were partially funded by net borrowings under the company s credit facilities of million  cash generated from operating activities of million  and a reduction of short term investments of million 
cash generated from operating activities decreased to million in  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased cash paid to suppliers and employees 
the increased cash paid to suppliers and employees was primarily a result of cash paid for additional inventory on hand at december   for new product ramp up  and cash payments in to reduce accrued liabilities outstanding at december  the accrued liabilities at december   were higher than at december   primarily as a result of employee bonus and profit sharing  and restructuring accruals 
the company s cash balances decreased million from december   to december  cash generated from operations of million during was more than offset by the cash used to repurchase million of the company s common stock at a cost of million 
net purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and an increase in short term investments of million also contributed to the decrease in cash balances during available financing lines the company has a million unsecured revolving credit facility the million revolver which expires in october the credit limit available under the million revolver will be reduced by million on the last day of each calendar quarter with the first reduction beginning december  the interest rates under the million revolver depend on the type of advance selected 
the basic advance rate is not less than the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
approximately as of december  
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the million revolver as of december   has varied from approximately to 
as of december   the company had borrowings of million and had issued letters of credit for approximately  under the million revolver 
the remaining available credit under the million revolver as of december   was approximately million 
the million revolver contains certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the company s payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank that provides for the sale of promissory notes in the principal amount of up to million at any one time 
the agreement  which expires in january  provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as of december   the company had outstanding borrowings of million and had committed to borrowings between january and december in the cumulative principal amount of approximately million 
the notes must be repaid only to the extent of future revenue and obligations under the agreement are not cancelable by the company or the bank 
gains and losses associated with changes in the underlying foreign currencies are deferred during the commitment period and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment at the time the bank purchases the promissory notes 
the promissory notes  together with accrued interest  are payable in us dollars within days from the date of issuance and bear interest at rates no less than the libor plus approximately as of december  
under the terms of the agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants and  under certain circumstances  may be required to maintain a collateral account  including cash and qualifying investments  in an amount not less than the outstanding promissory notes 
in january  the company entered into an additional million unsecured revolving credit facility the million revolver which expires in january the interest rates under the million revolver depend on the type of advance selected 
the basic advance rate is not less than the libor plus 
the million revolver contains certain financial and other covenants  including restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on the company s common stock 
the company intends to continue to commit substantial working capital to research and product development projects  and the rollout of new products and services 
the company may invest in or acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies as market and business conditions warrant 
the company believes it has adequate working capital and financing capabilities to meet its anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next months 
over the longer term  the company may choose to fund these activities through the issuance of additional equity or debt financing 
the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  can be completed on terms acceptable to the company 
total debt to total capitalization the company s total debt to capitalization ratio increased from as of december   to as of december   primarily due to short term borrowings of million under the company s credit facilities  coupled with a decrease in stockholders equity as a result of the company s common stock repurchases 
see liquidity and capital resources working capital and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s common stock repurchase programs 
international operations during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s revenue was generated by its international operations 
the decrease in international revenue during is principally because of a shift in sales of iceberg and snapshot from the company s worldwide direct sales channel to oem sales to ibm in the united states 
the company also sells other products and software through domestic indirect distribution channels that have end user customers located outside the united states 
the company expects that it will continue to generate a significant portion of its revenue from international operations in the future 
the majority of the company s international operations involve transactions denominated in the local currencies of countries within western europe  principally germany  france and the united kingdom  japan  canada and australia 
an increase in the exchange value of the united states dollar reduces the value of revenue and profits generated by the company s international operations 
as a result  the company s operating and financial results can be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company employs a foreign currency hedging program 
see market risk management foreign currency exchange risk  below 
the company s international business may be affected by changes in demand resulting from global and localized economic and business conditions 
the company is subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states  including changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  tariffs  quotas  difficulty in obtaining export licenses  potentially adverse taxes  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and other factors outside the company s control 
there can be no assurances these factors will have no material adverse effect on the company s business or financial results in the future 
market risk management foreign currency exchange risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments relates primarily to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company seeks opportunities to reduce exposures through financing activities 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are also used to reduce foreign currency exposures 
all foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts are authorized and executed pursuant to the company s policies 
foreign currency options and forward exchange contracts that are designated as and qualify as hedging transactions are subject to hedge accounting treatment 
the company does not hold or issue derivatives or any other financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s financial instruments and off balance sheet risks 
the company has a financing agreement with a bank which provides for commitments by the bank to purchase promissory notes denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
gains and losses associated with changes in the underlying foreign currencies are deferred during the commitment period and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue supporting the note repayment at the time the bank purchases the promissory notes 
see available financing lines  for a description of the financing agreement 
the company periodically utilizes foreign currency options  generally with maturities of less than one year  to hedge a portion of its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with anticipated revenue from its international operations 
gains and losses associated with the options are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the underlying revenue transactions 
to the extent an option is terminated or ceases to be effective as a hedge  any gains and losses as of that date are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the underlying revenue transaction 
the company also utilizes forward exchange contracts  generally with maturities of less than two months  to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations associated with monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and anticipated revenues from its international operations 
the carrying amounts of these forward exchange contracts equal their fair value as the contracts are adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates 
gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities are recognized as incurred within sg a on the consolidated statement of operations as adjustments to the foreign exchange gains and losses on the translation of net monetary assets 
gains and losses on the forward contracts used to hedge anticipated revenues are recognized as incurred as adjustments to revenue 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates applied to the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments held as of december   and as of december   would result in a hypothetical loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in the hypothetical loss for is primarily due to an increase in committed borrowings under the financing agreement 
these hypothetical losses do not take into consideration the company s underlying international operations 
the company anticipates that any hypothetical loss associated with the company s foreign currency exchange rate sensitive instruments would be offset by gains associated with its underlying international operations 
the company had outstanding borrowings under its million revolver at december  the interest rate on these borrowings is dependent on the libor which is sensitive to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in the libor applied to the borrowings would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position in risk factors that may affect future results new products  markets and distribution channels the company s results of operations and competitive strength depend upon its ability to successfully develop  manufacture and market innovative new products and software 
short product life cycles are inherent to the high technology market 
the company must devote significant resources to research and product development projects and effectively manage the risks inherent in new product transitions 
developing new technology and products is complex and involves uncertainties 
delays in product development  manufacturing  or in customer purchasing decisions can make product transitions difficult 
in addition  product transitions make the process of production and inventory planning more difficult as the company must accurately anticipate product mix and configuration demands  and accurately forecast inventory levels 
the company has experienced product development delays in the past that adversely affected the company s financial results and competitive position 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully manage the development and introduction of new products and software in the future 
in december  the company s new tape drive and vsm software became available 
the company s financial results in are significantly dependent on increased manufacturing capacity and volumes for the tape drive and gaining market acceptance for vsm 
the manufacture of new products involves integrating complex designs and processes  and collaborating with suppliers of key components from a sole source supplier 
a design flaw or the failure to obtain sufficient quantities of key components could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results 
the company historically has generated a significant portion of its revenue and operating profits from the mainframe market 
while storage capacity in the mainframe market continues to increase  the rate of revenue growth has slowed as a result of significant price competition 
the company s future financial results are significantly dependent upon successfully competing in the rapidly growing client server and san markets 
the company currently is making significant investments in developing new products  services and software for these markets 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in these activities 
the company is increasing its reliance on indirect distribution channels  such as oems  value added resellers and value added distributors 
indirect channel activities make the company s production and inventory planning more complex 
the company s operating and financial results may be adversely affected in the event an indirect partner establishes a new relationship with a competitor  delays or changes its purchasing patterns  or experiences financial difficulties 
see dependence on ibm  below  for a discussion of issues associated with the company s distribution channels for its disk products 
dependence on ibm in  approximately of the company s total revenue was derived from sales of products and software to ibm 
the company currently anticipates that in  ibm will serve as the primary distribution channel for iceberg and snapshot 
under the worldwide  non exclusive oem agreement entered into during december  ibm is not subject to any long term volume purchase commitments 
however  ibm does receive volume purchase discounts 
because of the volume purchase discounts included in the oem agreement  the company must continue to reduce costs and expenses associated with manufacturing the products in order to achieve the expected benefits of the agreement 
the oem agreement with ibm includes certain indemnities by the company 
the company has received notice from ibm that it may seek indemnification from the company in the event of an adverse outcome of a pending patent infringement lawsuit 
in december  the company and ibm agreed to a settlement with the united states department of justice doj concerning the company s oem relationship with ibm 
the terms of the settlement are contained in a consent decree which was approved by the us district court for the district of columbia on march  under the terms of the consent decree  which expires in december  the company must develop complementary domestic distribution channels for delivery of certain disk products in or the company could be subject to limitations on its sales to ibm in the future 
the company s oem agreement with ibm expires in december ibm has indicated that it is currently developing a competitive disk product 
as a result  the company anticipates that ibm will reduce its purchasing patterns in the future and may not extend the relationship with respect to future products and software 
the company is currently ramping up its direct sales channel to drive increased sales of iceberg and snapshot during failure to develop new distribution channels for the company s disk products and software could adversely affect the company s financial results 
competition the markets for the company s products  software and services are intensely competitive and are subject to continuous  rapid technological change  frequent product performance improvements  short product life cycles and aggressive pricing 
the company believes that its ability to remain competitive includes factors such as price and cost of the company s and its competitors product offerings  the timing and success of new products and offerings  and new product introductions by the company s competitors 
this competitive environment gives rise to aggressive pricing strategies and puts pressure on the company s gross margins 
the company s competitors include  among others  compaq computer corporation  emc corporation  hewlett packard company  hitachi ltd  ibm  and sun microsystems  inc a number of the company s competitors have significantly greater market presence and financial resources than the company 
in the highly competitive client server market  a number of the company s competitors are able to offer customers a bundled server and storage product  which may provide them a competitive advantage 
the company expects to address some of these competitive issues through its san strategy  which is capable of operating in a range of environments 
the san market is characterized by various alliances formed to promote industry standards and deliver tested  interoperable san technology 
the company is a member of several associations  which also include the company s competitors 
in addition  a number of the company s competitors in the product  services and software markets have formed alliances with the stated objective of developing interoperable san solutions 
for example  com corporation  legato systems  inc and mti technology corporation have formed an alliance to deliver tested san solutions 
in the storage management software market  the company competes with vendors with which it has established partnerships  including that of legato systems  inc and veritas software corporation 
the company also anticipates that it will continue to establish distribution partnerships with other equipment manufacturers  software vendors and service providers to address competitive factors 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to successfully compete against other companies in these markets 
volatility of stock price  earnings fluctuations  restructuring the trading price of the company s common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the company s stock price may be impacted if the company s revenue or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broad economic and market trends  which are unrelated to the company s performance 
the company s financial and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of reasons 
in the past  the company s results have followed a seasonal pattern  which reflects the tendency of customers to make their purchase decisions at the end of a calendar year 
during any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large portion of total product sales are completed in the last weeks and days of the quarter 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently difficult 
the company plans its operating expenses on the expected revenue and a revenue shortfall may cause results to be below expectation in that period 
a shortfall in revenue could be caused by a number of factors  such as product and technology transitions announced by the company or its competitors  delays in the availability of new products  changes in the purchasing patterns of the company s customers and distribution partners  the timing of customers acceptance of certain solutions  rapid price erosion  or global economic conditions 
the company operates in the high technology market which is inherently susceptible to rapid changes in customer demand  technological advances  and intense competition 
in order to address these factors  the company has restructured its business in the past in order to re align its business with the market or establish a more cost efficient business structure 
these restructurings have resulted in expenses which have adversely affected reported results of operations in the period the restructuring plan was adopted 
there can be no assurance that changes in the company s business or in its industry will not necessitate restructuring charges in the future 
sole source suppliers the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products and believes that  in most cases  there are a number of alternative  competent vendors for most of those parts and components 
many non standard parts are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  however  there are other vendors who could produce these in satisfactory quantities after a period of pre qualification and product ramping 
certain of the company s key components and products are purchased from single suppliers that the company believes are currently the only manufacturers of the particular components that meet the company s qualification requirements and other specifications or for which alternative sources of supply are not readily available 
in particular  imation corporation is a single source supplier for the tape cartridges  and the company is dependent upon sumitomo corporation for materials used in the company s tape drive recording heads 
the company is also dependent on ibm for disk drives used in the company s iceberg product which are sold to ibm under an oem agreement and which the company sells through its own direct sales channel 
certain of the company s suppliers have experienced occasional technical  financial or other problems in the past that have delayed deliveries  but without significant effect on the company 
an unanticipated failure of any sole source supplier to meet the company s requirements for an extended period  or the inability to secure comparable components in a timely manner  could result in a shortage of key components  longer lead times  and reduced control over production and delivery schedules 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue and operating results 
in the event a sole source supplier was unable or unwilling to continue to supply components  the company would have to identify and qualify other acceptable suppliers 
this process could take an extended period  and no assurance can be given that any additional source would become available or would be able to satisfy the company s production requirements on a timely basis 
information systems transition the company is in the process of replacing many of its internal information systems with new  integrated information systems that are complex and that will affect numerous operational  transactional  financial and reporting processes 
the transition to these new systems and processes is currently expected to be completed during the third quarter of  and involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company must successfully manage the transfer of critical information to the new systems  the integration of these systems  and the implementation of associated process changes and employee training programs 
the company intends to conduct extensive tests on these new systems and processes prior to implementation  however  these tests may not be able to fully simulate the transition phase and day to day operating environment 
there can be no assurance that the transition to the new information systems will cause no interruptions in the company s critical business processes 
failure to successfully manage the transition could adversely affect the company s operating and financial results 
risks associated with the year the company s product lines include information storage products and software which collect  move  store  share  and protect data 
in order to properly process data  the company s products must successfully manage and manipulate data that includes both th and st century dates year ready 
the company has evaluated all of its currently offered products and software and believes that they are year ready  provided they have been upgraded to include all recommended engineering changes 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s current products and software will be year ready in all environments 
in addition  the company does not currently intend to develop modifications to certain of its older products and software to make them year ready and is in the process of notifying the affected maintenance customers of potential year problems with older products and software in order to raise their awareness 
the company generally believes that it is not legally responsible for costs incurred by its customers to achieve their year readiness 
should the company s products and software fail to be year ready  however  the company may experience increased warranty and other customer satisfaction costs 
since the year complications are not fully known and potential liability issues are uncertain  the effect of the year on the company s warranty costs and financial results are not known at this time  but could be material in any given quarter 
the company is currently in the process of replacing many of its internal information systems with new integrated information systems 
see information systems transition above 
these new systems are believed to be year ready 
the company has also completed its assessment on its other critical internal information systems which are not being replaced and has implemented remediation programs on non year ready systems 
the company has substantially completed assessing critical non information systems to determine if they are year ready 
the remediation programs for its information and non information systems that are not year ready are expected to be substantially completed and tested by june the company is currently formulating contingency plans in the event of a system failure or delay 
the costs incurred to date directly related to the company s remediation activities total approximately million 
future costs related to the remediation activities are not expected to exceed approximately million  however  the amount may change as the year activities progress during these remediation costs do not include the costs associated with the company s new information systems  which are expected to be year ready 
the company has invested approximately million in these new information systems as of december   and the investment in these systems in is estimated to be approximately million 
while the company has not yet completed its year remediation and testing activities on all of its information and non information systems  the company does not currently believe that these activities will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and financial results 
delays in implementing new internal information systems or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems could have material adverse consequences  including delays in the delivery or sale of the company s products  or cause the company to incur unexpected additional costs 
the company also has implemented a program to assess the possible effects on its operations of the year readiness of key suppliers and vendors and is in the process of receiving information concerning the suppliers and vendors year ready status 
the company s dependence on suppliers and vendors and  therefore  on the proper functioning of their information systems and software  means that their failure to address year issues could have a material effect on the company s operations and financial results 
the company anticipates completing its assessment by the end of the first quarter of based on the results of the assessment  the company may identify alternative suppliers and vendors 
the effect that the year will have on customers information technology spending patterns is uncertain at this time 
the potential adverse consequences resulting from customers year concerns could include  among others  decreased spending on new information storage systems during as customers complete their year testing activities and delays in customer purchase decisions once customers have verified the year readiness of their information systems 
the demand for the company s products worldwide could be adversely affected in the event these patterns were to materialize  which could have an adverse effect on the company s operating and financial results

like many companies that operate in europe  various aspects of the company s business and financial accounting will be affected by the euro conversion and the transitions in the business environment resulting from the convergence of currencies 
the company continues to evaluate the european pricing strategies for its products and services and the implications of the euro conversion on its contractual agreements  tax strategy and foreign currency risk management strategy 
the company does not believe that the transition in the european market resulting from the euro conversion will impact the competitiveness of its products and services in europe in the short term  as significant price transparency already exists 
there can be no assurances  however  that the conversion will not adversely affect the company s pricing  tax  and currency hedging strategies  or business systems and processes in the future
