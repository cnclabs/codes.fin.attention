liquidity and capital resources charter municipal mortgage acceptance company the company is a delaware business trust which is engaged in the acquisition and ownership either directly or indirectly of tax exempt participating and non participating first mortgage bonds fmbs issued by various state or local governments or other agencies or authorities and secured by participating and non participating mortgage loans on the underlying properties

in order to generate increased tax exempt income and as a result enhance the value of the company s shares  the company intends to originate and acquire additional tax exempt bonds secured by multifamily properties 
the company believes that it can earn above market rates of interest on its bond acquisitions by focusing its efforts primarily on affordable housing 
the manager estimates that nearly of all new multifamily development contains an affordable component which produces tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the company has designed a direct purchase program specifically designed to appeal to developers of such properties 
in general  these properties are smaller than traditional multifamily housing properties  averaging units 
the traditional method of financing tax exempt properties requires the involvement of credit enhancement  rating agencies and investment bankers 
therefore  the up front cost of such financing is generally much higher than traditional multifamily financing 
through its direct purchase program  the company will originate and acquire tax exempt bonds without the cost associated with credit enhancement  rating agencies and investment bankers 
the company believes that the up front cost savings to the developer will translate into a higher than market interest rate on the bonds acquired by the company 
the company is positioned to market its direct purchase program as a result of the manager s affiliation with related 
related and its predecessor companies have specialized in offering debt and equity products to mid market multifamily owners and developers for over years 
related has provided debt and equity financing to properties valued at over billion 
in addition  since related has been one of the nation s leading provider of equity to developers of multifamily housing which benefits from tax credits 
during  the manager s affiliation with related allowed it to become one of the dominant lenders to developers and owners of affordable housing financed with tax exempt bonds 
the company does not operate as a mortgage reit  which generally utilize high levels of leverage and acquire subordinated interests in commercial and or residential mortgage backed securities 
rather  the company utilizes low levels of leverage and generally originates and acquires long term  fixed rate  tax exempt fmbs 
as a result  the company did not experience the ill effects associated with the volatile interest rate environment during pursuant to its trust agreement  the company is only able to incur leverage or other financing up to of the company s total market value as defined in the trust agreement as of the date incurred the limit 
the company expects to seek shareholder approval at the annual meeting to amend the trust agreement to permit the company to exceed the limit with respect to short term borrowings of no more than approximately of total market value 
mortgage reits typically incur leverage at ratios ranging from between to in general  the fmbs that the company either originates or acquires call for ten year restrictions from prepayments  eliminating the company s susceptibility to significant levels of repayment risk as a result of interest rate reductions 
consistent with the foregoing  the company focuses on providing investors with a stable level of distributions  even through unstable markets 
due to the company s low level of leverage  the company has not been affected by the recent lack of liquidity that is currently impairing mortgage reits and its portfolio does not contain assets that are especially vulnerable to volatility during periods of interest rate fluctuations 
on may   the company closed on its private label tender option program top in order to raise additional capital of million to acquire additional fmbs 
during  the company contributed issues of fmbs in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  to a delaware business trust the origination trust  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which then contributed of those fmbs  with an aggregate principal amount of approximately  to another delaware business trust the owner trust 
the owner trust issued two equity certificates i a senior certificate  with an outstanding face amount of  at december   which has been deposited into another delaware business trust the certificate trust which issued and sold floater certificates representing proportional interests in the senior certificate to new investors  and ii a residual certificate representing the remaining beneficial ownership interest in the owner trust  which has been issued to the origination trust  whose sole owner is the company 
in addition  the owner trust obtained a municipal bond insurance policy from mbia to credit enhance certificate distributions for the benefit of the holders of the floater certificates and has also arranged for a liquidity facility  issued by a consortium of highly rated european banks  with respect to the floater certificates 
the end result of these transactions is that a portion of the interest received by the owner trust on the fmbs it holds is distributed through the senior certificate to the holders of the floater certificates in an amount determined each week by the remarketing agent  goldman sachs co  at the distribution amount that is required to enable the remarketing agent to sell the floater certificates at par on any weekly determination date 
currently  the maximum amount of floater certificates that can be issued to raise capital under the top is million and as of december   such maximum has been issued 
the company is currently negotiating an increase in its top to million and  before the end of  the company expects to raise funds through an equity offering  however  there can be no assurance that either of these initiatives will be successful 
if the company is unable to access additional capital through the foregoing initiatives  the company s ability to grow will be restricted 
the company s cost of funds relating to the top calculated as income allocated to the minority interest plus current fees as a percentage of the weighted average amount of the outstanding senior certificate was approximately for the period may  inception through december  during  an interim credit facility with goldman sachs company the interim credit facility was available to the company at prevailing rates of interest for such accounts at december  
at december  there were no borrowings outstanding 
the company is currently negotiating with goldman sachs company and various other lenders the renewal or replacement of this facility 
during the period january  through march  the company acquired fmbs for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  not including bond selection fees and expenses of approximately  the purchases were financed by the top and from borrowings under the interim credit facility 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents of the company and its consolidated subsidiary increased approximately  this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities  the net sale of temporary investments  principal payments received from loans made to properties  and an increase in minority interest  which exceeded the purchase of fmbs  an increase in deferred bond selection costs  loans made to properties  net repayments of note payable  an increase in deferred costs relating to the top  and distributions paid 
included in the adjustments to reconcile the net income to cash provided by operating activities is amortization in the amount of  the company s growth will be financed by the top or similar programs  borrowings under the interim credit facility  funds generated from operations in excess of distributions and by placements of equity 
the company has entered into forbearance agreements on several fmbs and may be required to extend these agreements or enter into new agreements in the future 
such agreements may adversely impact liquidity  however interest payments from fmbs are anticipated to provide sufficient liquidity to fund the company s operating expenditures  debt service and distributions in future years 
effective january   the highland ridge  willow creek  bristol village and thomas lake fmbs were modified to i reflect a change in their stated interest rates  ii allow for deferred base and other interest accrued and unpaid through december to be paid at maturity or upon an event of sale or refinancing and iii extend the mandatory call and prepayment lock out dates 
in addition  the maturities of the highland ridge and willow creek fmbs were extended to and  respectively  and the maturities of the bristol village and thomas lake fmbs were extended to with mandatory call dates at january on december   the mansion fmb was modified to i reflect a change in base interest rate  effective december  from to  ii allow for certain equal quarterly payments of supplemental contingent interest  per quarter to be paid initially at closing and then quarterly over the second  third and fourth quarters of and iii extend the maturity date  the mandatory call date and the prepayment lock out dates to  and  respectively 
pursuant to the modified terms of the mansion fmb  no additional contingent interest is to be paid from this fmb 
the company currently anticipates that it will modify certain other fmbs in generally similar terms as mansion and those done previously and effective in  where and as appropriate 
as part of the settlement of class action litigation relating to the partnerships  counsel class counsel for the partners of the partnerships had the right to petition the united states district court for the southern district of new york the court for additional attorneys fees counsel s fee shares in an amount to be determined in the court s sole discretion

general the determination as to whether it is in the best interest of the company to enter into forbearance agreements on the fmbs or  alternatively  to pursue its remedies under the loan documents  including foreclosure  is based upon several factors including  but not limited to  underlying property performance  owner cooperation and projected legal costs 
the difference between the stated interest rates and the rates paid by fmbs is not accrued as interest income for financial reporting purposes 
the accrual of interest at the stated interest rate will resume once an underlying property s ability to pay the stated rate has been adequately demonstrated 
interest income of approximately   and  was not recognized for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash available for distribution the company uses cash available for distribution cad as the primary measure of its dividend paying ability 
the difference between cad and net income results from variations between generally accepted accounting principles gaap and cash received 
one difference between cad and gaap is the amortization of loan origination costs  the costs of the top and other intangible assets 
these amounts have been excluded from cad due to their noncash nature 
another difference is the noncash gain and loss associated with bond impairments and sales for gaap purposes  which are not included in the calculation of cad 
during the year ended december  and the three months ended december   there were fmb impairments in the amounts of and  respectively 
cad should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
cash available for distribution cad for the year ended december  and the three months ended december  is summarized in the following table year ended three months ended december  december  sources of cash interest income first mortgage bonds   temporary investments   promissory notes   less accretion of amounts included in income   total sources of cash   uses of cash total expenses and minority interest   less amortization of amounts included in expenses   loss on impairment of assets  total uses of cash   cash available for distribution   less distributions to the manager   cash available for distribution to shareholders   distributions to shareholders   payout ratio cash flows from operating activities   investing activities   financing activities   recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities

forward looking statements certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements include statements regarding the intent  belief or current expectations of the company and its management and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

year compliance the company utilizes the computer services of an affiliate of the manager 
the affiliate of the manager has upgraded its computer information systems to be year compliant and beyond 
the year compliance issue concerns the inability of a computerized system to accurately record dates after the affiliate of the manager recently underwent a conversion of its financial systems applications and upgraded all of its non compliant  in house software and hardware inventory 
the work stations that experienced problems from the testing process were corrected with an upgrade patch 
the costs incurred by the manager are not being charged to the company 
the most likely worst case scenario that the company faces is that computer operations will be suspended for a few days to a week at january  the company s contingency plan is to have a complete backup done on december  and to have both electronic and printed reports generated for all critical data up to and including december with regard to third parties  the company s manager is in the process of evaluating the potential adverse impact that could result from the failure of material service providers to be year compliant 
a detailed survey and assessment was sent to material third parties in the fourth quarter of the company has received assurances from a majority of its third parties with which it interacts that they have addressed the year issues and is evaluating these assurances for their adequacy and accuracy 
in cases where the company has not received assurances from third parties  it is initiating further mail and or phone correspondence 
the company relies heavily on third parties and is vulnerable to the failures of third parties to address their year issues 
there can be no assurance given that the third parties will adequately address their issues 
inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the nature of the company s investments and the instruments used to raise capital for their acquisition expose the company to gains and losses due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental policies  domestic and international political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
the fmbs generally bear interest at fixed rates  or pay interest according to the cash flows of the underlying property  which do not fluctuate with changes in market interest rates 
in contrast  payments required under the top program vary based on market interest rates  primarily bma  and are re set weekly 
thus  an increase in market interest rates would result in increased payments under the top program  without a corresponding increase in cash flows from the investments in fmbs 
for example  based on the  outstanding under the top program at december   the company estimates that an increase of in the bma rate would decrease the company s annual net income by approximately  a increase in bma would decrease annual net income by approximately  for the same reasons  a decrease in market interest rates would generally benefit the company  as a result of decreased allocations to the minority interest without corresponding decreases in interest received on the fmbs 
for example  based on the  outstanding under the top program at december   the company estimates that a decline in bma rates would increase the company s annual net income by approximately  and a decline in bma would increase net income by approximately  various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
although management has not engaged in any of these hedging strategies in the past  it may do so in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
changes in market interest rates would also impact the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio of fmbs 
the company estimates the fair value for each bond as the present value of its expected cash flows  using a discount rate for comparable tax exempt investments 
therefore  as market interest rates for tax exempt investments increase  the estimated fair value of the company s fmbs will generally decline  and a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in an increase in the estimated fair values 
for example  the company projects that a increase in market rates for tax exempt investments would decrease the estimated fair value of its portfolio of fmbs from its december  value of  to approximately  a decline in interest rates would increase the value of the december  portfolio to approximately  changes in the estimated fair value of the fmbs do not impact the company s reported net income  earnings per share  distributions or cash flows  but are reported as components of other comprehensive income and affect reported shareholders equity
