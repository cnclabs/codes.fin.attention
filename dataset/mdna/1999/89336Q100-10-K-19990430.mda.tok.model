most of the company s capital expenditures are for new store expansion and the relocation of existing stores 
the company typically finances its capital expenditures through internally generated cash and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company may receive financing from landlords in the form of construction allowances or rent concessions for a portion of the capital expenditure

the system was rolled out to all stores during the second quarter of fiscal the remaining expenditures were related to new stores and store remodels and reconfigurations 
in  the company plans to spend approximately million  net of construction allowances  for additions to fixed assets 
provision for business restructuring 
the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in to reflect the anticipated costs associated with a program to close stores 
the restructuring charge included the write down of fixed assets  estimated cash payments to landlords for the early termination of operating leases  inventory related costs including the cost for returning all remaining merchandise after the store was closed  and employee termination benefits 
the charge also included estimated professional fees related to the development of the store closing plan and the negotiations with landlords related to the termination of leases  a provision for exiting the rental video store format  the write off of goodwill related to a previous acquisition and a provision for closing the company s fixture manufacturing operation 
inventory related costs have been included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
an analysis of the amounts comprising the restructuring charge and the charges against the related reserve for each year in the four year period ended january  are outlined below charges balance charges balance charges balance charges against as of against as of against as of against remaining reserve reserve reserve reserve reserve reserve balance reversal in thousands leasehold improvements   furniture and fixtures   video rental assets       goodwill non cash write offs        lease obligations         inventory related costs      termination benefits professional fees    other costs  cash outflows          total           the company completed the restructuring program in  resulting in the closure of stores versus an original plan of stores 
the remaining balance in the store closing reserve of million was credited to operations in the th quarter of in determining the components of the reserve  management analyzed all aspects of the restructuring plan and the costs that would be incurred 
the write off of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures represented the estimated net book value of these items at the forecasted closing date 
in determining the provision for lease obligations  the company considered the amount of time remaining on each store s lease and estimated the amount necessary for either buying out the lease or continued rent payments subsequent to store closure 
inventory related costs include the cost to pack and ship the inventory on hand after the closing of the store as well as the penalty paid to the vendor for additional merchandise returns resulting from the restructuring 
termination benefits represented the severance payments expected to be made to terminated employees 
professional fees represented amounts expected to be paid to advisors related to the development of the store closing plan and the negotiations with landlords related to the termination of leases 
payments to lenders for the waiver of covenant violations totaling million were included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
the cash outflows for the restructuring was financed from operating cash flows and the liquidation of merchandise inventory from the closed stores

sales related to stores that were closed as part of the restructuring program were million  million and million in  and  respectively  in the year of closure 
store operating losses  excluding corporate allocations  related to stores that were closed were   and  in  and  respectively 
the provision for termination benefits was based on the expectation that employees would be terminated in connection with the restructuring program 
through january   employees had been terminated 
the company did not terminate as many employees as originally planned because higher than normal levels of attrition occurring after the announcement of the restructuring resulted in a reduced need for involuntary terminations 
subsequent to the adoption of the restructuring program  improving economic conditions in certain markets  improvement in individual store performance and the inability to negotiate reasonable lease termination agreements have led the company to keep open certain stores that were originally expected to be closed 
the company also decided not to close its fixture manufacturing operation 
during  a total of stores were removed from the list of stores expected to be closed 
conversely  deteriorating economic conditions and store performance in certain markets have led the company to close certain stores that were not originally expected to be closed 
during  no stores were added to the list of stores to be closed 
in addition  the timing of store closures has also been affected by the ability or inability to negotiate reasonable lease termination agreements 
the net effect of changes made to the timing of store closures and the stores to be closed under the restructuring program has not been material 
the restructuring program was completed january   and the remaining balance of million in the store closing reserve was credited to operations

the company s business is highly seasonal  with the highest sales and earnings occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for quarterly financial highlights 
year compliance 
the company has completed an assessment of the business risks related to the year issue 
the results of the assessment indicated that awareness of year issues is well known throughout the company  the assessment of year sensitive items is complete  a list of items and business relationships sensitive to the year issue has been compiled  renovation of the core information technology it systems has been completed  third party compliance tracking has begun  and verification of embedded chip non it system readiness for year compliance is ready to begin 
the company s year issue remediation process includes the following phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
as indicated above  the awareness  assessment and renovation phases are complete 
the awareness phase included establishing an internal year committee  interviewing key company personnel at all levels  including those at the stores  distribution center and home office  and vendor compliance tracking 
activities in the assessment phase included contacting merchandise vendors regarding their year remediation activities  discussions with the company s software vendors and service providers  identification of all source code and all imbedded chip logic that could contain date logic  analyzing source codes for the company systems identifying each individual occurrence of date logic  and simulating the year environment by rolling forward the date in test files of its principal it systems 
for the renovation phase  all core it system programming modifications have been completed by the company s systems development staff 
the system programming modifications included upgrading the distribution  inventory management and accounting systems and installation of new year compliant pos registers and software 
installation of the new pos system and software in the trans world stores was completed during the second quarter of fiscal replacements for the other non core it systems are being implemented on schedule 
the non core it systems being replaced include a system for tracking the opening of new stores and a system for managing lease payments 
validation and implementation efforts are underway 
formal systems testing for both it and non it systems is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal in order to complete the validation and implementation phases  the company will process daily  weekly and monthly transactions on the main corporate it systems platform  ibm as the compliance testing will be completed in a dedicated environment within the as to assure acceptance of all transactions in the year the company is exposed to both internal and external year risks 
internal risks exist due to the company s dependence on its it and non it systems 
the company is dependent on its it and non it systems for many of its everyday operations including inventory management  merchandise distribution  cash management  accounting and financial reporting 
the company utilizes a variety of vendors for its system needs 
the company has initiated discussions with its vendors and monitored their year compliance programs and the compliance of their merchandise or services with required standards 
although the majority of these vendors represent that their products are year compliant  the company will perform testing to validate the vendor representations no later than the second quarter of fiscal in the normal course of business  the company replaced its pos register system with a year compliant system during preliminary contingency plans for failure of internal systems include implementing manual procedures such as the use of manual merchandise picking and shipping to replace automated distribution center equipment 
external risks are represented by the fact that the company utilizes approximately  different suppliers in the normal course of its business 
five major merchandise vendors account for approximately of all purchases 
additionally  other merchandise vendors account for nearly of purchases 
the company is also dependent on financial institutions for consolidation of cash collections  and for cash payments 
although the company uses its own trucks for shipment of merchandise to approximately of its stores  the company does rely on a number of trucking companies for the remainder of its merchandise distribution 
evaluation of the company s vendors year readiness began in the fourth quarter of  and is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal upon completion of the assessment of vendor readiness  contingency plans will be developed for all third parties where year compliance appears to be at risk 
the company presently believes that its most likely worst case year scenarios would relate to the possible failure in one or more geographic regions of third party systems over which the company has no control and for which it has no ready substitute  such as  but not limited to  power and telecommunications services 
each trans world store has a crash kit which allows it to operate without power and telecommunications services and includes the ability to manually process all sales transactions 
however  in the event of a power disruption  it is highly unlikely that a store would be open for business due to the lack of lighting and the security related concerns 
the company has in place a disaster recovery plan that addresses recovery from various kinds of disasters  including recovery from significant interruptions to data flows and distribution capabilities at its data systems center and distribution center 
the company s disaster recovery plan provides specific routines for actions  personnel assignments and back up arrangements to ensure effective response to a disaster affecting key business functions including merchandise replenishment  cash management and distribution center operations 
common routines and back up arrangements include off site storage of information  manual processing of critical applications and the establishment of a chain of communication for key personnel 
the company is using that plan to further develop specific year contingency plans identified by its third party assessment phase which will emphasize locating alternate sources of supply  methods of distribution and ways of processing information 
the company s direct costs for its year remediation efforts total  to date 
anticipated future costs are  but could include an additional  to address year issues identified as a result of remediation testing 
these costs do not include expenditures made in the normal course of business  during and  to upgrade its distribution  inventory management and accounting systems  or costs to install new year compliant pos registers and software 
future costs will be funded by cash flows generated from operations 
the company s estimate of the costs of achieving year compliance and the date by which year compliance will be achieved are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions about future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
specific facts that might cause such material differences include the availability and cost of personnel trained in year remediation work  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the success achieved by the company s customers and suppliers in reaching year readiness  the timely availability of necessary replacement items and similar uncertainties
