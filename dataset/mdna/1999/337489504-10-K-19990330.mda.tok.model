item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and financial statements 
net income loss per share is based on the weighted average total shares of common stock outstanding 
because the company s income is based on its percentage interest in the operating partnership s income  the net income loss per share would be unchanged for the periods presented even if the common units were exchanged for common stock of the company 
the company considers funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds of operations on the same basis 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or of ability to make distributions 
our calculation of ffo may differ from that used by other companies and  therefore  the amounts disclosed above for ffo may not be comparable directly to similarly titled measures used by other companies

a large portion of the company s indebtedness will become due by  requiring balloon payments of  in and  in from through  the company will have to refinance an aggregate of approximately  since the company anticipates that only a small portion of the principal of such indebtedness will be repaid prior to maturity and the company will likely not have sufficient funds on hand to repay such indebtedness  the company will need to refinance such indebtedness through modification or extension of existing indebtedness  additional debt financing or through additional offering of equity securities 
in june  the company borrowed  under new mortgage loans collectively  the nomura mortgage loan collateralized by five of the properties 
these loans  which bear interest at day libor at december  plus and mature on july   were closed to prepayment for the first months and can be prepaid thereafter based on a declining prepayment penalty 
to mitigate its exposure to these variable rate loans  the company entered into a five year interest rate protection agreement for a notional amount of  that is effective through the loans maturity  and caps the interest rate at through the maturity date 
the cost of the interest rate protection agreement of approximately  is being amortized over the life of the agreement using the effective interest rate method resulting in an effective interest rate on the nomura mortgage loan of approximately per annum 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap is determined by the amounts at which they could be settled

if the company had settled these agreements with the counter party on december   the company would have paid approximately in anticipation of the large amounts of mortgage debt maturing in and  the company has entered into forward interest rate swap contracts 
the company intends to hold such contracts until their expiration dates 
the purpose of the swaps is to mitigate any exposure to fluctuations in interest rates until the maturity dates of the mortgages when the company expects to refinance these loans

other year issue the year issue is the result of many existing computer programs using only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs may not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the company is in the process of conducting a review of its computer systems to identify which systems could be affected by the year problem and to what extent such problems will have an impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company has developed a year compliance plan the plan to address these issues 
the plan is being managed by two of the company s senior executives and has been approved by senior management 
the progress of the plan is being monitored by the company s board of directors 
the plan focuses on four major components it systems such as the company s accounting and property management software packages and related hardware  non it systems such as the company s telephone system  voice mail system and other office equipment  the state of readiness of the company s critical trading partners such as its banks  utilities and tenants  and embedded systems  particularly those located at the company s retail properties such as sprinkler systems  security systems  etc 
note the retail properties access does not rely on elevator service because the structures are no higher than two stories 
the plan contains ten phases as follows estimated estimated phase description start date completion date educate senior management commenced completed designate a plan manager commenced completed inventory all systems commenced april  contact suppliers of systems commenced mail by may  send questionnaire to tenants all have been currently receiving mailed responses send questionnaire to other critical trading partners commenced mail by may  prioritize problems critical vs 
non critical commenced june  identify solutions repair or replace commenced july  test solutions july  august  anticipate contingencies including the most reasonably likely worst case scenario commenced continuous the company has incurred approximately to date in the implementation of the plan 
these costs have primarily been incurred to upgrade the desktop pc s at the company s home office 
the company has determined that implementing the plan will cost less than however  the company has budgeted to replace its current accounting and property management software system 
although the company believes that the current system is materially year compliant the company has decided to migrate because of the improved technology and reporting capabilities of the new system 
the company anticipates going live on the new system by october  these costs will be funded from the company s cash flow 
the plan efforts will be primarily staffed by employees of the company 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that the company s tenants are delayed in generating their rental payments due to their own year it problems 
if this occurs the company s property managers will attempt to accelerate rental payments by requesting manual checks by personally visiting the tenants or by contacting the appropriate personnel at the tenants accounts payable departments 
also  the company will have available its lines of credit to fund immediate cash flow needs if such delay occurs 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or if assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely or accurately with respect to year issues that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
also  there can be no assurance that the year issues of the company s suppliers  vendors  tenants and other important trading partners will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business or results of operations 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of relevant computer codes and embedded technology  and similar uncertainties 
although some of the company s agreements with suppliers and contractors contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify the company under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification agreements will cover all of the company s liabilities and costs related to claims by third parties related to the year issue 
inflation  economic conditions most of the company s leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include escalation clauses with fixed increases or increased related to changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
the leases may also contain clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rents based on tenant s gross sales above predetermined levels  which generally increase as prices rise 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay its pro rata share of the property operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate loans 
the company  as a general policy  endeavors to obtain fixed rate financing 
the company s financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which its properties are located 
an economic recession  or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions  could result in the inability of some existing tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s properties are typically anchored by supermarkets  drug stores and other consumer necessity and service retailers which usually offer day to day necessities rather than luxury items 
these types of tenants  in the experience of the company  generally maintain more consistent sales performance during periods of adverse economic conditions 
new accounting standards on march   the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus opinion on issue no  accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions which requires that the internal costs of preacquisition activities incurred in connection with the acquisition of an operating property be expensed as incurred 
the company has historically capitalized internal pre acquisition cost of operating properties as a component of the acquisition price 
the company capitalized for the period january through march  and for the twelve months ended december  the company experienced an increase in general and administrative expense due to the adoption of this ruling 
during the second quarter  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will be effective for the company s fiscal year this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company is currently assessing the impact of this new statement on its consolidated financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by management as an integral part of the company s overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on the company s results 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on the company s operating results are described below the company s operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowing under the company s line of credit facilities as well as other mortgages and notes with variable interest rates 
if interest rates increased by percent  the company s annual interest expense would have increased by  based on balances during the year ending december
