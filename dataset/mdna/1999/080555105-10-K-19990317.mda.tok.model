year the company has performed an enterprise wide evaluation to assess the ability of its information technology it and non it systems to function properly and execute transactions relating to the year the program includes the following phases project identification  estimation of costs and target end dates  system remediation or replacement  testing  integration  and vendor compliance assessment 
the company has substantially completed the first two phases of the program 
active management of projects in all other phases is ongoing 
all phases of the program are expected to be completed by december  or sooner 
the company is in the process of replacing systems in the publishing division  including certain systems related to advertising  circulation and editorial applications 
remediation and replacement of other systems in both the publishing and broadcast divisions is also underway 
the company expects to remediate or replace the affected systems in a timely manner 
the company s program includes testing of systems that have been corrected  upgraded or replaced and testing of applications and equipment identified as compliant 
once a system has been fully tested  it is integrated into the production environment 
while testing provides assurance that individual applications will properly perform required functions in  it is not possible to completely simulate the effect of year requirements 
the vendor compliance assessment phase includes contacting significant third party vendors in an effort to determine the state of their year readiness 
as are all businesses  belo is dependent upon certain vendors and suppliers whose delivery of product or service is material to the production and distribution of the company s products 
material vendors include  but are not limited to  utilities providers  telecommunications  news and content providers  television network and programming suppliers  and newsprint suppliers 
the company has initiated formal communications with its significant vendors and is monitoring responses and implementing additional follow up measures as necessary 
however  there can be no assurances that it and non it systems of third parties that the company may rely upon will be year compliant in a timely manner  and therefore the company could be adversely affected by failure of a significant third party to become year compliant 
the company believes the year issues associated with its it and non it systems will be mitigated by the implementation of previously planned system replacements 
costs associated with these system replacements have been included in the company s capital plans and have been funded primarily with cash provided by operations 
the company has expensed million in connection with its year program through december   including million expensed in  and does not expect remaining year expenses to be significant 
the business risks to the company for failure to achieve year compliance vary  and depend upon the system and the business unit affected 
while the company believes its year projects will be completed on a timely basis  failure to successfully complete significant portions of its year program or failure by significant third parties to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on various phases of the company s newspaper and broadcasting operations  and therefore  on its operating results and financial condition 
although the company has not adopted a formal contingency plan  it is in the process of reviewing existing contingency plans and assessing alternatives at the individual project level in the event year issues arise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company s strategy in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to maintain a balance of fixed and variable rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the contractual interest rates of the company s debt 
at december  and  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt was estimated to be  and  respectively  using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt  such as the coupon rate and term to maturity 
such fair values exceeded the carrying value of fixed rate debt at december  and by  and  respectively 
various financial instruments issued by the company are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of the company s fixed rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to the company s fixed rate debt outstanding at december  and  a percent decline in interest rates would have resulted in no material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
with respect to the floating rate debt at december   a percent increase in interest rates would result in a  annual change in the company s pre tax earnings and cash flows 
in addition to interest rate risk  the company has exposure to changes in the price of newsprint 
the average price of newsprint is expected to be lower in than  although future prices for newsprint cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company historically has managed the risk of price increases through a combination of rate increases and expense reductions
