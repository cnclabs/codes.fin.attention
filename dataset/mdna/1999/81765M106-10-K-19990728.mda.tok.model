in november  the company closed on the  twenty one year bond financing for its new manufacturing facility 
the bonds bear interest at prevailing market rates  reset weekly 
in an effort to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations in connection with the bonds  the company entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements with suntrust bank  atlanta  in february the first swap agreement terminates in february the notional amount reduces annually from  at inception to  at the expiration of the agreement 
the agreement calls for the company to make fixed rate payments to suntrust of per annum of the notional amount  in exchange for suntrust making floating rate payments based on the day non financial aa commercial paper rate 
the second interest rate swap agreement terminates in february the notional amount reduces annually from  at inception to  at the expiration of the agreement 
the remaining terms of the second agreement are identical to the terms of the first except the fixed rate payment is per annum 
the notional amounts of the swap agreements are set to match the outstanding principal amount of the bonds 
the swap floating rates are reset weekly  and the company settles with the counterparty monthly 
the company expects the counterparty to the agreements to abide by the terms of the agreements 
at april   the company had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling  of which  was outstanding and an additional  was reserved for the letter of credit issued for the jackson  michigan loan discussed above 
the company also had a committed line of credit totaling  secured by the manufacturing segment s inventory and receivables  of which  was outstanding at year end 
on april   in order to facilitate the sale of the newnan  georgia shopping center  the company drew  on the lines of credit to have funds available to pay the related mortgage debt 
this draw was repaid in may in july  the company purchased an approximately  square foot shopping center located in jacksonville  florida  for  the purchase was financed with funds received from the sale of the newnan  georgia shopping center  cash held by the company  and the company s lines of credit

in conjunction with the loan  an additional interest agreement was executed which entitles the lender to be paid additional interest equal to fifty percent of the quarterly net cash flow and fifty percent of the appreciation in the property upon sale or refinance 
effects of inflation on revenues and operating profits the effects of inflation upon the company s operating results are varied 
inflation in the current year has been modest and has had minimal effect on the company 
the construction segment subcontracts most of its work at fixed prices  which normally will help that segment protect its profit margin percentage 
in the manufacturing segment  the raw material prices were stable 
in the real estate segment  many of the leases are long term over years with fixed rents except for contingent rent provisions by which the company may earn additional rent as a result of increases in tenants sales 
in most cases  however  the contingent rent provisions permit the tenant to offset against contingent rents any increases in ad valorem taxes over a specified amount 
if inflation were to rise  ad valorem taxes would probably increase which  in turn  would cause a decrease in the contingent rents 
furthermore  the company has certain repair obligations  and the costs of repairs increase with inflation 
inflation causes a rise in interest rates  which has a positive effect on investment income  but has a negative effect on profit margins because of the increased costs of contracts  production  and operations 
overall  inflation will tend to limit the company s markets and  in turn  will reduce revenues as well as operating profits 
year the year has presented a problem for companies who use computer systems which were developed without the ability to properly recognize and process data relating to the year and beyond 
such systems may include hardware  software and other telecommunications information systems it  as well as computer systems that do not relate to information technology  such as building and other ancillary systems non it 
the company  its vendors  suppliers  and other significant third party service providers are all exposed to the potential disruption of operations if such systems are not replaced or remediated 
the company substantially has completed its assessment and remediation efforts for achieving year compliance in its it and non it systems 
all computer hardware and software have been inventoried and tested 
the construction segment has purchased a new year compliant accounting software package and upgraded its computer hardware system 
the cost of the software and hardware and the installation thereof is not considered to be material 
the company installed the new hardware and software during the second quarter and began using it in the third quarter the manufacturing segment  at a nominal cost  plans to upgrade its current accounting software to be year compliant by august  and the real estate segment s accounting software is year compliant 
other non compliant hardware and software review and remediation costs are considered to be minimal 
the company has conducted a written survey of its it and non it significant third party vendors and service providers to determine their year compliance status 
the responses have indicated these businesses will be substantially compliant on a timely basis 
the company  however  cannot ensure that various third parties with which it deals will be year compliant 
the failure of such third parties  such as banks  significant customers  tenants and vendors to become year compliant on a timely basis could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
uncertainty exists concerning the scope and magnitude of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company has not developed a contingency plan for dealing with any catastrophic failure of the government  utility companies  lending institutions or other regulated agencies  but will consider the need for such if public or other information regarding the state of readiness of these entities or other significant third parties indicates imminent problems 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and correct all aspects of the effect of the year issue on the company 
management  however  does not believe that the year issue will pose significant problems in its it or non it systems  or that resolution of any potential problems with respect to these systems will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

after a period of investigation and deliberation  those discussions were terminated 
the company has not formalized any alternative strategy  and although the investigation of other possible strategic and financial alternatives is ongoing  there is no assurance whatsoever that any transaction ultimately will result
