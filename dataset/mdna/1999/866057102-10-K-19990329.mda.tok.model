during the same period  federal funds sold decreased million or and federal funds purchased and fhlb advances increased million and million  respectively 
on august   the company issued a two for one stock split which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the stated par value of each share was not changed from on december   a stock distribution in the form of a stock dividend was issued to shareholders of record as of december  this distribution resulted in the issuance of  shares of the company s par value common stock 
all weighted average share and per share data has been restated to reflect the stock split and stock distribution 
loans the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial loans  commercial loans secured by real estate  loans secured by one to four family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
substantially all of these loans are located in the upstate of south carolina and are concentrated in the company s market area 
at december   the company had no loans for highly leveraged transactions and no foreign loans 
the bank s primary focus has been on commercial lending to small and medium sized businesses in its marketplace 
commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the company had total loans outstanding  net of unearned income  of million which represents an increase of million or from the outstanding loans of million 
outstanding loans represent the largest component of earning assets at of average earning assets for compared to for gross loans were and  respectively  of total assets at december  and the increase in loans between and is attributable to internal growth as the company did not purchase any loans during the year 
freedom s outstanding loans  net of unearned income  totaled million  or of consolidated loans at december  this is compared to million or of consolidated loans at december  for  the company s loans averaged million with a yield of 
this is compared to million average loans with a yield of in the interest rates charged on loans of the bank vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government policy and regulations also influence interest rates 
loans of the finance company are regulated under state laws which establish the maximum loan amounts and interest rates  and the types and maximum amounts of fees  insurance premiums  and other costs that may be charged 
the decrease in the loan yield during reflects the general declining rate environment experienced in the fourth quarter of at which time the prime lending rate dropped basis points 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio and of the consolidated loan portfolio have variable rates and immediately reprice with a change in the prime rate 
the drop in prime during is combined with the continuing competitive pricing pressures on loans of the company to reduce the overall yield on loans during the year 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount charged to the provision for loan losses by the bank and the finance company is based on management s judgment as to the amounts required to maintain an adequate allowance 
the level of this allowance is dependent upon growth in the loan portfolios  the total amount of past due loans  nonperforming loans  and known loan deteriorations and or concentrations of credit 
other factors affecting the allowance are trends in portfolio volume  maturity and composition  projected collateral values  and general economic conditions 
finally  management s assessment of potential losses based upon internal credit grading of the loans and periodic reviews and assessments of credit risk associated with particular loans is considered in establishing the allowance amount 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses which it believes adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
there are risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management uses the best information available to make evaluations  however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations 
the company is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to the adequacy of the allowance  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance in comparison to a group of peer companies identified by the regulatory agencies 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans at the end of this is compared to a million allowance or of total loans at december  for the year ended december   the company reported net charge offs of  or of consolidated average loans 
this is compared to consolidated net charge offs of  or of average loans for the year ended december  loans past due days and greater totaled  or of gross loans at december  compared to  or 
of gross loans at december  there were no loans on nonaccrual at either december  or generally  loans of the bank are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of when they are days past due or when the collection of the loan becomes doubtful 
loans of the finance company are not classified as nonaccrual  but are charged off when such become days contractually past due or earlier if the loan is deemed uncollectible 
at december  and  the bank held no other real estate owned acquired in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans 
there were no impaired loans at either december  or deposits during  interest bearing liabilities averaged million with an average rate of compared to million with an average rate of in the decrease in the average rate is primarily a result of maturing cds at higher rates that were replaced with lower current market rates and the general restructuring of the deposit portfolio with increases in money market and demand accounts which have a lower cost of funds 
in pricing deposits  the company considers its liquidity needs  the direction and levels of interest rates and local market conditions 
at december   interest bearing deposits comprised approximately of total deposits and of interest bearing liabilities 
the remainder of interest bearing liabilities consists principally of federal home loan bank advances  federal funds purchased  and securities sold under repurchase agreements 
the company uses its deposit base as a primary source with which to fund earning assets 
deposits decreased from million at december  to million as of year end the decline was anticipated as the company focused on restructuring its deposits to replace certificates of deposit maturities with lower cost demand and money market accounts 
in addition  the company utilized excess liquidity and other financing strategies to fund loan growth and maintain its net interest margin during a period of declining rates 
the company s core deposit base consists of consumer and commercial money market accounts  checking accounts  savings and retirement accounts  now accounts  and non jumbo time deposits less than 
although such core deposits are becoming increasingly interest sensitive for both the company and the industry as a whole  these deposits continue to provide the company with a large and stable source of funds 
core deposits as a percentage of total deposits were approximately and  respectively  at december  and the company closely monitors its reliance on certificates of deposit greater than  which are generally considered less stable and more interest rate sensitive than core deposits 
certificates of deposit in excess of  represented and  respectively  of total deposits at december  and the company has no brokered deposits 
investment securities at december   the company s total investment portfolio had a market value of million  which is a decrease of from the million invested as of the end of investments had an amortized cost at the year end of million 
the investment portfolio consists primarily of united states treasury securities  securities of united states government agencies  mortgage backed securities  and state and municipal obligations 
the company has no trading account securities 
at the year end  the portfolio had a weighted average maturity of approximately years and an average duration of years 
investment securities averaged million yielding in  compared to the average of million yielding 
securities are the second largest earning asset of the company at and of average earning assets for and  respectively 
income statement review general the company reported record earnings in which were up from net income totaled million  or diluted earnings per share  in compared with million  or diluted earnings per share in and million or diluted earnings per share for the improvement in net income and earnings per share between and resulted primarily from the growth in earning assets combined with a reduction in the overall cost of funds 
increases in other income  primarily nondeposit investment product sales  also contributed to the increase in net income in income statement review summary of changes for the years ended december  change change net interest income     provision for loan losses net interest income after provision     other income   other expense    income before taxes    provision for income taxes  net income    net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid for the liabilities used to support those assets 
it is the largest component of the company s earnings and changes in it have the greatest impact on net income 
variations in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and their relative sensitivity to interest rate movements determine changes in net interest income 
during  the company recorded net interest income of million  a increase from the net interest income of million 
this is compared to net interest income of million for the increase in net interest income in is directly related to the increase in the average loan and deposit volume of the bank of and  respectively 
net interest income increased in also related to the higher average loan and deposit volume of the bank which was up from by and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company s net interest margin was  compared to in and for the net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the margin for remained relatively constant with the prior year due primarily to the reduction in the cost of funds which offset the declining rate environment experienced as the prime rate decreased basis points to in the fourth quarter of the increase in the net interest margin between and is related to the general rising rate environment during that period as the prime rate increased from to in march average yields and rates for the years ended december  on a fully tax equivalent basis earning assets loans securities short term investments total earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits short term borrowings fhlb advances total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin prime interest rate interest income interest income for was million which was a million or increase over the million for interest income for was million 
the increases each year are primarily a result of the higher level of earning assets which averaged million  million and million in  and  respectively 
changes in average yield on earning assets also affects the interest income reported each year 
the average yield increased from in to in  while the average yield dropped to in due to the declining rate environment 
the majority of the increase in average earning assets between and and between and was in loans  which are the company s highest yielding assets at approximately of average earning assets for the year ended consolidated loans averaged million in with an average yield of  compared to million in with an average yield of  and million in with an average yield of 
the higher loan yield in as compared to results from the increase in market rates and higher pricing on new loan originations in the average loan rate dropped in as compared to as a direct result of the decline in the prime rate which averaged in and in combined with the general declining rate environment in were continuing competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace 
the second largest component of earning assets is the company s investment portfolio which averaged million yielding in this is compared to average securities of million in yielding  and million yielding for the increase in the average yield of the investment portfolio is related to the timing  maturity distribution and types of securities purchased 
specifically in  tax free municipal securities were purchased which contributed significantly to the increase in average yield on a fully tax equivalent basis for as compared to the prior years 
the higher level of average securities each year  combined with the increases in average rate  resulted in an increase in interest income on investments of  or between and and the increase of  or between and interest expense the company s interest expense for was million  compared to million for and million for the increase in interest expense of between and and between and is primarily related to the and increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities in and  respectively 
the decrease of basis points in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities in partially offset the higher interest expense related to the increased volume of interest bearing liabilities in that year 
the lower average rate in was primarily a result of the maturity of higher priced cds combined with the restructure of the deposit portfolio to lower costing money market deposits 
interest bearing liabilities averaged million in with an average rate of  compared to million in with an average rate of  and an average of million with an average rate of during provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the change in the provision each year was directly related to the level of net originations in each year as follows million in  million in  and million in another factor influencing the amount charged to the provision each year is the total outstanding loans and charge off activity of the finance company in relation to the consolidated totals 
loans of the finance company generally have higher inherent risk than do loans of the bank  and thus  require a higher provision 
estimates charged to the provision for loan losses are based on management s judgment as to the amount required to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio and are adjusted as necessary 
other income and other expenses other income increased  or  to million in from million in and  in credit card related fees and income  the largest single item in other income  rose to  in from  in and  in the increase is related to the higher volume of transactions and merchant activity in the bank s credit card portfolio each year 
the higher amount in service charges and fees on deposit accounts  which increased in to  from  in and  in  is related to the increase in the number of bank deposit accounts and transactions subject to service charges and fees 
insurance commission fee income increased  between and and  between and related to the higher level of activity for both the bank and the finance company 
included in insurance commissions is income from annuity sales made in the bank s nondeposit investment sales department and earned commissions on credit related insurance products generated by the finance company 
the remainder of the changes in other income is related to late charge income on loans of the bank and the finance company which increased  in and  in related to the higher number of branches and customer accounts  and the level of activity in the bank s nondeposit financial services and brokerage department which resulted in increased income in of  and a decrease in of  total other expenses were million in  million in  and million in a majority of the increased expenditures each year reflects the cost of additional personnel hired to support the company s growth and the new bank branch opened in salaries  wages and benefits amounted to million in  million in  and million in the increase of  in was a result of normal annual raises  the bank increasing the total number of employees related to the opening of the new branch in october  higher commissions paid related to the increased volume of nondeposit product sales in  the amortization of compensation expense related to restricted stock granted in late  and additional benefit accruals pursuant to a new retirement plan implemented in the  increase in was related to normal annual raises  the bank adding additional personnel in the latter part of to support the higher level of activity  and the finance company s operations which accounted for of the increase in due to the opening of additional branches during the year 
occupancy and furniture  fixtures  and equipment expenses increased  or to million in from  in and  in the increase in was related primarily to higher depreciation and associated expenses at the bank related to technology implementations  furnishing and equipment additions  and other expenses for the new branch facility which opened in october the increase from to was primarily related to the finance company adding new branches in early  combined with technology hardware and software upgrades implemented at the bank during included in the line item other operating expenses  which increased  or between and and  or between and  are charges for insurance claims and premiums  printing and office support  credit card expenses  professional services  advertising and public relations  and other branch and customer related expenses 
these items are related directly to the normal operations of the bank and increase in relation to the increase in assets  the higher level of transaction volume  and the larger number of customer accounts 
the bank s activity accounted for a  increase in and  increase in  primarily related to the higher level of activity and number of accounts as compared to the prior year and technology related consultant expenses in the remainder of the consolidated increase  or  in and  in  was generated by the activity of the parent company and finance company  including charges for annual reports and shareholder relations  and credit reports  license fees  acquisition premium amortization  and office support for freedom 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million   and  for   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in each year was   and  respectively 
the decrease in effective rate each year is primarily related to the higher level of tax free municipal investments 
capital resources total shareholders equity amounted to million  or of total assets  at december  this is compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the million increase in total shareholders equity resulted principally from retention of earnings  stock issued pursuant to the company s incentive stock option plan  and the increase in unrealized gain on investments available for sale 
book value per share at december  and was and  respectively 
the company has issued seven stock distributions in the form of stock dividends to shareholders between june and december in august  the company issued a two for one stock split which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the stated par value of each share was not changed from capital summary the company the bank as of as of as of as of total risk based capital tier risk based capital leverage capital the table presented above sets forth various capital ratios for the company and the bank at december  and the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
at december  and  the company and the bank were in compliance with each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
the bank exceeded the well capitalized standard under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to date  the capital needs of the company have been met through the retention of earnings and from the proceeds of its initial offering of common stock 
the company believes that the rate of asset growth will not negatively impact the capital base 
the company has no commitments or immediate plans for any significant capital expenditures outside of the normal course of business 
the company s management does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in the company s capital resources materially increasing or decreasing 
liquidity liquidity management involves meeting the cash flow requirements of the company 
the company must maintain an adequate liquidity position in order to respond to the short term demand for funds caused by withdrawals from deposit accounts  maturities of repurchase agreements  extensions of credit  and for the payment of operating expenses 
maintaining an adequate level of liquidity is accomplished through a combination of liquid assets  those which can easily be converted into cash  and access to additional sources of funds 
the company s primary liquid assets are cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  unpledged investment securities available for sale  other short term investments and maturing loans 
these primary liquidity sources accounted for and of average assets for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
in management s opinion  the company maintains adequate levels of liquidity by retaining sufficient liquid assets and assets which can be easily converted into cash and by maintaining access to various sources of funds 
the primary sources of funds available through the bank include advances from the federal home loan bank  purchasing federal funds from other financial institutions  lines of credit through the federal reserve bank  and increasing deposits by raising rates paid 
summit financial corporation summit financial  the parent holding company  has limited liquidity needs 
summit financial requires liquidity to pay limited operating expenses  to service its debt  and to provide funding to its consumer finance subsidiary  freedom finance 
summit financial has million in available liquidity remaining from its initial public offering and the retention of earnings 
all of this liquidity was advanced to the finance company to fund its operations as of december  in addition  summit financial has an available line of credit totaling million with an unaffiliated financial institution  all of which was available at december  at december   summit financial also had a term loan agreement totaling  with a director of the company to provide liquidity for funding the operating needs of freedom 
further sources of liquidity for summit financial include additional borrowings from individuals  and management fees and debt service which are paid by its subsidiary on a monthly basis 
liquidity needs of freedom finance  primarily for the funding of loan originations  acquisitions  and operating expenses  have been met to date through the initial capital investment of  made by summit financial  borrowings from an unrelated private investor  and line of credit facilities provided by summit financial and summit national bank  a sister company 
the company s management believes its liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs and does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars  without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most other industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect in a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the yield on a majority of the company s earning assets adjusts simultaneously with changes in the general level of interest rates 
approximately of the company s liabilities at december  had been issued with fixed terms and can be repriced only at maturity 
during periods of falling interest rates  as experienced in late  the company s assets reprice faster than the supporting liabilities 
this causes a decrease in the net interest margin until the fixed rate deposits mature and are repriced at then lower current market rates  thus narrowing the difference between what the company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities 
given the company s current balance sheet structure  the opposite effect that is  an increase in net interest income is realized in a rising rate environment 
accounting  reporting and regulatory matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas changes the previous accounting definition of a derivative and discusses the appropriateness of hedge accounting for various forms of hedging activities 
under this standard  all derivatives are measured at fair value and recognized in the statement of financial position as assets or liabilities 
this standard is effective for all fiscal quarters and years beginning after june  because the company has no derivative activity at this time  management does not expect that this standard will have a significant effect on the company 
year the company recognizes that there is a business risk in computerized systems as the calendar rolls into the next century 
the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec issued an interagency statement on may   providing an outline for institutions to effectively manage the year yk challenges 
the company has developed an ongoing plan designed to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by yk software failures due to processing errors arising from calculations using dates after december  the company has an internal task force assigned to this project and the board of directors and management of the company have established year compliance as a strategic initiative 
the company has completed the assessment phase of the project in which all critical applications are identified and programming issues determined 
in conjunction with this phase  the company inventoried all of its hardware  software  and environmental or other non computerized systems 
each inventory item equipment  application  or service provider system has been prioritized and evaluated as to its yk compliance 
currently  all systems identified as mission critical have been certified as yk compliant by the vendors providing the software applications or hardware 
the company has substantially completed its testing phase for both the mission critical applications as well as other inventoried items 
the company has established timelines for testing all noncritical software and ancillary systems  such as telephone systems and security devices 
finally  the company is in the process of completing both its remediation and business resumption contingency plans 
in these contingency plans  all possible scenarios have attempted to be addressed  including the resources and procedures necessary to manually process transactions in the event the core systems do not function on january  while the company believes that it has available resources to assure yk compliance  it is to some extent dependent on vendor cooperation 
accordingly  management is in constant contact with its various vendors and is monitoring their yk efforts on an on going basis 
in addition to the internal processing risks associated with the year issue  the company has made every attempt to address external risks  primarily credit and liquidity  associated with our major customers and their year remediation efforts 
the way that these material customers approach and comply with yk readiness will have a potentially significant impact on the company 
in an effort to identify and manage the risks posed by those customers  the company has identified material customers  evaluated their year preparedness through questionnaires and interviews  assessed their year risk to the company  and implemented appropriate controls to manage and mitigate their year related risk to the company 
the controls implemented may include ongoing monitoring of a customer s yk remediation efforts  review and adjustment of credit maturities  obtaining additional collateral  or including specific year language in loan agreements  as appropriate 
management is also addressing all new relationships for yk risk 
currently  there are no significant customers which are rated as a high year risk and which the company believes a risk of loss is present 
other components of the company s year customer awareness program include questionnaires for major customers  hosting seminars for customers  distributing the company s year position statement which contains the initiatives and status of the company s yk efforts  and informative mailers and brochures describing the year challenges in general as well as specific information related to the company 
at this time  the company believes the cost of making modifications to correct any yk issues will be nominal 
corrections and fixes to software provided by third party vendors is covered in the annual maintenance fees paid by the company on a regular basis 
in addition  equipment and software acquisition expenses are not expected to materially differ from historical levels as the company routinely upgrades and purchases technologically advanced software and hardware on a continual basis and expects to specifically evaluate and test such purchases for yk compliance 
there has been no significant change to the company s existing technology plans due to any year issues 
the company s management believes it has adequately addressed the year issue and has adequate resources and personnel executing the year action plan to ensure compliance in accordance with the timeframes established in the plan and as mandated by the regulatory agencies which oversee the company and its subsidiaries 
the company s bank subsidiary has already been subject to and will undergo additional examinations of its year initiatives to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements 
management does not know of any trends  events  or uncertainities related to the year issues that it believes may result in a significant adverse effect on the company s financial position 
interest rate sensitivity achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the company s asset liability function 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings and to achieve consistent growth in net interest income 
the company seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
the company s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be significant over time 
the company s asset liability committee alco uses a simulation model  among other techniques  to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account  over a month period or longer if necessary  interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios and rate shocks 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated as necessary throughout the year in order to maintain a current forecast as assumptions change 
according to the model  the company is presently positioned so that net interest income will increase slightly if interest rates rise in the near term and will decrease slightly if interest rates decline in the near term 
the company also uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period 
the static interest sensitivity gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is also reviewed periodically to provide insights related to static repricing structure of assets and liabilities 
at december   on a cumulative basis through months  rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  resulting in a month period liability sensitive position at the end of of million 
when the effective change ratio the historical relative movement of each asset s and liability s rates in relation to a basis point change in the prime rate is applied to the interest gap position  the company is actually in an asset sensitive position over a month period and the entire repricing lives of the assets and liabilities 
this is primarily due to the fact that of the loan portfolio moves immediately on a one to one ratio with a change in the prime rate  while the deposit accounts do not increase or decrease as much relative to a prime rate movement 
the company s asset sensitive position means that assets reprice faster than the liabilities  resulting in increases in the net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income when market rates decline 
in  the prime rate increased as did the company s net interest margin as compared to in the fourth quarter of  interest rates dropped  leading to declines in the average yield on assets for as compared to however  the company was able to maintain the net interest margin relatively constant with the margin due to the reduction in the overall cost of funds based primarily on the higher percentage of floating rate deposits in as compared to which allowed the company to respond to the prime rate drops  and the maturities of higher priced certificates of deposit throughout which were replaced with cds at lower current rates during the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  as in credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and it could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the bank s alco monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items over a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
a primary purpose of the company s asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a periodic basis by the board of directors and the alco which is charged with the responsibility to maintain the level of sensitivity of the bank s net portfolio value within board approved limits 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
the company s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum allowable decreases in npv in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes included in these forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of l are subject to certain risks  uncertainities  and assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those expected or projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of the document 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to publicly release any updates or revisions to any forward looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard to any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of year end 
this table indicates that at december   in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in the prevailing market interest rates  the company s npv would be expected to decrease  and that in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in rate  the company s npv would be expected to increase
