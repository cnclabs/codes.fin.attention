item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations years ended december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts overview slm holding corporation slm holding was formed on february   as a wholly owned subsidiary of the student loan marketing association the gse 
on august   pursuant to the student loan marketing association reorganization act of the privatization act and approval by shareholders of an agreement and plan of reorganization  the gse was reorganized into a subsidiary of slm holding the reorganization 
slm holding is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries including the gse 
references herein to the company refer to the gse and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the reorganization and to slm holding and its subsidiaries for periods after the reorganization 
the company is the largest source of financing and servicing for education loans in the united states primarily through its participation in the federal family education loan program ffelp  formerly the guaranteed student loan program 
the company s products and services include student loan purchases and commitments to purchase student loans  as well as operational support to originators of student loans and to post secondary education institutions and other education related financial services 
the company also originates and holds unguaranteed private loans 
the following management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and information that are based on management s current expectations as of the date of this document 
discussions that utilize the words intends  anticipate  believe  estimate  intend and expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties  assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  changes in the terms of student loans and the educational credit marketplace arising from the implementation of applicable laws and regulations and from changes in such laws and regulations  which may reduce the volume  average term and costs of yields on student loans under the ffelp or result in loans being originated or refinanced under non ffelp programs or may affect the terms upon which banks and others agree to sell ffelp loans to the company 
the company could also be affected by changes in the demand for educational financing or in financing preferences of lenders  educational institutions  students and their families  and changes in the general interest rate environment and in the securitization markets for student loans  which may increase the costs or limit the availability of financings necessary to initiate  purchase or carry student loans  and interruptions in the company s or others operations resulting from the inability of computer or other systems to process year related information  which may impact the company s liquidity and its ability to obtain  generate or process documents or payments received from or due to others

first  the turbulence in the global financial markets following the russian bond default in august caused financing spreads  relative to treasury bill rates  to widen to levels where term financing in the securitization market did not make economic sense to management 
as a result  the company did not enter into securitization transactions during the second half of and only securitized billion of student loans in  which was billion less than in in  the company recorded after tax securitization gains of million  which were million less than the after tax securitization gains of million in exclusive of the million one time gain associated with the successful outcome of the offset fee litigation discussed below 
another factor in directly related to the financial market turmoil was declining treasury bill rates which had the effect of increasing the spread earned on a significant portion of the company s portfolio of managed student loans  particularly in the second half of the year 
as treasury bill rates declined  the cost of funds on the company s floating rate liabilities declined while an increasing percentage of student loans began to earn at the minimum borrower rate and  as a result  the rate earned on the portfolio of student loans did not decline as much as the rate on the company s floating rate liabilities 
after tax operating expenses of million in declined by million from  which included million of after tax restructuring charges 
during  the company spent million to repurchase million common shares or percent of its outstanding shares  which enhanced earnings per share growth 
in addition to reporting results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company also presents pro forma results of operations  which treat securitization transactions as financings and the securitized student loans as not sold 
management refers to these pro forma results as cash basis earnings and believes that they assist in better understanding the company s results of operations 
the company s cash basis net income was million in diluted earnings per share versus million diluted earnings per share in see pro forma statements of income 
net interest income net interest income is derived largely from the company s portfolio of student loans that remain on balance sheet 
a detailed discussion of the factors influencing returns on student loans can be found in a later section titled student loans 
taxable equivalent net interest income of million in decreased by million from in large part the decline resulted from the billion reduction in the average balance of interest earning assets due to the securitization of student loans and the significant downsizing of other earning assets that occurred in the latter half of in  the average balance of student loans on balance sheet declined by billion while the average balance of the portfolio of securitized student loans increased by billion 
as the company moves student loans off balance sheet via its securitization activities  the earnings from those loans are  in effect  removed from net interest income and become elements of other income  specifically  gain on sale of student loans and servicing and securitization revenue 
the average balance of the company s investment portfolio and warehousing advances combined declined by billion in as management reduced these lower yielding assets to better utilize capital 
in total  these reductions in earning assets reduced taxable equivalent net interest income by million 
the effect of the reduction in interest earning assets was partially offset by an increase of 
percent in the net interest margin from to  which increased taxable equivalent net interest income by million in over this margin increase was due in large part to the increased percentage of student loans remaining on balance sheet relative to other earning assets percent in vs 
percent in as well as the increase in student loan spread of 
percent which is discussed more fully under student loans student loan spread analysis 
taxable equivalent net interest income and net interest margin for the year ended december   decreased by million and 
percent from  respectively 
the million decrease in taxable equivalent net interest income attributable to the change in rates in versus was principally due to the decrease in the student loan spread discussed below under student loans student loan spread analysis 
other factors contributing to the decrease were the write off of million of deferred hedge losses in the third quarter of and a decrease of million due to rising treasury bill rates  which had the effect of lowering the spread earned on a significant portion of student loans as financing costs increased while the student loans were earning at the minimum borrower rate 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in income of million from the amortization of upfront payments received from floor revenue contracts and higher interest spreads on investments 
the million decrease in taxable equivalent net interest income attributable to the change in volume was due mainly to the decrease in the average balance of student loans on balance sheet as a result of securitizations

offset fees 


student loan income cost of funds student loan spread off balance sheet servicing and securitization revenue average balances in millions of dollars student loans    securitized loans    managed student loans    the company s portfolio of student loans originated under the ffelp has a variety of unique interest rate characteristics 
the company earns interest at the greater of the borrower s rate or a floating rate determined by reference to the average of the weekly auctions of day treasury bills by the government  plus a fixed spread which is dependent upon when the loan was originated 
if the floating rate exceeds the borrower rate  the department of education subsidizes the rate paid by the borrower and makes a special allowance payment sap directly to the company 
if the floating rate is less than the rate the borrower is obligated to pay  the company simply earns interest at the borrower rate 
in all cases  the rate a borrower is obligated to pay sets a minimum rate for determining the yield that the company earns on the loan 
borrowers interest rates are either fixed to term or are reset annually on july of each year depending on when the loan was originated 
the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate debt tied to the average of the day treasury bill auctions  either directly or through the use of derivative financial instruments  to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the student loans 
such borrowings  however  do not have minimum rates 
as a result  in periods of declining interest rates  the portfolio of managed student loans may be earning at the minimum borrower rate while the cost of the company s floating rate liabilities will generally decline along with treasury bill rates 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is reset annually  a low interest rate environment will only enhance student loan spreads if treasury bill rates fall after the loans reset and then only through the next annual reset of the borrowers interest rates  which occurs on july of each year 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is fixed to term  declining interest rates may benefit the spread earned on student loans for extended periods of time 
assuming the decline in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt exactly matched the decline in treasury bill rates  then the effect of lower treasury bill rates in increased the company s on balance sheet student loan spread by million  net of payments under floor interest contracts discussed below  of which million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates fixed to term and million was attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates adjusting annually 
in  funding spreads widened by 
percent which offset the effect of the declining treasury bill rates on the student loan spread by approximately million 
the following table analyzes the ability of the ffelp student loans in the company s managed student loan portfolio to earn at the minimum borrower interest rate at december  and  based on the last treasury bill auction of the year percent in and percent in

percent increase in the student loan spread from to was mainly due to the lower treasury bill rates in discussed above offset by the higher funding spreads on the company s debt and higher consolidation loan rebate fees 
the increase in the earnings from servicing and securitization revenue is also due to the lower treasury bill rates 
the decrease in the student loan spread in versus was due to the increase in treasury bill rates  which reduced the spread earned on student loans as financing costs increased while a significant portion of the company s student loan portfolio continued to earn at the minimum borrower rate 
also  the combined impact of consolidation loan rebate fees and offset fees reduced the student loan spread by 
percent in versus other factors reducing student loan spread were the relative increase in participations in student loans owned by the joint venture with the chase manhattan bank the joint venture  which contractually yield a lower rate than the underlying student loans and lower student loan yields in the form of reduced sap rates  partially offset by increased revenues from the amortization of upfront payments received from student loan floor interest contracts 
student loan floor interest contracts periodically the company and third parties have entered into contracts to monetize the value of the minimum borrower interest rate feature of its portfolio of ffelp student loans 
these contracts are referred to as floor interest contracts under which the company receives an upfront payment and agrees to pay the difference between the minimum borrower interest rate less the applicable sap rate the strike rate and the average of the day treasury bill rates over the period of the contract 
if the strike rate is less than the average of the treasury bill rates  then no payment is required 
these upfront payments are being amortized over the average life of the contracts 
floor interest contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is reset annually have historically been sold through the next reset date  a period of one year or less  while floor interest contracts sold on loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term have been sold for multi year periods 
the billion of outstanding fixed borrower rate floor interest contracts at december  have expiration dates through the year  while the billion of annually reset borrower rate contracts expires on june  for the years ended december   and  the amortization of the upfront payments received from the sale of floor interest contracts with annually reset borrower rates was million  million and million  respectively 
at december   unamortized payments received from the sale of floor interest contracts totaled million  million of which related to contracts on fixed rate loans and million of which related to contracts on annual reset loans 
provision for losses the provision for losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses net of recoveries inherent in the on balance sheet portfolio of loans  academic facilities financings  investments and derivatives 
in evaluating the adequacy of the provision for losses  the company considers several factors including trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  default rates on non federally insured student loans  the amount of ffelp loans subject to two percent risk sharing  and the credit exposure on all other investments and derivative instruments 
the provision included million for potential losses on the non federally insured portfolio and million for potential losses due to risk sharing 
once a student loan is charged off as a result of an unpaid claim  the company s policy is to continue to pursue the recovery of principal and interest 
in connection with legislation reauthorizing the higher education act  the deadline for borrowers to consolidate student loans under the federal direct student loan program fdslp at advantageous rates was extended to january  applications from borrowers who applied for consolidation prior to december  will continue to be processed through the third quarter of as a result  the company increased the provision for losses by million to provide for write offs for unusual loan prepayments at amounts less than carrying value 
management believes that the provision for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the student loan portfolio 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
for and  the company added million and million  respectively  for potential losses on the non federally insured portfolio  and million and million in and  respectively  for potential losses due to risk sharing 
the provision was reduced by million due to improved experience in recovering unpaid claims 
on balance sheet funding costs the company s borrowings are generally variable rate indexed principally to the day treasury bill rate

weighted average borrowing rate securitization program in  the company completed two securitization transactions in which a total of billion of student loans were sold to a special purpose finance subsidiary and by that subsidiary to trusts that issued asset backed securities to fund the student loans to term 
during each of the years ended december  and  the company completed four securitization transactions  in which a total of billion and billion of student loans  respectively  were securitized 
the company accounts for its securitization transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  which establishes the accounting for certain financial asset transfers  including securitization transactions 
under sfas  the company records an asset the interest residual and a gain on sale equal to the present value of the expected net cash flows from the trust to the company over the life of the portfolio securitized 
the gain is reduced by write offs of certain assets related to the portfolio sold and by transaction costs 
in addition  the company continues to service the loans in the trusts for a fee  and earns that fee over the life of the portfolio 
when the contract servicing fee is greater than current market servicing rates  the present value of such excess servicing fees is recognized as a servicing asset and amortized over the life of the portfolio serviced 
gains on sales of student loans for the years ended december   and  the company recorded pre tax securitization gains of million  million and million  respectively 
in the third quarter of  the company resolved litigation over whether the offset fee applied to securitized student loans  and as a result  the company reversed a pre tax million reserve of which million was accrued prior to and million was accrued in the first half of for offset fees accrued previously 
in the consolidated statements of income  million of the reserve reversal is included in the gain on sale of student loans for and million is included in servicing and securitization revenue 
if the company had recorded gains at the time of each securitization transaction without reserving for the offset fee  and pre tax gains would have been million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the gains in versus was mainly due to the securitization of billion less student loans in in the third and fourth quarters of  the company decided not to enter into securitization transactions due to the turbulence in the global financial markets 
during this period  treasury bill rates  to which the company s asset backed securities are indexed  fell relative to other market indices  causing the company s financing spreads to widen 
gains for the years ended december   and  measured as a percentage of the securitized portfolios  were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in the gains as a percentage of the securitized portfolios versus is due mainly to the inclusion of lower yielding consolidation loans in the portfolios of loans securitized in and to higher cost of funds offset by lower relative servicing costs due to the higher average balance of loans securitized 
the increase in gains for the year ended december  versus is mainly due to the securitization of billion more student loans in than in the gains  as a percentage of the securitized portfolio  were larger in than because the portfolios of loans securitized in had higher average borrower indebtedness and longer average lives than the portfolios 
gains on future securitizations will continue to vary depending on the size and the characteristics of the loan portfolios securitized and the funding costs prevailing in the securitization debt markets 
servicing and securitization revenue the following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue years ended december  servicing revenue less amortization of servicing asset securitization revenue total servicing and securitization revenue the increase in servicing revenue is mainly due to the increase in the average balance of securitized student loans to billion in  from billion in and billion in the increase in securitization revenue is mainly due to the increase in the average balance of the interest residual to million in from million in and million in also  the company s securitized loan portfolio benefits from declining treasury bill rates in a manner similar to the on balance sheet portfolio of student loans 
in  the decline in treasury bill rates enhanced securitization revenue by million which included the amortization of the upfront payments received for the sale of floor interest contracts of million 
other income exclusive of gains on sales of student loans and servicing and securitization income  other income totaled million in versus million in and million in other income mainly includes gains and losses on sales of investment securities  revenue the company receives from servicing the portfolio of student loans held by the company s joint venture with chase manhattan bank  commitment fees for letters of credit and late fees earned on student loans 
the increase in other income in versus and is due to higher servicing fees as the average balance of joint venture student loans serviced by the company increased to billion  up from billion in and million in see student loan purchases analysis for a discussion on the restructuring of the joint venture 
also  in the second half of the company began assessing late fees and earned million in versus none in and these increases in other income are somewhat offset by lower gains on sales of securities in operating expenses operating expenses include costs to service the company s managed student loan portfolio  operational costs incurred in the process of acquiring student loan portfolios  and general and administrative expenses

operating expenses in included one time costs of million incurred in for expenses and asset write downs in connection with the reorganization of the company to a privatized entity and the change in business strategies implemented by the new management 
together these one time costs account for of the basis points in during  the company closed two satellite servicing centers and reconfigured the remaining centers 
the company took a charge of million basis points of average managed student loans for the cost of these efforts 
the decreases in operating expenses in versus  exclusive of the one time charges  can be attributed to the effect of the company s restructuring of operations in the second half of and to management s continued commitment to control expenses 
in  operating expenses increased by million over the prior year 
as discussed above  the increase can be attributed to the one time  non recurring expenses of million relating to the reorganization of the gse and the restructuring of operations

interest earned on the interest residual and fees earned for servicing the loan portfolios are recognized over the life of the securitization transaction as servicing and securitization revenue 
under sfas  income recognition is effectively accelerated through the recognition of a gain at the time of sale while the ultimate realization of such income remains dependent on the actual performance  over time  of the loans that were securitized 
management believes that  in addition to results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap  another important performance measure is pro forma results of operations under the assumption that the securitization transactions are financings and that the securitized student loans were not sold 
the following pro forma statements of income present the company s results of operations under the assumption that the securitization transactions are treated as financings as opposed to sales of student loans 
as such  no gain on sale or subsequent servicing and securitization revenue is recognized 
instead  the earnings of the student loans in the trusts and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of loans 
management refers to these pro forma results as cash basis statements of income

offset fees 


student loan income cost of funds student loan spread average balances in millions of dollars student loans    the company generally finances its student loan portfolio with floating rate debt tied to the average of the day treasury bill auctions  either directly or through the use of derivative financial instruments  to mimic the interest rate characteristics of the student loans 
such borrowings  however  do not have minimum rates 
as a result  in periods of declining interest rates  the portfolio of managed student loans may be earning at the minimum borrower rate while the company s funding costs will generally decline along with treasury bill rates 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is fixed to term  declining interest rates may benefit the spread earned on student loans for extended periods of time 
for loans where the borrower s interest rate is reset annually  any benefit of a low interest rate environment will only enhance student loan spreads through the next annual reset of the borrowers interest rates  which occurs on july of each year 
assuming the decline in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt exactly matched the decline in treasury bill rates  then the effect of lower treasury bill rates in on the company s cash basis student loan spread  net of payments under floor interest contracts  was million  of which  million is attributable to student loans with minimum borrower rates fixed to term and million is attributable to student loans whose minimum borrower rate adjusts annually on july included in the cash basis student loan spread from loans with minimum borrower rates adjusting annually is the amortization of the upfront payments received on floor interest contracts discussed below 
on a cash basis  financing spreads  relative to the treasury bill  increased by 
percent in versus this was due to wider financing spreads in both the gse and securitization debt markets and to the higher percentage of student loan portfolios being funded by the company s asset backed securities 
the company s asset back securities have a higher cost of funds than the company s gse debt because they are term match funded and do not benefit from the gse s government sponsored status 
the higher funding costs on the company s asset backed securities is somewhat mitigated by the absence of offset fees on securitized loans 
the net effect of increased funding costs and offset fees in versus was million 
the 
percent decrease in the student loan spread in versus was due to the increase in treasury bill rates during that time  which reduced the spread earned on the company s student loans as financing costs increased while a significant portion of the managed student loan portfolio continued to earn at the minimum borrower rate 
also contributing to the decline in the spread were higher funding costs  as a greater percentage of the company s managed student loan portfolio was being funded by the company s asset backed securities and higher consolidation loan rebate fees 
for the years ended december   and  the amortization of the upfront payments received from the sale of floor interest contracts with annually reset borrower rates was million  million and million  respectively

cash basis net interest income in  net interest income  on a cash basis  was million compared with million in and million in the increase in net interest income in over is mainly due to the increase in the average balance of managed student loans  and the increase in student loans as a percentage of average earning assets 
the reduction in the average balance of the investment portfolio  academic facilities financings  and warehousing advances in versus and from versus reduced net interest income by million and million  respectively 
federal and state taxes the company maintains a portfolio of tax advantaged assets principally to support education related financing activities 
that portfolio was primarily responsible for the decrease in the effective federal income tax rate from the statutory rate of percent to percent in  percent in and percent in the gse is exempt from all state  local  and district of columbia income  franchise  sales and use  personal property and other taxes  except for real property taxes 
however  this tax exemption applies only to the gse and does not apply to slm holding or its other operating subsidiaries 
under the privatization act  the company s gse and non gse activities are separated  with non gse activities being subject to taxation at the state and local level 
state taxes were immaterial in as the majority of the company s business activities were conducted in the gse 
as increasing business activity occurs outside of the gse  the impact of state and local taxes will increase accordingly 
management expects that ultimately all business activities will occur outside of the gse  which could increase the company s effective income tax rate by as much as four percent 
the loss of the gse tax exemption for sales and use and personal property taxes could increase operating costs by one percent 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary requirements for capital are to fund the company s operations  its purchases of student loans and the repayment of its debt obligations while continuing to meet the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio test 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are through the debt issuances by the gse  off balance sheet financings through securitizations  cash generated by its subsidiaries operations and distributed through dividends to the company and bank borrowings 
the gse secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans  along with its other operations  by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets  through public offerings and private placements of us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics  and through securitizations of its student loans 
the gse s debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
historically  the rating agencies ratings of the gse have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise 
since the privatization act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the gse  management anticipates that the gse will retain its current credit ratings 
in addition to the gse debt  student loan securitization has been an increasing source of funding for the company s managed student loan portfolio since as student loans are securitized  the need for long term financing of these assets on balance sheet decreases 
over the long term  securitization is expected to provide the principal source of long term funding for the company s managed portfolio of student loans 
the company s unsecured financing requirements are driven by three principal factors refinancing of existing liabilities as they mature  financing of student loan portfolio growth  and the company s level of securitization activity 
as discussed under securitization program  the recent turmoil in the global financial markets has caused financing spreads in the asset backed market to widen 
until market conditions improve  management intends to continue to finance its student loan portfolio through unsecured gse debt issuances 
the uncertainty in the financial markets has also caused funding spreads on the company s unsecured debt to widen 
management believes that the current adverse spread environment is temporary  so  to mitigate its effect on the company s cost of funds  the company has been and will continue to meet its funding needs through short term financings 
should these market conditions persist over an extended period of time  the increased cost of the company s funding could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
during  the company used the proceeds from student loan securitizations of billion  repayments and claim payments on student loans of billion  and the net proceeds from sales or maturities of investments  warehousing advances and academic facility refinancings of billion to purchase student loans of billion  to reduce total debt by billion and to repurchase million of the company s common stock 
operating activities provided net cash inflows of million in  an increase of million from the net cash inflows of million in this increase was mainly attributable to the increase in net income exclusive of noncash gains on sale of student loans of million in versus during  the gse issued billion of long term notes to refund maturing and repurchased obligations 
at december   the gse had billion of outstanding long term debt issues of which billion had stated maturities that could be accelerated through call provisions 
the gse uses interest rate and foreign currency swaps collateralized where appropriate  purchases of us treasury securities and other hedging techniques to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations that arise from its financing activities and to match the variable interest rate characteristics of its earning assets 
see interest rate risk management 
slm holding maintains a million bank line of credit with a bank that expires on august  the line is being used to meet working capital needs  and at december   there was million outstanding under this line 
over the long term  securitization is expected to provide the principal source of long term funding for the company s managed portfolio of student loans 
to meet the need for short term financing for student loans prior to securitization  the company expects to begin implementing other forms of secured non gse financing such as asset backed commercial paper in such financings could require the company to obtain a bond rating  and such ratings will not be known until specific debt is issued 
it is expected that these ratings will be below the gse s current credit rating levels 
until the gse is dissolved  the privatization act places a number of limitations on the company 
under the privatization act  the gse must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before september  any gse debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust  consisting of us government or agency obligations with cash flows matching the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt 
the privatization act requires that on the dissolution date of september   the gse shall repurchase or redeem  or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock 
the company has the option of effecting an earlier dissolution of the gse if certain conditions are met 
also upon the gse s dissolution  all of its remaining assets will transfer to the company 
the privatization act effectively requires that the gse maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets plus percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items of at least percent until january  and percent thereafter or be subject to certain safety and soundness requirements designed to restore such statutory ratio 
management anticipates being able to fund the increase in required capital from the gse s current and retained earnings 
while the gse may not finance the activities of its non gse affiliates  it may  subject to its minimum capital requirements  dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to slm holding  which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non gse subsidiaries 
the privatization act requires management to certify to the secretary of the treasury that  after giving effect to the payment of dividends  the statutory capital ratio test would have been met at the time the dividend was declared 
at december   the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio  after the effect of the dividends to be paid in the first quarter of  was percent 
the privatization act imposes certain restrictions on inter company relations between the gse and its affiliates during the wind down period 
in particular  the gse must not extend credit to  nor guarantee  any debt obligations of slm holding or its non gse subsidiaries 
the privatization act provides that the gse may continue to issue new debt obligations maturing on or before september  the legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the gse s debt obligations  including securities and exchange commission sec registration and state tax exemptions  will be fully preserved until their respective maturities 
such debt obligations will remain gse debt obligations  whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of  or issued subsequent to  the reorganization 
the obligations of slm holding do not have gse status 
securitization management believes that securitization represents an efficient source of funding 
the company s asset backed securities abs generally have a higher cost of funds than its traditional on balance sheet financing because the abs securities are term match funded and do not benefit from the gse s government sponsored enterprise status 
however  the increased funding costs of the abs securities are mitigated by the absence of the offset fees on securitized loans 
securitization also allows the company to obtain term financing at a lower cost than otherwise would be achievable without the gse s government sponsored status 
securitizations to date have been structured to achieve an aaa credit rating on over percent of its securities sold with an a credit rating on the remaining subordinated securities 
in the third and fourth quarters of  the company decided not to enter into a securitization transaction 
the company s decision to defer selling loans through securitizations resulted from the turbulence in the global financial markets  during which treasury bill rates  to which the gse s asset backed securities are indexed  fell relative to other market indices  and the company s financing spreads widened 
management remains committed to the securitization program and will continue to securitize student loans when market conditions improve 
while management believes that the current market conditions are temporary  a prediction of when the securitization program will resume cannot be made at this time 
interest rate risk management interest rate gap analysis the company s principal objective in financing its operations is to minimize its sensitivity to changing interest rates by matching the interest rate characteristics of its borrowings to specific assets in order to lock in spreads 
the company funds its floating rate managed loan assets most of which have weekly rate resets with variable rate debt and fixed rate debt converted to variable rates with interest rate swaps 
the company also uses interest rate cap and collar agreements  foreign currency swaps  options on securities  and financial futures contracts to further reduce interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure on certain of its borrowings 
investments are funded on a pooled approach  ie  the pool of liabilities that funds the investment portfolio has an average rate and maturity or reset date that corresponds to the average rate and maturity or reset date of the investments which they fund 
in addition to term match funding  the company s abs securities generally match the interest rate characteristics of the majority of the student loans in the trusts by being indexed to the day treasury bill 
however  at december   there were approximately billion of plus student loans outstanding in the trusts  which have interest rates that reset annually based on the final auction of week treasury bills before each july the company manages this basis risk within the trusts through its on balance sheet financing activities 
the effect of this basis risk management is included in the following table as the impact of securitized student loans 
in the table below the company s variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by the reset date of the underlying index 
fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates 
an interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals 
the following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at december  and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period

the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of percent on the company s variable rate assets and liabilities and a hypothetical percent increase in spreads to their underlying index 
based on this analysis an increase in rates and spreads of this magnitude would reduce net income by approximately million or 
diluted earnings per share 
the decline in net income would be primarily due to the reduction on the spread earned on student loans as financing costs would increase while a significant portion of the company s student loan portfolio would continue to earn at the minimum borrower rate 
the fair value of the company s interest sensitive assets and its long term debt and hedging instruments are also subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
a separate analysis was performed to determine the effects of a hypothetical percent rise in market interest rates on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the effect of the percent rise in rates on fair values would be a decrease in the fair market value of student loans of approximately million  and a decrease in the fair market value of non student loan assets of approximately million 
the decrease in the fair market value of these assets would be partially offset by an increase in the fair market value of the company s long term debt and hedging instruments by million 
the net effect of a rise in rates on fair market values would therefore be a million decrease in net assets 
this decrease in the net asset market value from a rise in rates is mainly caused by the reduction in the student loan spread as a significant portion of the company s student loan portfolio would continue to earn at the minimum borrower interest rate while the related financing costs would be rising by 
these amounts have been determined after considering the impact of a hypothetical shift in interest rates and the use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments with no other changes in the company s financial structure 
the analysis is limited because it does not take into account the overall level of economic activity  other operating transactions and other management actions that could be taken to further mitigate the company s exposure to risk 
average terms to maturity the following table reflects the average terms to maturity for the company s managed earning assets and liabilities at december  average terms to maturity in years on off balance balance sheet sheet managed earning assets student loans warehousing advances academic facilities financings cash and investments total earning assets borrowings short term borrowings 

long term borrowings total borrowings in the above table  treasury receipts and variable rate asset backed securities  although generally liquid in nature  extend the weighted average remaining term to maturity of cash and investments to years 
as student loans are securitized  the need for long term on balance sheet financing will decrease 
common stock on january   the company effected a for stock split through a stock dividend of an additional five shares for every two owned 
in january of  the board of directors increased the common share repurchase authority by million shares bringing the total remaining authority to million shares

the reauthorization legislation lowers both the borrower interest rate on stafford loans to a formula based on the day treasury bill rate plus percent percent during in school and grace periods and the lender s rate after special allowance payments to the day treasury bill rate plus percent percent during in school and grace periods for loans originated on or after october  and before july  the borrower interest rate on plus loans originated during this period will be equal to the day treasury bill rate plus percent 
special allowance payments are also based on the day treasury bill rate plus percent 
these rate reductions were first introduced on an interim basis in temporary student loan legislation enacted into law on june  and effective for loans originated from july  through september  as a result of these earlier rate reductions  the company renegotiated certain contract provisions with some lenders  including  principally  price and or settlement timing provisions  under the student loan forward purchase commitments it has entered into with some of its lenders and is currently engaged in renegotiating these same contract provisions with other lenders 
however  there can be no assurance that as a result of such renegotiations the company will realize the same overall return under any such renegotiated commitment contracts with respect to student loans originated after july   as it has under the prior legislation with respect to the loans whose first disbursements occurred before july  the reauthorization legislation maintains interest rates for borrowers of federal direct consolidation loans whose applications for such loans were received prior to february  at percent percent during in school and grace periods  which rates are adjusted annually based on a formula equal to the day treasury bill rate plus percent percent during in school and grace periods 
the reauthorization legislation states that the borrower interest rates on federal direct consolidation loans for borrowers whose applications are received on or after february  and before july  is to be a fixed rate equal to the lesser of the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans consolidated  adjusted up to the nearest one eighth of one percent  and 
this is the same rate which the reauthorization legislation sets on ffelp consolidation loans for borrowers whose applications are received on or after october  and before july  the reauthorization legislation sets the special allowance payment rate for ffelp consolidation loans at the day treasury bill rate plus percent 
the annual fee paid by lenders on ffelp consolidation loans is reduced under the reauthorization legislation from percent to 
percent of the principal plus accrued unpaid interest on any such consolidation loans  applications for which are received on or after october  and before february  as a result of the reauthorization legislation  the company announced in the fourth quarter of that it will once again offer student loan borrowers the smart loan registered trademark consolidation program  which it suspended in the fourth quarter of the availability of the comparatively lower borrower interest rates at least prior to subsequent annual rate adjustments on federal direct consolidation loans made on or before january  may increase the likelihood that a ffelp student loan managed by the company will be prepaid from the proceeds of such loans during such four month period 
the company believes  however  that the likelihood of any such prepayment may be mitigated by the cost savings that borrowers may realize over federal direct consolidation loans under certain circumstances by enrolling in the company s smart rewards registered trademark program and direct repay sm plan during such four month period 
in connection with this legislation the company increased the provision for losses by million to provide for write offs for unusual loan prepayments at amounts less than carrying value 
as part of legislation reauthorizing various health profession education programs  the insurance on existing loans originated under the heal program was reduced from percent to percent of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest  unless the servicer of the heal loan qualifies as an exceptional performer  in which case claims would continue to be paid at the percent level 
management does not expect that the insurance reduction will have a material impact on the company s future financial results or condition 
administration s fy budget proposal on february  president clinton submitted his fiscal year budget proposal to congress 
the budget proposes significant savings from the student loan programs  principally from the ffelp 
among the proposals for student loans are the following reinstatement of a lower rate for new federal direct consolidation loans 
this variable rate the day treasury bill rate plus during repayment and during in school and grace periods would apply for borrowers whose applications are received before september  the budget proposals would also lower the annual fee paid by lenders on ffelp consolidation loans made during the same period from percent to 
percent of the principal plus accrued unpaid interest  creation of a day period during which interest on a highly delinquent ffelp loan does not accrue 
the reauthorization legislation extended the period before lenders can submit default claims from days to days  the budget proposes to eliminate interest accrual during this extended period  reduction by basis points of special allowance payments on ffelp loans funded with tax exempt securities  and implementation of additional guarantor reforms  including the acceleration of recall of guarantor reserves mandated by the reauthorization legislation  recall of an additional billion in reserves  the reduction of the guarantor retention rate on payments on defaulted loans to percent  the reduction in the share of the remaining amount that guarantors may retain  and an expansion of the use of voluntary flexible agreements authorized by the reauthorization legislation 
all these proposals may be considered by congress as it deliberates on the fy budget 
year issue the year issue refers to a wide variety of potential computer program processing and functionality issues that may arise from the inability of computer programs to properly process date sensitive information relating to the year  years thereafter and to a lesser degree the year the company s state of readiness during  the company commenced a year readiness project to assess and remediate its internal software and hardware systems to avoid or mitigate year problems and to evaluate year problems that may arise from entities with which the company interacts 
in  a comprehensive project structure was implemented and a year project team was formed 
the year project team briefs senior executives of the company and the company s board of directors on the progress of the year effort 
the company s year readiness project encompasses the company s information technology it systems  as well as its non it systems  such as systems embedded in its office equipment and facilities 
the company has completed the assessment of its internal software and hardware 
on december st the company achieved year readiness for all sallie mae internal applications that were scheduled to complete by with the completion of this critical milestone  the corporation is directing its attention to project objectives 
these objectives include the completion of exceptions 
a exception refers to those vendor supplied applications whose readiness date did not align with the company s december  readiness date 
these products will be upgraded upon the vendor distribution of any year ready release in  or  if no such release is issued  replaced with a year ready alternative 
additional objectives include year readiness testing with our external business partners and the development of year contingency and business continuity plans 
the company s year readiness project is divided into five phases awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the awareness phase  which is percent complete  involved the dissemination of year information throughout the company and the education of all levels of management about year issues and their potential impact on the company s operation 
the assessment phase  which is also percent complete  involved a comprehensive inventory of and the determination of the requirements for fixes  upgrades and replacements for all hardware  application software  embedded systems eg  the microcontrollers in the company s elevators and desktop applications 
the remediation phase  the year project phase where hardware  systems and applications are fixed  upgraded or replaced to be year ready  is percent complete for applications scheduled to complete in testing  the phase in which year remediation is validated  is also percent complete for all applications scheduled to complete in as part of this testing effort  the company staged a year disaster recovery exercise in august finally  production installations have been completed for all of the company s core applications 
the following describes the company s state of readiness with respect to the it systems that support the company s core business loan delivery and acquisition and loan servicing class sm  the company s consolidated loan administration and servicing system  is the system that services the company s managed student loans and the student loan portfolios of our portss registered trademark and transportss sm clients 
in july  remediation of class was completed and it was installed into production 
a second  full round of comprehensive functional testing and integration testing of all internal application interfaces with class was completed in december testing of external interfaces is scheduled to be completed in sallienet  the company s translation and communication system used to electronically exchange data with our customers  completed remediation in september and was installed into production in october sallienet successfully completed integration testing with class in december portss registered trademark iii  the company s pc based system used by lenders to originate loans  was developed in to be year ready 
minor remediation was completed on portss iii in mid october integration testing is complete and a year ready version of the software has been distributed to our customers 
liness sm  the company s pc based product used by colleges and universities to process financial aid loan application information  was developed in to be year ready 
the liness disbursement component used to transmit disbursement roster information from sallie mae s class system to the college or university  was developed in to be year ready 
liness utilizes the industry approved commonline sm formats for all communications 
minor remediation on liness was completed in mid october integration testing is complete and a year ready version of the software has been distributed to our customers 
imdoc registered trademark  the company s document imaging system  has completed remediation and functional testing and successfully completed integration testing with class in december in addition  certain significant financial and administrative systems  including the company s payroll and human resources  debt accounting  investment management and financial accounting and control systems have all completed remediation and have successfully completed integration testing with other internal systems 
the company s non it systems principally support the company s facilities and telecommunications 
as of october  all of the company s headquarters core facilities systems  including elevators  internal security and fire alarms  were determined to be year ready in accordance with the procedures established by the company to make such a determination 
the company completed year readiness testing of its lucent telecommunications components in december in addition  the company is working closely with all of its utility providers to make a reasonable assessment of the company s potential exposure to any failure on their part to resolve their year issues 
although the company s reston  virginia headquarters building is equipped with five emergency powered generators designed to back up building power without refueling for a period of two weeks  there can be no assurance that such back up systems will adequately insulate the company from any business interruptions caused by any widespread power outages or power outages in any service area where its loan servicing centers are located 
the company has surveyed its third party service providers and business partners and is currently reviewing these surveys 
in addition to requesting readiness information  the company has tested all third party developed software that the vendor claimed was year ready  to confirm compliance or determine the potential impact of noncompliance 
in addition  the company plans to work with select third party service providers and business partners to ascertain their current year compliance status and to coordinate testing efforts throughout there can be no assurance that the computer systems of other companies or counterparties on which the company relies will be year ready on a timely basis  or that a failure to resolve year issues by another party  or remediation or conversion that is incompatible with the company s computer systems  will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the risks of the company s year issues generally  the failure by the company or any of its significant third party service providers or business partners to resolve a material year issue could result in the interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations such as servicing loans or processing payments 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
for example  the company submits claims for payment  including special allowance payments and interest subsidy payments  directly to the us department of education the doe 
to the extent that the doe is unable to timely process the payments because of its failure to remediate its year problem  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected  possibly to a material extent 
in addition  the company submits claims to various state or private nonprofit guarantee agencies for payment of all or a portion of the unpaid principal balance on loans plus accrued interest if a borrower defaults on a student loan and in certain other circumstances such as the death  permanent or total disability of or the filing for bankruptcy by the borrower 
the company has surveyed each of the guarantee agencies and 
continues to make 
follow up telephone inquiries to determine the level of their year compliance and the potential impact of noncompliance 
to the extent that any of the larger guarantee agencies are unable to timely process the payments because of its failure to remediate its year problem  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected  possibly to a material extent 
the costs to address the company s year issues costs to modify computer systems have been  and will continue to be  expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s future financial results or condition 
the company spent approximately million in  million in and expects to spend approximately million in on this project 
in addition  year readiness has been addressed and accounted for as part of the costs of routine systems development and modification 
moreover  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
the company s contingency plans the company has developed high level contingency plans for its core applications and will refine these plans in in addition  the company intends to commit resources in to evaluate and prepare contingency plans for systems and operations viewed as vulnerable to year related interruptions 
there can be no assurance that the company s remediation efforts and contingency plans will be sufficient to avoid unforeseen business disruptions or other problems resulting from the year issue
