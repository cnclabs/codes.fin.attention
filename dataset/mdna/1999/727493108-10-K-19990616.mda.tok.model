item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information appearing under the caption management s discussion and analysis appearing at pages through of our annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by this reference 
risk factors affecting future operating results investors or potential investors in the stock of plantronics should carefully consider the risks described below 
the business  financial condition and results of operations of plantronics could be materially adversely affected if any of the risks occur 
if the risks occur  the trading price of plantronics stock could decline and an investor could lose all or part of his or her investment 
dependence on call center market segment we have historically derived  and continue to derive  a substantial majority of our net sales from the call center market segment 
this market segment has grown significantly in recent years as new call centers have proliferated and existing call centers have expanded 
while we believe this market segment is continuing to grow  in the future this growth could slow or revenues from this market segment could decline due to various factors 
for example  technological advances such as automated interactive voice response systems could reduce or eliminate the need for call center agents in certain applications 
in addition  consumer resistance to telemarketing could adversely affect growth in the call center market segment 
due to our reliance on the call center market segment  we will be affected more by changes in the rate of call center establishment and expansion and the communications products that call center agents use than would a company serving a broader market 
we believe that our sales growth in fiscal may have been favorably affected by call centers upgrading their automatic call distribution systems in order to be year compliant 
since our products are sometimes bundled with new call distribution systems  this may have accelerated some headset sales 
if this has occurred  it could adversely affect our net sales in future periods  once call centers have completed their system upgrades 
any decrease in the demand for call centers and related headset products could cause a decrease in the demand for our products  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure of the office  mobile  computer and residential market segments to develop while the call center market segment is still the most significant part of our business  we believe that our future prospects will depend in large part on the growth in demand for headsets in the office  mobile  computer and residential market segments 
these communications headset market segments are relatively new and undeveloped 
moreover  we do not have extensive experience in selling headset products to customers in these market segments 
if the demand for headsets in these market segments fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we currently anticipate  or if we are unable to effectively market our products to customers in these market segments  it would have a material adverse effect on the potential demand for our products and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future for a variety of reasons  including the following changes in demand for our products  timing and size of orders from customers  cancellations or delays of deliveries of components and subassemblies by our suppliers  variances in the timing and amount of engineering and operating expenses  distribution channel volume variations  delays in shipments of our products  product returns and customer credits  new product introductions by us or our competitors  entrance of new competitors  increases in the costs of our components and subassemblies  price erosion  changes in the mix of products sold by us  seasonal fluctuations in demand  and general economic conditions 
each of the above factors is difficult to forecast and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we generally ship most orders during the quarter in which they are received  and  consequently  we do not have a significant backlog of orders 
as a result  quarterly net sales and operating results depend primarily on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
it is difficult to forecast orders for a given quarter 
since a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  salaries and certain manufacturing expenses  are fixed and difficult to reduce or modify  if net sales do not meet our expectations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results can also vary substantially in any period depending on the mix of products sold and the distribution channels through which they are sold 
in the event that sales of lower margin products or sales through lower margin distribution channels in any period represent a disproportionate share of total sales during such period  our operating results would be materially adversely affected 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future operating results 
in addition  our operating results in a future quarter or quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  and  as a result  the price of our common stock might fall 
we must match production to demand historically  we have seen steady increases in customer demand for our products and have generally been able to increase production to meet that demand 
however  the demand for our products is dependent on many factors and such demand is inherently difficult to forecast 
significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following operating problems  among others if demand increases beyond that forecasted  we would have to rapidly increase production 
we depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and subassemblies  and  therefore  might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand 
this could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations 
there could be short term losses of sales while we are trying to increase production 
if customers turn to competitive sources of supply to meet their needs  there could be a long term impact on our revenues 
rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for components and subassemblies and higher overtime costs and other expenses 
these higher expenditures could lower our profit margins 
further  if production is increased rapidly  there may be decreased manufacturing yields  which may also lower our margins 
if forecasted demand does not develop  we could have excess production or excess capacity 
excess production could result in higher inventories of finished products  components and subassemblies 
if we were unable to sell these inventories  we would have to write off some or all of our inventories of obsolete products and unusable components and subassemblies 
excess manufacturing capacity could lead to higher production costs and lower margins 
any of the foregoing problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our suppliers we buy components and subassemblies from a variety of suppliers and assemble them into finished products 
the cost  quality  and availability of such components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products 
obtaining components and subassemblies entails various risks  including the following prices of components and subassemblies may rise 
if this occurs and we are not able to pass these increases on to our customers or to achieve operating efficiencies that would offset the increases  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we obtain certain subassemblies and components from single suppliers  and alternate sources for these items are not readily available 
to date  we have experienced only minor interruptions in the supply of these components and subassemblies  none of which has significantly affected our results of operations 
however  an interruption in supply from any of our single source suppliers in the future would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to provide us with components and subassemblies 
rather  we buy most components and subassemblies on a purchase order basis 
if our suppliers experience increased demand or shortages  it could affect deliveries to us 
in turn  this would affect our ability to manufacture and sell products that are dependent on those components and subassemblies 
this would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the headset market is highly competitive the market for our products is highly competitive 
we compete with a variety of companies in various segments of the communications headset market 
in the call center segment  the largest market segment in which we compete  our two largest competitors  gn netcom and acs wireless  inc  merged to form a single company 
although it is unclear how this merger will affect us  the merged entity will have a broader product offering and greater marketing presence than either of the two entities had separately 
moreover  the economies of scale that may result from the merger could lead to increased pricing pressures in our market 
we also anticipate that we will face additional competition from companies that currently do not offer communications headsets 
this is particularly true in the office  mobile  computer and residential market segments 
as these market segments mature  we will face increased competition from consumer electronics companies and other companies that currently manufacture and sell mobile phones or computer peripheral equipment 
these new competitors are likely to be larger  offer broader product lines  bundle or integrate with other products communications headset tops and bases manufactured by them or others  offer products containing bases that are incompatible with our headset tops and have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we believe that important competitive factors for us are product reliability  product features  customer service and support  reputation  distribution  ability to meet delivery schedules  warranty terms  product life and price 
if we do not compete successfully with respect to any of these or other factors it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully develop and market products that compete successfully with those of our competitors it would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new product development is risky  we must respond to changing customer requirements and technologies our product development efforts historically have been directed toward enhancement of existing products and development of new products that capitalize on our core capabilities 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including the proper selection of new product features  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  cost effective manufacture of such products  quality of new products and market acceptance 
to be successful in the future  we must develop new products  qualify these new products  successfully introduce these products to the market on a timely basis  and commence and sustain low cost  volume production to meet customers demands 
although we attempt to determine the specific needs of headset users in our target market segments  because almost all of our sales are indirect  we may not always be able to timely and accurately predict end user requirements 
as a result  our products may not be timely developed  designed to address current or future end user requirements  offered at competitive prices or accepted  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we generally incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a new product can be ascertained 
accordingly  revenues from new products may not be sufficient to recover the associated development costs 
historically  the technology used in lightweight communications headsets has evolved slowly 
new products have primarily offered stylistic changes and quality improvements  rather than significant new technologies 
we anticipate that the technology used in hands free communications devices  including our products  will begin to evolve more rapidly in the future 
we believe that this is particularly true of the office  mobile and residential market segments  which may require us to develop new headset technologies to support cordless and wireless operation and to interface with new communications and computing devices 
as a result  our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing market requirements  and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments 
if we are unable to develop and introduce enhanced products or new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  it will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our distribution channels we sell substantially all of our products through distributors  oems  retailers and telephony service providers 
our existing relationships with these parties are nonexclusive and can be terminated by either party without cause 
our channel partners also sell or can potentially sell products offered by our competitors 
to the extent that our competitors offer our channel partners more favorable terms  such partners may decline to carry  de emphasize or discontinue carrying our products 
in the future  we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified channel partners 
further  such partners may not recommend  or continue to recommend  our products 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors  oems  retailers and telephony service providers or to expand our distribution channels could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we depend on s 
kenneth kannappan and other key personnel our success depends to a significant extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees 
on january   s 
kenneth kannappan was promoted to chief executive officer of our company  succeeding robert s 
cecil in that capacity  and was appointed to our board of directors 
mr 
kannappan joined our company in february and has held a number of executive management positions  including president and chief operating officer 
the unanticipated loss of the services of mr 
kannappan or one or more of our other executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and  our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
citicorp venture capital retains significant control our largest stockholder  citicorp venture capital  ltd 
cvc  beneficially owns  shares of our common stock excluding any shares that may be owned by employees of cvc or its affiliates  which represents approximately of our outstanding common stock as of june  we also have an agreement with cvc under which it is entitled to have up to three of its designees serve on our board of directors  depending on the level of cvc s continuing stock ownership 
messrs 
robert f 
b 
logan  m 
saleem muqaddam and john mowbray o mara are currently serving as cvc s designees under that agreement 
accordingly  cvc has the ability to exert substantial influence on the full board of directors  which currently consists of seven members 
in addition  our bylaws contain provisions that require a two thirds supermajority vote of the board of directors to approve certain transactions  including amendments of our certificate of incorporation  certain provisions of our bylaws  mergers and sales of substantial assets  acquisitions of other companies and sales of capital stock 
these provisions may have the effect of giving a small number of directors the ability to block such transactions 
future sales of our common stock as of june   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
all of these shares are freely tradable except for approximately  shares held by affiliates of plantronics 
these approximately  shares may only be sold in reliance on rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  or pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
some of our current stockholders  including cvc  citigroup foundation and certain of our officers  directors and key employees  also have certain contractual rights to require plantronics to register their shares for public sale 
an additional approximately  shares are subject to outstanding stock options as of june  mrs 
louise cecil holds vested options on  shares of our common stock assigned to her by her husband robert s 
cecil and has in place an effective registration statement filed with the securities exchange commission  which allows her to sell any or all of such shares at any time without reliance upon rule sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market by cvc  mrs 
cecil  or any of our officers  directors or other stockholders could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities 
risks associated with our foreign operations approximately of our net sales in both fiscal and fiscal were derived from customers outside the united states 
in addition  we conduct substantially all of our headset assembly operations in our manufacturing facility located in mexico  and we obtain most of the components and subassemblies used in our products from various foreign suppliers 
the inherent risks of international operations  particularly in mexico  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the types of risks faced in connection with international operations and sales include cultural difference in the conduct of business  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  economic and political conditions in each country  management and operation of an enterprise spread over various countries  and burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates creates risk to us in both the sale of our products and our purchase of supplies 
fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
although we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to mitigate exchange rate risks  we continually evaluate programs to reduce our foreign currency exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience currency losses in the future  nor can we predict the effects of future exchange rate fluctuations on future operating results 
to the extent that sales to our foreign customers increase or transactions in foreign currencies increase  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  we cannot predict the potential consequences to our business of the adoption of the euro as a common currency in europe 
we depend on our principal manufacturing facility substantially all of our manufacturing operations are currently performed in a single facility in tijuana  mexico 
a fire  flood or earthquake  political unrest or other disaster or condition affecting our facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have developed a disaster recovery plan and believe we are adequately insured with respect to this facility  we may not be able to implement the plan effectively or on a timely basis or recover under applicable insurance policies 
failure of electronic systems to recognize the year many existing electronic systems  including computer systems  use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these systems may recognize a date using as rather than the year if not corrected  many computer and other electronic applications and systems could fail or create erroneous results when addressing dates on and after january  our products do not address or utilize dates in their operation  and  accordingly  our products should not fail due to the year problem 
however  we use and depend on information technology systems including business information computer systems and design and manufacturing computer systems and other machinery and equipment that includes embedded date sensitive technology 
we also depend on the proper functioning of date sensitive electronic systems of third parties  such as customers and suppliers 
the failure of any of these systems to appropriately interpret the year could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are undertaking efforts to ensure that our business systems and those of our suppliers and customers are compliant with the requirements of the year you should refer to the section titled year in the annual report to stockholders for a more complete discussion of our year compliance efforts 
however  our year program may not be effective or we may not be able to implement it in a timely and cost effective manner 
our year efforts may not  therefore  ensure against disruptions caused by the approach or advent of the year the year problem is potentially very widespread  and it is not possible to determine all the potential risks that we may face 
our inability to remedy our own year problems or the failure of third parties to do so may cause business interruptions or shutdowns  financial loss  regulatory actions  harm to our reputation and exposure to liability 
risks of inadequate protection of intellectual property and infringement of rights of others our success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent  trademark  trade secret  and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we currently hold thirty four united states patents and additional foreign patents and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when we believe it to be appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be lengthy and expensive 
patents may not be issued in response to our applications  and patents that are issued may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged by others 
if we are required to enforce our patents or other proprietary rights through litigation  the costs and diversion of management s attention could be substantial 
in addition  the rights granted under any patents may not provide us competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights 
moreover  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property rights  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights against us 
such claims  if they are asserted  could result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention 
in addition  we may not ultimately prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from such third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability exposure the use of our products exposes us to the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims have in the past been  and are currently being  asserted against us 
none of the previously resolved claims have materially affected our business  financial condition or results of operations  nor do we believe that any of the pending claims will have such an effect 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage provided under our policies could be unavailable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any such claim 
therefore  successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  the loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendation by securities analysts  developments in our industry  sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market  general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performances of such companies 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those governing the use  discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process 
although we believe that our current manufacturing operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental legislation has been enacted and may in the future be enacted or interpreted to create environmental liability with respect to our facilities or operations 
we have included in our financial statements a reserve of million for possible environmental remediation of the site of one of our previous businesses 
while no claims have been asserted against us in connection with this matter  such claims could be asserted in the future and any liability that might result could exceed the amount of the reserve 
effects of antitakeover provisions our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting and conversion rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  we are subject to the antitakeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party 
further  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
