results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented the percentages of revenues represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the last three fiscal years 
these percentages have been recalculated to give effect to the discontinuation of the rf business segment in and the acquisition of ti in year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development costs move and relocation charges total operating costs operating loss gain on sale of assets other income expense net interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations before minority interest minority interest loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations and gain on sale in net loss results of continuing operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues decreased to  in  from  in the decrease of  was primarily in product revenues 
in  the company benefited from a million product sale to a customer in southeast asia that was fully recognized as revenue in during  the company refocused its sales efforts to latin and south america  africa and the middle east in an effort to recover momentum in the business 
in addition  in  the company renegotiated its long term service contract with its mexican partner resulting in approximately  of revenue in the third quarter of and generated revenues of approximately  from its venezuelan altair joint venture 
these refocused efforts resulted in the company generating revenues of  in the fourth quarter of compared to  in the fourth quarter of the company believes that the diversion of management attention to the setting up of the dtpi service business especially in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as well as the asian financial crisis  in general  are the primary reasons for the decline in product revenues in compared to product revenues in asia decreased to  in from  in the increase in service revenue in compared to relates to service revenues generated by the company s dtpi long term service business  which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of however  approximately  of such service revenues were from the company s mexican partner see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s mexican partner is experiencing financial difficulties at present and it is uncertain if the company will generate any future revenues from this customer 
as a result of the asian financial crisis  as well as the economic instability in latin america and the other developing regions of the world which comprise the company s primary market  the company s revenues for were not as high as anticipated and the company incurred a substantial loss in as a result of the continuing economic instability in asia and latin america  the company expects to experience a substantial decrease in revenues for the first quarter of compared with the corresponding period in and the level of revenues for the second quarter of is uncertain 
the company is in the process of reducing its operating costs to a level that is commensurate with such lower expected revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully align its expenses with its revenue or that revenue will not decline faster than the reduction in expenses 
the company expects to incur a substantial loss for the quarter ended march   primarily as a result of a decrease in revenues 
the expected loss for the quarter ended march   will also be adversely impacted by a restructuring charge associated with the company s cost reduction efforts as well as a charge associated with the currency devaluation in brazil  which adversely affected the company s receivables from two customers and certain cash balances 
while the contracts relating to such receivables contain provisions that call for payments to be adjusted to take into account fluctuations in foreign currency rates  the company s customers have expressed an unwillingness to adjust contract amounts to fully reflect the exchange rate fluctuation 
brazilian counsel has advised the company that there is uncertainty as to the enforceability of provisions which tie payments to foreign currency rates 
the company  therefore  has reached a settlement with one customer and is currently in the process of negotiating a settlement of its receivables from another of its brazilian customers 
the company s currency exposure in brazil is also exacerbated by the brazilian exchange control rules  which limit the company s ability to repatriate its brazilian currency 
as of april   the company s cash assets included approximately million in brazil based on the exchange rates as of such date 
while the company is in the process of repatriating such funds  there can be no assurance that such process will be completed in a timely fashion or that the company will not suffer additional losses as a result of the brazilian currency fluctuation 
in addition  the company expects that its future sales projects in brazil may be adversely impacted by the recent brazilian currency devaluation since the effective price that brazilian customers would pay for the company s products and services will be higher 
the company s results for will also be materially impacted by the ability of dtpi s service partner to raise funding to meet its obligations to dtpi 
in  the company generated approximately  of revenue from its mexican partner 
the inability of the company s mexican partner to date to raise additional funding for continuing operations has  in the company s opinion  made it unlikely that the company s mexican partner will be able to meet its contractual obligation to purchase a minimum of million of equipment from dtpi over the course of the next two years 
gross profit decreased to of revenues in compared to in the decrease to in relates to inventory reserves of approximately  established in and direct costs associated with the dtpi business of approximately  that did not exist in due to dtpi only commencing operations in the fourth quarter of the inventory reserves were for i inventory obsolescence associated with an earlier version of the company s products  ii certain items that are considered excess to requirements and  iii reserves considered necessary for product on long term loan to certain customers 
the product gross profit percentage is comparable year on year when adjusted for the inventory reserves 
the service gross profit decreased from in to a negative and reflects the direct infrastructure costs of establishing dtpi as well as a  impairment reserve established against certain gateway equipment associated with the company s mexican partner where there is an impairment of the carrying value of revenue generating assets  due to the mexican partner currently experiencing financial difficulties 
selling  general and administrative expenses in were  compared to  in measured as a percent of revenues  these expenses increased to in as compared to in the dollar increase of  in compared to reflects increased costs of approximately  relating to dtpi that did not exist in the prior year and other general increases in costs including bad debt reserves  rent on the company s new atlanta facility with associated administrative overhead and an increased number of sales personnel 
the increase in percentage terms reflects the relatively fixed nature of such costs irrespective of the level of revenues 
research and development costs were  in as compared to  in measured as a percent of revenues  these costs increased to in as compared to in the dollar increase was due to expenditures for personnel and outside services in support of the company s continuing new product development efforts for the space phone and spaceweb and to an expense of approximately  for a contractually committed research and development project with no discernible future benefit that was recognized in the move and relocation charges of  in primarily comprised severance  relocation and move costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of the company s network systems division in georgia 
the gain on sale of assets of  in represented a gain net of costs and reserves considered necessary on the sale of the company s majority owned subsidiary  tmsi 
the reserves established primarily related to exposures to litigation  intellectual property indemnifications  customer concessions  license fees and management bonuses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income increased by  to  in  compared to the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash deposits being maintained by the company as a result of the issuance of shares for cash by both stm and dtpi  the sale of the assets of tmsi  the receipt of cash from the revised long term service agreement in mexico and higher level of bank borrowings in compared to interest expense increased by  to  in compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in short term borrowings from banks compared to when the company partially financed its working capital requirements by discounting letters of credit from customers at a lower cost 
the tax provision of  in  compared to a tax benefit of  in  reflects the write off of the company s deferred tax assets at december   due to uncertainty concerning the ability to realize such assets as a result of the company experiencing continued losses and a tax provision of  established for tax exposures in brazil 
the minority interest charge relates to accrued dividends on the mandatory redeemable shares issued in march  by dtpi see note to the consolidated financial statements  offset by a credit associated with tmsi s minority interest in the first quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased to  in from  in  a increase  primarily as a result of the revenue earned under a million equipment supply contract with a customer in thailand 
approximately million of revenues were recognized under this equipment supply agreement and these revenues were recognized throughout the year primarily in quarters through of the company earned approximately  from the same customer in thailand in under another contract 
the decline in service revenues to  in compared to  in reflected a lower service content in revenues that can occur  depending upon the nature of the contracts that the company enters into in any given period 
the company s focus on larger value sales exposed the company to a concentration of revenues to individual customers and in geographic regions as evidenced by the decline in revenues in the million equipment supply contract in increased this concentration of revenues 
in recognition of this  in the company s sales and marketing activities have been increased to broaden coverage in the company s selected markets 
gross profits increased to of revenues in from in excluding approximately  of inventory obsolescence reserves included in cost of revenues in  the adjusted gross profit percentage for would have been approximately 
the decline in the gross profit in reflected a relatively lower gross profit percentage earned by the company on the million equipment supply sale to the customer in thailand and a lower gross profit percentage due to product mix in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses in were  compared to  in measured as a percent of revenues  these expenses decreased to in as compared to in the expense included approximately  associated with customer concessions and allowances 
excluding this  from the expense  the adjusted selling  general and administrative expenses would have been  or of revenues  compared to for the decrease in percentage terms in reflected the relatively fixed nature of certain costs that did not increase in proportion to the increase in revenues 
the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to adjusted for the  previously discussed reflected increased costs  primarily to support the growth in revenue in both the core manufacturing business and the system integration business 
research and development expenses were  in compared to  in measured as a percent of revenues  these expenses decreased to in as compared to in adjusting the expense for  of non recurring engineering charges associated with a product that the company does not expect to sell in significant numbers and was fully expensed in  research and development expenses in would have increased by  or over the comparable expense 
this dollar increase was due to planned expenditures for personnel and outside services in support of the company s continuing new product development efforts 
in percentage terms  the adjusted expenses represented of revenues 
the decrease in percentage terms in was due to the relatively fixed nature of certain costs that did not increase in proportion to the increase in revenues 
the income tax benefit for was  as compared to  in the decrease in the income tax benefit in compared to related to a lower loss in compared to and the company reviewing the level of deferred tax assets existing at december  for realizability due to the company incurring losses for both and the minority interest of  and  in and respectively  represented the share of the losses of tmsi attributable to the minority shareholders

results of discontinued operations for  revenues for rf were  net income was  and the gain on sale in was  liquidity and capital resources in connection with the award of certain long term service contracts in mexico and venezuela  which require initial capital investments by the company to enable the company to render such services and other contracts that dtpi may be awarded in the future  the company continues to review financing alternatives to enable it to pursue these business opportunities in the most beneficial manner 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company

in connection with the company s short term borrowings see note to the company s consolidated financial statements under a secured  revolving line of credit with wells fargo hsbc trade bank na guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states exim under its working capital guarantee program collectively  the bank  the company was not in compliance with certain covenants at december  in addition  the line of credit expired on april  with the current borrowings at  on april   the company received a demand letter from the bank  in which the bank threatened to pursue all available alternatives  including commencing foreclosure proceedings on its collateral  if all outstanding amounts were not paid by the company within ten days 
the company is currently in discussions with the bank with respect to a six month forbearance agreement and expects to make suitable arrangements with the bank prior to the expiration of the ten day period in the demand letters 
the forbearance agreement will require the company to give the bank  amongst other things  additional collateral including a second deed of trust on the company s corporate headquarters  a pledge of stock of and guarantees from all the company s domestic and foreign subsidiaries except dtpi  a pledge of the note receivable from dtpi see note to the consolidated financial statements and an assignment of the company s patents  trademarks and leasehold interests 
the forbearance agreement will also reduce the advance rates against inventory and accounts receivable balances and will require a permanent paydown of the line of credit should the company sell its corporate headquarters or should dtpi repay the note to stm out of the proceeds of future financings 
there can no assurance that the company will reach agreement with the bank for this forbearance agreement  nor  that should the company reach agreement with the bank  that there will not be another event of default during the forbearance period 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient eligible foreign orders  inventory and accounts receivable balances to enable the company to continue to borrow at its current level 
should the company not reach agreement with the bank or should the company experience an event of default under the forbearance agreement or should the company not have sufficient eligibility to continue to borrow at its existing levels  the company may be required to paydown either all or a portion of the line of credit and dispose of certain assets to satisfy obligations to the bank 
in addition  the company will incur substantial losses in the first quarter of due to low revenues and foreign exchange losses arising form the devaluation of the brazilian real 
furthermore  the level of revenues that the company will earn in the second quarter of and future quarters is uncertain 
the company has implemented certain cost saving measures and is reviewing other alternatives to improve the performance of the business 
in order for the company to meet its working capital requirements  the company may be required to seek additional funds through debt or equity financings in order to provide sufficient working capital for the company 
the company believes that such alternative sources of financing are available to meet its anticipated cash requirements in the next months 
the issuance of additional equity securities by the company could result in substantial dilution to the stockholders 
if the company incurs additional debt  the company s increased leverage may affect its ability to raise capital in the future and may limit its flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions

year many computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this poses a problem at the end of the century because such computer programs would not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of 
this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year issue 
the company has formulated a year plan to address the company s year issues and has created a year task force to implement the year plan 
the company s year plan has seven phases  which are as follows phase organizational awareness  which entails educating employees  senior management and the board of directors about the yk problem and how to deal with it  phase inventory and supply management  which entails taking a complete inventory of systems and their relative priority to continuing operation and implementing a supply management process for top vendors and critical components  phase assessment  which entails assessing systems and their yk compliance status  phase planning  which entails preparing an estimate of cost and identifying potential solutions and their cost in dollars  schedule and ripple effect  phase renovation  which entails implementation of fixes  phase validation  which entails testing the fixes for compliance  and phase contingency planning  which entails preparing for rollover staffing  inventory adjustment and other actions which would mitigate the effect of a yk failure 
the company s year plan will be applied in five different areas of coverage a internal systems  b current products  c vendors  d existing customers  and e key business partners 
internal systems 
the company s internal business systems and pc applications will be a primary area of focus 
the company is currently evaluating its software applications  including  but not limited to  its business systems software  personal computers  computerized manufacturing equipment and embedded chips to identify any year issues that could significantly disrupt the company s operations 
the company has completed the inventory and assessment phase of substantially all critical systems 
the planning  renovation and validation phases are scheduled to be completed by september  with the exception of a scheduled upgrade to the companies infoflow business management software system  upgrades primarily consist of implementing free bug patches or planned software upgrades to current versions 
the company expects to be year compliant on all critical systems which rely on the calendar year before december  some non critical systems may not be addressed until after january  however  the company believes such systems will not disrupt the company s operations significantly 
current products 
the company s certification group has conducted evaluations of its current products to determine if they are year compliant 
the company does not currently believe that there are any material year defects in its products 
with respect to components in the company s products that are manufactured by third parties  the company has completed the inventory and assessment phase and does not currently believe that there are any material year defects 
vendors 
the company has completed the inventory phase and is currently in the assessment phase with respect to the year status of critical suppliers 
the company has contacted the top of critical suppliers  and has completed over of the assessment phase with no serious risks discovered 
the company does not currently believe that any year compliance issues related to its suppliers will result in a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
existing customers 
with respect to products that have been shipped to existing customers  the company has identified certain problems that will require upgrades to operational networks to make them year compliant 
the company is in the process of contacting its customers to notify them of such problems and expects to complete all necessary upgrades by september  the company currently estimates that the total cost of implementing such upgrades will not exceed million and will likely be offset by service fees charged in connection with completing such upgrades 
the company believes that a small portion of the upgrades will be provided free of charge as part of the warranty coverage or software maintenance agreements on the products being upgraded 
key business partners 
the company has completed the inventory phase with respect to its key business partners  and currently is in the assessment phase with over completion to date 
the company has not identified any areas where the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
contingency plan 
the company has not formulated a contingency plan at this time but expects to have a contingency plan in place prior to january  the company currently estimates that the cost of implementing its year plan will not exceed million including the cost of upgrading the operational networks of current customers 
the company anticipates that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
there can be no assurances  however  that the systems of other companies or governmental entities  on which the company relies for supplies  cash payments  and future business  will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company or the governmental entities  would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
if third party service providers and vendors  due to the year issue  fail to provide the company with components or materials which are necessary to manufacture its products  with sufficient electrical power and other utilities to sustain its manufacturing process  or with adequate  reliable means of transporting its products to its customers worldwide  then any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct business  as well as the company s financial position and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to avoid the risk of fluctuating exchange rates associated with international sales  the company conducts most international sales in united states currency 
however  the company has generated  and expects to continue generating  a significant portion of its brazilian revenue in the local currency of brazil 
while the contracts relating to such arrangements generally contain provisions that call for payments to be adjusted to take into account fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company s customers in brazil have expressed an unwillingness to adjust contract amounts to fully reflect some of the exchange rate fluctuations 
brazilian counsel has advised the company that there is uncertainty as to the enforceability of provisions which tie payments to foreign currency rates 
the company  therefore  has reached a settlement with one customer and is currently in the process of negotiating a settlement of its receivables from another of its brazilian customers 
the company s currency exposure in brazil is also exacerbated by the brazilian exchange control rules  which limit the company s ability to repatriate its brazilian currency 
as of april   the company s cash assets included approximately million in brazil based on the exchange rates as of such date 
while the company is in the process of repatriating such funds  there can be no assurance that such process will be completed in a timely fashion or that the company will not suffer additional losses as a result of the brazilian currency fluctuation 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment rate and credit risks by monitoring credit quality standards and maturity dates of investments 
the company s exposure to market risk is not expected to be material 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio
