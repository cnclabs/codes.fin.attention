overview recognizing the consolidation trend in the commercial mid range systems distribution industry  we commenced our acquisition strategy in december with the acquisition of first computer corporation 
since then  we have focused upon expanding our commercial mid range server distribution business through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
since december  we have completed ten acquisitions  which have expanded our products and services  increased our geographic market coverage  strengthened our management and technical personnel and increased our operating leverage

income taxes due to the use of net operating loss carryforwards generated in and years prior  our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively  as compared to a normal combined effective tax rate of approximately for federal and state income taxes 
as of december   we had used substantially all of our available federal net operating loss carryforward amounts 
due to the use of these carryforwards and the significant amount of non tax deductible amortization expense related to goodwill incurred in certain acquisitions  our effective tax rate was in we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately the same percentage in results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain income and expense items as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense total operating expenses operating income interest expense income before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax expense income before extraordinary item extraordinary item  net of tax effect net income comparisons of years ended december   and net sales 
net sales consists of sales of commercial mid range servers  integrated personal computers  workstations  peripheral equipment  storage products  software and remarketed installation and technical support services  net of sales discounts and returns 
net sales increased by to million in from million in  and in from million in sales increased due to the continued expansion of our computer systems distribution business  particularly through the acquisition of sms in the third quarter of the acquisitions of mcba and real  the opening of a sales office in canada and increased software sales  primarily as a result of the acquisition of udc  also contributed to the rise in revenue 
mcba  real and udc accounted for approximately million of net sales in sales also increased due to the recruitment of new customers  hiring of additional sales representatives  increased integration orders and higher storage product sales as well as general market demand for computer systems 
for the years ended december  and  sales to sirius accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales 
our sales to sirius are made under the sirius agreement  pursuant to which we appointed sirius as one of our industry remarketer affiliates of ibm products 
the sirius agreement provides that sirius may not enter into any similar arrangement with any third party for the purpose of selling ibm products to its end user customers and also provides a favorable pricing structure to sirius 
as a result  sirius is expected to remain our largest customer for the duration of the sirius agreement and to account for approximately the same percentage of our net sales in as it represented in the sirius agreement expires on september   but may be terminated earlier under certain conditions  not including termination at will 
gross profit 
cost of sales is comprised of purchase costs  net of early payment and volume discounts and product freight and does not include any depreciation or amortization expense 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales is affected by several factors including the mix of high margin and low margin products and services and the proportion of large orders on which we extend volume discounts to our customers 
gross profit increased by to million in from million in  and by in from million 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in the decrease from to is a result of a higher proportion of large orders on which we extended volume discounts to our customers and the historically lower gross profit percentages of sms  mcba and real 
the increase from to was due to a greater mix of higher margin products and services  including integration and technical support services  as well as increased volume discounts provided by certain vendors 
operating expenses 
operating expenses include salaries and commissions paid to sales representatives  compensation paid to marketing  product management  technical and administrative personnel  depreciation of infrastructure costs  including our information system and leasehold improvements  amortization of intangibles resulting from goodwill recorded from acquisitions  facility lease expenses  telephone and data line expenses and provision for bad debt losses 
fluctuations in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales can result from planned expenditures by us for additional sales  marketing  technical support and administrative personnel  efficiencies gained through higher sales volumes and resulting economies of scale and the timing of acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million in from million in  and by in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to the acquisitions of sms  mcba  real and udc  necessary personnel increases as a result of higher systems sales and start up costs associated with opening an office in canada 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in due to the economies of scale generated from acquisitions and rapid net sales growth 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were essentially the same as in  despite net sales growth 
as a percentage of net sales  these costs increased as a result of investments made in infrastructure and personnel additions 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million in from million in  and by from million in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in in  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was similar to the percentage due to the additional amortization expense from the acquisitions of sms  mcba  udc and real 
in  this percentage increased from due to higher amortization expense as a result of increased goodwill related to larger acquisitions and higher depreciation costs incurred due to leasehold improvements and computer equipment additions 
operating income 
operating income increased by to million in from million in  and by from million in operating income as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in the increases in operating income resulted from higher net sales  operating expense control and economies of scale 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by to million in from million in  and by from million in interest expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in the increases in interest expense in and were due to additional borrowings necessary to fund acquisitions  infrastructure additions  expanded operations and overall growth 
in addition  interest expense in also increased due to the amortization of a discount on warrants issued in september the warrants were originally determined to have a fair market value of  which was recorded as discount on notes payable 
during the first quarter of  the warrants were revalued at  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the discount on the warrants in we will not incur an additional expense resulting from the warrants as the unamortized value was expensed as a result of our public offering and subsequent payoff of the debt underlying the warrants 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million   and  in  and  respectively  reflecting effective tax rates  and  respectively 
in  our effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate in due to non deductible goodwill  state income taxes and other intangibles 
the effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rates in and due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from losses generated in and prior and the release of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
these net operating loss carryforwards were fully applied in in connection with the repayment of our outstanding debt obligations  we recorded an extraordinary charge of  net of tax  resulting from a prepayment penalty  the write off of unamortized discounts relating to certain warrants issued to debt holders and other related expenses 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data and such data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the quarters of and in our opinion  this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  and all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

total operating expenses 
operating income interest expense income before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax expense income before extraordinary item extraordinary item  net of tax effect net income loss our quarterly net sales and operating results may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  changes in the supply and demand for commercial mid range servers  peripheral equipment  software and related services  the cost  timing and integration of acquisitions  the addition or loss of a key vendor or customer  the introduction of new technologies  changes in manufacturers prices  price protection policies or stock rotation privileges  changes in market development funds  changes in the level of operating expenses  product supply shortages  disruption of warehousing or shipping channels  inventory adjustments  increases in the amount of accounts receivable written off  price competition  changes in the mix of products sold through distribution channels and in the mix of products purchased by oems 
operating results could also be adversely affected by general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  a downturn in the market for commercial mid range servers  and order cancellations or rescheduling 
in addition  the computer distribution industry experiences both seasonal trends and  within each quarter  tends to sell a substantial amount of its products at the end of the quarter 
for example  our largest vendor  ibm  sells approximately of its products in the last calendar quarter 
historically  a substantial portion of our net sales has been made in the last few days of a quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict and delays in the completion of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly net sales to fall substantially short of anticipated levels and  to a greater degree  adversely affect profitability 
because of the many factors that can affect our operating results  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
our future operating results are expected to continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have required substantial capital to finance accounts receivable  inventories  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in the past  we have financed these requirements primarily through borrowings under credit facilities  cash generated from operations  the issuance and sale of common and series a preferred stock and subordinated notes 
in september  we agreed with ibmcc to increase the ibmcc credit facility line from million to million 
product purchases from ibm and cash advances from ibmcc are directly charged to the credit line and are paid by us based on payment terms outlined in the ibmcc credit facility 
borrowings under the ibmcc credit facility are based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined 
the ibmcc credit facility expires on august  and contains restrictive covenants which include the maintenance of minimum current  tangible net worth and times interest earned ratios  as defined 
as of december  and  we had outstanding obligations under the ibmcc credit facility of million and million  respectively 
of the total outstanding borrowings  million and million represented cash advances at december  and  respectively 
cash advances bear interest at the prime rate plus at december  
based on eligible assets  as of december   we had additional borrowings available under the ibmcc credit facility of approximately million 
on september   we executed an amendment to the ibmcc credit facility  under which we obtained an additional loan of  to consummate the real transaction 
the loan bears interest at prime plus at december  and is due in september  operating activities for provided cash in the amount of million 
for this period  cash was provided primarily as a result of increases in accounts payable of million and other current liabilities of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
favorable accounts payable terms with ibmcc and increased leasing of product purchases by customers through ibmcc and third party leasing vendors resulted in the generation of cash in for  net cash of million was provided 
this was primarily attributable to growth in sales and the resulting increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
investing activities for used cash in the amount of million 
for this period  cash was used for the purchase of real and udc and continuing leasehold and computer hardware and software investments made at the headquarters  sales office and warehouse and integration center sites 
for  million was used in investing activities  principally for the acquisitions of sms and tsi as well as infrastructure additions 
cash provided by financing activities for was million  consisting of a million loan from ibmcc and proceeds from a secondary offering of our common stock of million offset by payments on the subordinated notes  sms seller notes and the ibmcc credit advance totaling million 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  which resulted primarily from borrowings under the subordinated notes and the ibmcc credit advance totaling million and the issuance of series a preferred stock totaling million  partially offset by our reduction in short term borrowings by million 
we believe we have sufficient funds  or alternate sources of funds  to carry on our business as presently conducted through year compliance issues general we are in the process of conducting a year compliance audit and developing and implementing a company wide year compliance project the project 
the project addresses a broad range of issues affecting us as a result of the programming code in existing computer  and computer related  systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risks for us from problems in our own computer and embedded systems and from third parties with whom we deal on financial and other transactions 
failure of our and or third parties computer systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business 
the project is being headed up by our vice president of information technology  who reports directly to the chief financial officer 
internal systems our business software system includes an enterprise wide solution which was upgraded to the most recent version in fiscal this system handles our most critical functions  including  finance  inventory control  warehousing  shipping and receiving  logistics  purchasing  sales and order taking 
over the last three months  our business software system was upgraded to a more current version  which we believe to be year compliant 
certain of our offices are not yet fully integrated into our enterprise wide business software system 
it is expected that our newly acquired offices in huntsville  alabama and canada will be integrated over the next three months 
once all of our offices are integrated into our business software system  we will still need to upgrade the associated database and hardware systems on which the software system runs 
the hardware upgrade is expected to be completed by april and to cost approximately  we completed the upgrade of our database by migrating to the next version of the software in march since our most critical functions are run on the enterprise wide business software system  any year problems at the hardware or software level could have a material adverse effect on us 
if the system failed to work on january  it could prevent us from controlling our inventory  taking orders  buying inventory and billing our customers 
we are inventorying and analyzing our remaining centralized computer and embedded systems  as well as our wan data services  wan hardware  networking equipment  voice mail equipment and access and alarm systems  to identify any potential year issues and we will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis 
we currently expect to substantially complete remediation and validation of our internal systems  as well as to develop contingency plans  by mid third party suppliers and vendors we are currently in the process of developing a plan for contacting our critical suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors to determine if their operations and the projects and services that they provide to us are year compliant 
our largest supplier of product is ibm  with approximately of our revenue derived from sales of ibm products 
as a result  we will devote substantial effort in dealing with ibm in addressing any potential year problems supplied by ibm 
absent written assurances of year compliance by such third parties  we will assume that such third parties will not be year compliant and we will attempt to reduce our risks with respect to the failure of such third parties to be year compliant by developing contingency plans 
however  there can be no assurance that in all instances contingency plans can be adopted or that they will adequately serve the needs of our customers and other constituents 
products because we are a distributor of mid range computers  software and peripheral products  the year issue is likely to have a substantial affect on the products that we sell 
we will deal directly with the manufacturers of our products to determine whether such products are year compliant 
as a distributor  we will not make representations and warranties to our customers regarding year compliance of the products we sell 
rather  we assign to our customers the manufacturer s warranties 
however  if there are year compliance issues it could increase our risk of product returns  increased inventory and or reduced sales 
while we believe that our largest line of products  ibm as and rs mid range servers  are year compliant  there can be no assurance that the other products we distribute do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year that may result in material costs to us 
should the ibm as or rs mid range servers fail to be year compliant or should ibm be unable to supply product because of year issues  the effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition would be severe 
year costs the total cost associated with the year audit and required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to our financial position based on preliminary assessments resulting from the early phases of the project 
the estimated total cost of the project is approximately   of which has already been spent to upgrade some non year compliant software and systems 
it is possible that as we continue our audit and detect problems that are not currently known to us  additional costs may be incurred  which could be substantial 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  our normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of the year failures will have a material impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
backlog although we receive purchase orders for products to be delivered to customers over a specified time period  there can be no assurance that such orders will result in sales  as most orders are subject to revision or cancellation without penalty 
consequently  we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales for future periods 
recent pronouncements in march  the accounting standards executive committee  or acsec  released statement of position  or sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires companies to capitalize certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  provided that those costs are not research and development 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the requirements of sop and the effects  if any  on our current policies on accounting for software costs
