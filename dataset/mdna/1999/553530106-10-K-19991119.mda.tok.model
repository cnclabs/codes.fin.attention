item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in recent years  we made the strategic decision to leverage msc s strength as a low cost  value added mro provider by adding new products and categories of mro supplies  such as welding and electrical supplies  which has increased  and is anticipated to further increase  sales to existing customers and access to new customers 
we believe that revenue has increased  in part  as a result of the increase in the number of skus  however  we are unable to quantify precisely the impact of such increase 
we generally add skus in response to the feedback we receive from our existing customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the number of skus offered or that the correlation between the number of skus offered and revenue will continue 
we significantly expanded our direct mail marketing program from approximately million pieces in fiscal to million pieces in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we refocused our marketing program in an effort to enhance our investments in recently acquired entities and new distribution centers 
accordingly  in fiscal  mailings increased to million pieces 
targeted mailings to customers or potential customers are designed to maximize our return in relation to our marketing expenditures 
we utilize our customer databases to match specific customer profiles with an expanding selection of catalog titles which emphasize specific product categories 
we believe that increasing mailings to more targeted customer segments has resulted in increased marketing productivity 
in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities by further increasing our direct marketing efforts  however  the costs associated with our direct marketing program will be incurred substantially in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
such costs are expected to be offset  in part  by increases in vendor funded co op payments which will offset a portion of the catalog and mailing expenses 
there can be no assurance that continued expansion of our direct mail marketing program will result in new customers or an increase in sales from existing customers 
revenue per employee increased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  during fiscal we believe that this increase in revenue per employee is indicative of our efforts to achieve higher levels of efficiency and cost savings at the employee level 
the number of annual orders entered and processed has increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million during fiscal the average order size for our core business has increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately during fiscal we believe that our targeted marketing campaign strategy  our strategy of continuing to add new product categories and new products within existing categories  and increased efficiencies in order processing have been significant contributing factors to the increase in orders we have received and sales  both from existing customers and from new customers 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to continue to grow at rates recently experienced or at all 
results of operations the following table summarizes msc s historical results of operations as a percentage of sales for the three most recent fiscal years 
august  august  august  net sales dollars in thousands    net sales gross profit operating expenses income from operations net income fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to the company s existing customers  an increase in the number of active customers and the effect of acquisitions made during fiscal and fiscal the increase in sales to existing customers was principally derived from an increase of in the number of skus offered  as well as from more focused marketing efforts 
average annual sales per customer increased  and the number of active customers increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal sales from the companies acquired in accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily attributable to increased sales 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased from to 
the decrease resulted primarily from the mix of products being sold and as a result of lower margins realized from customers and product lines gained through the company s acquisitions 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased slightly from to 
the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to leveraging fixed costs over a larger revenue base  offset in part by expenses required to prepare the company s new distribution center for operations  additional costs of the new headquarters and expenditures for future growth initiatives 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales and the dollar amount increase in gross profit offset in part by an increase in operating expenses 
net income increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of previously mentioned increases in sales and gross profit  offset in part by the increase in operating expenses necessary in order to support the increase in volume and to invest in future growth

diluted 







we have generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of commencement of operations at new distribution centers 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  acquisitions and facilities expansions 
our primary sources of financing have been cash from operations  supplemented by bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and a portion of the proceeds from our public offering completed at the end of fiscal we anticipate that the proceeds from these offerings  our cash flows from operations and available lines of credit will be adequate to support our operations for the immediate future and for at least the next months 
under the terms of the credit facility  we have available unsecured borrowings of up to million 
interest on amounts borrowed may be paid at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate at august  or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from to per annum 
our credit facility contains certain covenants limiting mergers  use of proceeds  indebtedness  liens  investments  sale of assets and acquisitions 
our credit facility also contains certain financial covenants which require msc to maintain a minimum net worth  ratio of current assets to current liabilities  ratio of liabilities to effective net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio and positive net income  to refrain from capital expenditures in excess of certain amounts and to limit the issuance of dividends 
as of august   the company was not in compliance with certain financial covenants  but has received a waiver from the respective banks 
as of august   the company had approximately million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million and net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
the decrease in net cash provided by operations resulted from increases in inventory commensurate with the company s sales growth  the introduction of new products and inventory for the company s new distribution center  offset in part by an increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the net usage of cash in fiscal was primarily attributable to cash paid for construction at the company s new headquarters  expenditures related to the construction of a new distribution center and cash paid for acquisitions 
the net usage of cash in fiscal was primarily attributable to cash paid for acquisitions and to the purchase of a building in long island  new york  which began serving as the new corporate headquarters in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the increase of approximately million is primarily attributable to proceeds received from notes payable  offset in part by the purchase in the open market of approximately  shares of class a common stock 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares of msc s class a common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
all shares of class a common stock acquired are being retained in msc s treasury and reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options granted under msc s stock option plan and stock option plan 
year compliance plan year problem 
the year problem arises from the historic use of only two digits rather than four for the designation of a year in date information within computer programs 
if not corrected  any of our equipment or software programs that perform time sensitive calculations may incorrectly identify the year as instead of  or not recognize it at all 
this could result in miscalculations or a major failure of certain systems 
we may also be vulnerable to the year problems of our customers  suppliers and service vendors and of other companies with which we conduct business eg  utility companies  shippers and telecommunications companies 
state of readiness 
during calendar years and  we developed and began to implement a year compliance plan using internal and external resources in an effort to ensure that our business is not interrupted by the year problem 
msc s year compliance plan is broken into four components renovating internal systems and applications 
our internal systems and applications include order entry  purchasing and warehouse management 
the applications used in the order entry system have been re written and were phased into msc s call center and branch locations 
this process was completed by may the applications for the purchasing and warehouse management systems have been modified and our year compliance work was completed in august many of our applications are already year compliant as they were written using a compliant code generator 
ensuring compliance of peripheral third party systems 
we use a number of third party package systems to supplement our internally developed programs 
major systems in this area are our financial and inventory replenishment systems 
our financial systems have been replaced with a new package and are running on this software 
the inventory replenishment system has been tested and appears to be year compliant 
all of our material hardware  including our as computers  telephone systems  networks  pcs  security systems and time clocks at all msc locations have been tested as year compliant 
ensuring year compliance by external companies that conduct business with msc 
we have contacted all of our major customers  suppliers and vendors to inquire about year compliance 
we have not received responses from all those contacted  but those who have responded do not indicate any problems at this time 
in addition  we have conducted tests to determine whether those business partners with which we currently conduct business electronically are year compliant 
our tests reveal no problems at this time 
implementing standards and conducting testing in an effort to ensure that msc s existing and future systems are year compliant 
all new systems  whether hardware or software  are tested before implementation in an effort to ensure year compliance 
cost of compliance 
we believe that the total cost of our year compliance plan will be million not including the replacement of the financial system 
these costs are expensed as incurred and  to date  we have incurred approximately million of such expenses 
the financial systems replacement is a separate project which is estimated to cost approximately million and will be capitalized 
risks 
although we believe we will have our own systems compliant prior to january   there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so nor can there be any assurance that  even if we complete timely our year compliance plan  the systems  when actually implemented in full  will work properly independently or in conjunction with the systems of any business partner 
in addition  we would continue to bear the risk of a material adverse affect if any of our business partners does not appropriately address its own year compliance issues 
although we believe that our major customers are year compliant  we are still in the process of reviewing the compliance programs of suppliers and service vendors 
our current estimates of the impact of the year problem on our operations and financial results do not include costs and time that may be incurred as a result of other companies failure to become year compliant on a timely basis  which costs could be material 
there can be no assurance that such other companies will achieve year compliance or that any conversions by such companies to become year compliant will be compatible with our computer systems 
the inability of msc or any of our principal suppliers  service vendors or customers to become year compliant in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
contingency plans 
we have arranged for alternative methods of placing purchase orders and for the stockpiling of certain inventory items in the event that our suppliers are not year compliant 
we do not have any other contingency plans with respect to other problems that could arise in our business as a result of the year problem 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term notes payable under an unsecured revolving credit agreement 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit agreement 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in the company s net income and cash flows 
the company has an million revolving credit line of which approximately million was outstanding at august  the agreement bears interest at the bank s base rate at august   or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from to per annum based on the ratio of total liabilities to effective net worth  or bid note rate 
if the principal amounts under the company s credit agreement remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  then the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional million in interest that year 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
