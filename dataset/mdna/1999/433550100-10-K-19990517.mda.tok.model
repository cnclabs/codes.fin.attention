the company s focus during the past several years has been on growth and expansion 
the acquisitions of smx and sedeco increased the area in which the company is the exclusive distributor of tajima embroidery equipment from states to states 
in january  tajima granted the company the exclusive right to distribute small one through six head fx models tajima embroidery machines in nine western states and hawaii 
with this expansion of the company s small machine territory to the west coast  hirsch now has the right to distribute tajima machines throughout the continental united states and hawaii 
in fiscal hirsch formed tui for the purpose of assembling tajima embroidery machines in the united states 
production at tui consists of models in configurations of up to six heads per machine 
in january tokai industries tajima s manufacturing arm purchased a percent interest in tui 
this investment reflects their continuing confidence in this endeavor and will be a contributing factor in the long range growth of tui 
the company grew rapidly from the time of its initial public offering through fiscal growth was fueled by rapid technological advances in software and hardware  the continued strong demand for embroidered products  the creation of new embroidery applications and the continued strength of the embroidery entrepreneur as a growing segment of the marketplace 
the company believes that the purchasers of smaller embroidery machines are a significant source of repeat business for the sale of multi head embroidery machines as the entrepreneurs operations expand 
fiscal was a year of retrenchment for the industry  driven by a shift in the sales mix of embroidery machines and relocation offshore of large multi head equipment customers 
it was further compounded by dramatic swings in the us dollar yen exchange rate 
all industry competitors faced difficulty in meeting these new market demands 
the company initiated a restructuring program to address the market shifts in the industry  including closing and consolidating certain divisions  reducing total employment  and disposing of facilities no longer required to support its new business model see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the implementation of the restructuring program will position it to return to profitable operations at revenue levels reflecting today s market realities

for fiscal year  cost of sales decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal year the decrease was a result of the related decrease in net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset by the inventory write down of  recorded in fiscal the inventory write down relates to the company s restructuring plan and includes the write down of used machine and esw inventories see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fluctuation of the dollar against the yen has historically had a minimal effect on tajima equipment gross margins since currency fluctuations are generally reflected in pricing adjustments in order to maintain consistent gross margins on machine revenues

there was no effect on deferred taxes as a result of the smx acquisition  which was accounted for as an asset purchase for tax purposes 
the goodwill related to the smx acquisition is being amortized over years for both book and tax purposes

net income 
net income for fiscal year decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal year the net margin decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year these decreases are attributable to the increase in sg a expenses

year compliance the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems may not be able to recognize the year or may do so incorrectly as the year this inability to recognize or properly interpret the year may result in the incorrect processing of financial and operational information 
the company has established a steering committee to address year issues  including senior members of the management team  which will report regularly to the board of directors 
the committee has initiated a program to upgrade its internal information systems to address any year compliance issues 
this program includes a focus on internal policies  methods and tools  as well as inquiries of and coordination with customers and suppliers 
the company expects its year program to be completed on a timely basis  and is currently implementing new computer systems that will substantially insure that the company s operating systems are not subject to year transition problems 
to the extent current systems that will not be replaced have been determined to be non compliant  the company is working with the suppliers of such systems to obtain upgrades and or enhancements to insure year compliance 
the company has made a thorough review of its proprietary software products and believes that its current products are year compliant 
many of the company s customers may be  however  using earlier versions of the company s software products  which may not be year compliant 
the company has initiated programs to proactively notify such customers of the risks associated with using these products and to actively encourage such customers to migrate to the company s current software products 
based upon the company s current estimates  incremental out of pocket costs of its year program will aggregate approximately  these costs are expected to be incurred primarily in fiscal year and consist mainly of remediation of and or upgrades to existing computer hardware and software and telecommunication systems 
such costs do not include internal management time and the deferral of other projects  the effects of which are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s total year project costs include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
the company has initiated a vendor compliance program and has inquired with its key vendors as to the status of such vendors year compliance 
based on the responses to date  the company believes that its key vendors either currently are year compliant  or will complete their year programs on a timely basis 
however  there can be no guarantee that such vendors upon which the company relies will be able to timely address their year compliance issues 
a reasonable worst case year scenario would be the failure of key vendors and or suppliers to have corrected their own year issues which could cause disruption of the company s operations  the effects of which may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the impact of such disruption cannot be estimated at this time 
in the event the company believes that any of its key suppliers are unlikely to be able to resolve their year issues  it will obtain an alternative source of supply 
backlog and inventory the ability of the company to fill orders quickly is an important part of its customer service strategy 
the embroidery machines held in inventory by the company are generally shipped within a week from the date the customer s orders are received  and as a result  backlog is not meaningful as an indicator of future sales 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had  or will have in the foreseeable future  a material impact upon the company s operating results 
recent pronouncements of the financial accounting standards board in fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers disclosure about pensions and other post retirement benefits an amendment to fasb statement no 
 and sfas 
each of these statements required additional disclosure in the company s consolidated financial statements but did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recent pronouncements of the financial accounting standards board fasb which are not required to be adopted at this date include  statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  based upon current data the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
market risk sensitivity the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during fiscal  the principal transactions hedged were purchases of machinery from the company s major supplier 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
the cost of such contracts is included in the cost of the related machinery in inventory 
a strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against purchases denominated in foreign currencies could have had approximately a  million impact on the net pre tax operations of the company 
the company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge expected earnings 
all of the company debt is us dollar denominated 
at year end  approximately of this indebtedness to third parties was floating rate based 
although the company has exposure to rising and falling rates  a rise in rates on the average outstanding floating rate based borrowings during the fiscal year would have had approximately a  adverse impact on net pre tax operations 
the company does not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
