item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company changed its fiscal year end from the last day of february to december  effective as of december  the change resulted in a short period of ten months that began march   and ended december  the growth in the company s operating revenues and net earnings during was the result of an increase in the number of acute  subacute and outpatient programs  and growth from acquisitions 
the results reflect an increase in the average number of inpatient units from to  an increase in the average number of outpatient units managed by the company from to  an increase in contract therapy locations from to  and increased nursing weeks worked due to the acquisition of starmed 
the growth for was primarily attributable to an increase in acute and subacute units plus increased therapy weeks worked at hssi 
the growth for reflects the increase in the number of subacute units and results from the acquisition of hssi 
in the normal course of business  new units are opened and some existing units are closed each year 
during the first year of operation  a new acute rehabilitation unit will typically be subject to limitations in reimbursement from medicare considerably below the hospital s operating cost 
as a consequence  during this period the company agrees with the client hospital to bear certain costs on the hospital s behalf and to waive a portion of its fees until the unit qualifies for an exemption from medicare limitations 
the company assists the hospital in qualifying the unit for the exemption and in minimizing the unreimbursed costs during this non exempt period 
the company s average operating losses during the qualifying period can range to as high as  to  per unit 
if the company does not obtain an exemption for the unit  the contract may be terminated and  in the event of termination  losses would generally not be recoverable 
upon completion of the qualifying year and obtaining the exemption  the hospital is eligible to recover all of its costs related to the operation of the unit  including the company s fees under the management contract 
once a unit becomes exempt  the unit experiences accelerated growth in operating revenues and profitability as the patient population is expanded in response to the more favorable reimbursement terms 
subacute units and outpatient programs are not subject to the same limitations in reimbursement from medicare as acute rehabilitation units and  therefore  should result in significantly reduced start up losses per unit 
in  congress enacted changes to the medicare regulations calling for the implementation of snu pps that is being phased in commencing in july as of january   substantially all of the company s managed skilled nursing units were wholly under snu pps

in   of contingent consideration was paid to the former owners of team and moore 
on january   the company made a tender offer to purchase up to  shares of its common stock at a single purchase price  not less than nor in excess of per share 
the actual purchase price was determined based on the lowest single purchase price at which stockholders tendered shares that was sufficient to purchase  shares 
as of february   the closing date  shares totaling greater than  were tendered  resulting in the company s repurchase on march   of a total of  shares at the single per share price of per share

the increase in billable census per unit for inpatient units is primarily attributable to a increase in admissions per unit  offset by a decline in average billable length of stay 
the decline in average length of stay reflects both the continued trend of reduced rehabilitation lengths of stay and the increase in subacute units operational in  which carry a shorter length of stay than acute rehabilitation units

twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  management believes that a comparison of the twelve months ended december  to the ten months ended december  is not meaningful because of the difference in length of reporting periods 
therefore  this discussion and analysis of results of operations includes a comparison of the audited twelve month period ended december   to the unaudited twelve month period ended december  operating revenues in increased by  or  to  as compared to the same period in acquisitions accounted for of the net increase 
a increase in the average number of inpatient units from to units  and an increase in the average daily billable census per inpatient unit of from to  generated a increase in billable patient days to  the increase in billable census per unit for inpatient units is primarily attributable to a increase in admissions per unit  offset by a decline in average billable length of stay 
the decline in average length of stay reflects both the continued trend of reduced rehabilitation lengths of stay and the increase in subacute units operational in  which carry a shorter length of stay than acute rehabilitation units 
the increase in billable patient days was offset by a decrease in average per diem billing rates  reflecting a greater mix of subacute units which carry lower average per diem rates than acute units 
the  increase in inpatient unit revenue was offset by a decrease in outpatient revenue to  primarily reflecting the loss of two units

liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had  in cash and current marketable securities and a current ratio of working capital as of december   increased from december   by  reflecting working capital from the acquisitions of starmed and therapeutic systems and working capital generated by operations 
net accounts receivable were  at december  compared to  at december  the number of days average net revenues in net receivable was days and days as of december  and december   respectively 
the increase is primarily the result of acquisitions of businesses that traditionally carry longer payment terms from clients 
during the year ended december   the company incurred capital expenditures of  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  at december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
in connection with the development and implementation of additional units  the company may incur capital expenditures for equipment and deferred costs arising from payments made to hospitals for a portion of capital improvements needed to begin a unit s operation 
for the twelve months ended december   the company made deferred cost payments to four client hospitals totaling  for capital improvements  while for the twelve months ended december   payments were made to four client hospitals totaling  at december   the company had commitments totaling  to make additional capital improvement payments to client hospitals 
the company s operating cash flows constitute its primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund its working capital requirements 
the company expects to meet its future working capital  capital expenditure  business expansion and debt service requirements from a combination of internal sources and outside financing 
as part of the acquisitions of rcsa  starmed and therapeutic systems  the company s bank term loan and revolving credit facility were restructured 
under the terms of the restructured loan agreement  the company entered into a five year bank term loan with a commitment of up to  the amount that may be borrowed under the revolving credit facility was increased to the lesser of  or of eligible accounts receivable  reduced by amounts outstanding under the company s bank letter of credit

year the company is subject to risks associated with year compliance  a term which refers to the ability of various data processing hardware and software systems to interpret dates correctly after the beginning of january  the company has developed and presented to the board of directors its action plan for year compliance 
the major phases of the action plan are awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the awareness phase included a communication of year compliance issues and the potential ramifications to the company  education and identification of key systems 
the assessment phase included the inventorying of systems that may be impacted by year issues 
most of the company s systems are purchased from industry known vendors and are generally used in their standard configuration 
other systems will be replaced by or converted to year compatible systems 
the company has closely reviewed the year progress as reported by each vendor 
the company has been assured by certain of these vendors  that new year compliant systems have been installed 
in all other cases  compliant systems will be delivered in time for installation and testing prior to year end the final phase of the action plan is the implementation of remediated and other systems into the operating environment of the company 
for those systems that have not yet been delivered  the company expects delivery of compliant systems not later than early in the second quarter of the final phase of the plan is scheduled to be completed by june  concurrent with the development and execution of the plan is the evolution of a contingency plan that includes procedures to be followed should a system fail 
the company is also completing an assessment of year risks relating to its lines of business separate from its dependence on data processing 
the assessment includes corresponding with customers to ascertain their overall preparedness regarding year risks 
the plan also provides for the identification and communication with significant non data processing third party vendors regarding their preparedness for year risks 
it is not possible to quantify the overall potential adverse effects to the company resulting from these customers or non data vendors failure to adequately prepare for year compliance 
the failure of a customer to prepare adequately for year could have a significant adverse effect on such customer s operations and profitability  which  in turn  could inhibit its ability to pay for the company s services in accordance with their terms 
failure of a non data vendor to prepare adequately for year could have a significant adverse effect on the vendor s operations  which  in turn  could inhibit the vendor s ability to deliver purchased goods and services to the company in a timely manner 
the company also recognizes the importance of year compliance by customers  payment sources  and vendors to the company s customers and vendors 
the company must necessarily rely upon the compliance programs of these third parties 
the company does not expect that the cost of the year compliance will be material to its business  financial condition  or results of operations  nor does management anticipate any material disruption in operations as the result of any failure by the company or its subsidiaries 
while the company is making a substantial effort to become year compliant  there is no assurance the failure to adequately address all issues relating to the year issue would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continues to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
the company s management contracts typically provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to the company by its client hospitals based upon increases in various inflation indices 
these increases generally offset increases in costs incurred by the company
