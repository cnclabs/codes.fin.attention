fonar s principal mri products are its quad and quad mri scanners 
having received the necessary fda approvals for its quad scanners  the company believes it is in a position to aggressively seek new sales 
the quad scanners are highly competitive and totally new non claustrophobic scanners not previously available in the mri market

the company believes its present financial resources are sufficient to achieve the sales  service and production levels necessary to support its operations 
the company has developed and begun to implement a new program to finance a portion of the purchase price of its scanners through a newly formed subsidiary  fonar acceptance corporation  and to assist the customer in obtaining the remaining portion of its financing through an independent source or sources

cost containment programs continue in force notwithstanding an increase in costs and expenses resulting from increased manufacturing activity and marketing of its mri scanners and the expansion of hmca s physician and diagnostic management services business 
these programs  which include increasing the portion of manufacturing conducted on the company s premises  have enabled the company to achieve significantly lower manufacturing costs than would have otherwise been experienced in the production of its quad scanners 
this has enabled the company to pass on to customers a much needed reduction in the sales price of mri scanners

fees for on going service and maintenance from the company s installed base of scanners were million for the year ended june  and million for the year ended june  transactions between the company and its subsidiaries are eliminated in the consolidation 
the company will continue to aggressively develop and market upgrades and enhancements for previously installed scanners
