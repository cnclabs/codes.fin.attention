results of segment operations the corporation s operations are managed along two major operating segments banking and the financial management group 
a description of each business and the methodologies used to measure financial performance are described in note v to the consolidated financial statements on page the following table summarizes operating earnings and net income by operating segment for each of the last three years year ended december dollars in thousands banking    financial management group    non banks    consolidated operating earnings    consolidated net income    excludes the after tax impact of the million overton merger related charge 
see discussion on page the increase in banking net income in both and was due primarily to loan growth and higher service charge income coupled with the impact of the acquisitions of corpus christi bancshares  inc and harrisburg bancshares  inc 
the increase in the financial management group net income in both years was due mainly to the appreciation in market value of trust assets  new accounts and the acquisition of corpus christi bancshares  inc the increase in the operating loss in non banks during reflects partially increased funding costs due to the issuance of the trust preferred capital securities 
net interest income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for was million  an increase from million recorded in and the million recorded in the primary reason for the yearly increase has been the consistent growth in loans generated both internally and through acquisitions 
see consolidated average balance sheets on pages and and rate volume analysis on page the net interest margin  was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent and percent for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin from a year ago is due to higher loan volumes and lower deposit costs 
the slight decrease in the net interest margin in from is reflective of higher deposit costs and interest expense related to the million trust preferred capital securities issued in early  see note i borrowed funds on page net interest spread for increased five basis points to percent 
the increase in net interest spread for is primarily due to the corporation s ability to maintain its earnings on funds with higher loan volumes and the favorable impact of the acquisitions  while deposit costs decreased 
net interest spread was percent and percent for and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest spread for is largely the result of the issuance of the million trust preferred capital securities 
the net interest spread as well as the net interest margin could be impacted by future changes in short and long term interest rate levels 
market risk disclosure interest rate sensitivity market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument due to the changes in market rates and prices 
in the ordinary course of business  the corporation s market risk is primarily that of interest rate risk 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored by its asset liability management committee on an ongoing basis 
the committee seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to maintain consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  level of risk over time and exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
the corporation utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest income and net income over the ensuing month period 
the model was used to measure the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing ratably basis points over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
all off balance sheet financial instruments such as derivatives are included in the model 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
the resulting model simulations show that a basis point increase in rates will result in a positive variance in net interest income of percent relative to the base case over the next months  while a decrease of basis points will result in a negative variance in net interest income of percent 
this compares to last year when a basis points increase in rates resulted in a positive variance in net interest income of percent relative to the base case over the next months while a decrease of basis points resulted in a negative variance in net interest income of percent 
the corporation s trading portfolio is immaterial and as such separate quantitative disclosure is not presented 
as the table below indicates  the corporation is liability sensitive  on a cumulative basis  at time periods of one year or less assuming non maturity deposits are immediately rate sensitive 
this gap analysis is based on a point in time and may not be meaningful because assets and liabilities must be categorized according to contractual maturities and repricing periods rather than estimating more realistic behaviors as is done in the sensitivity model discussed above 
also  the gap analysis does not consider subsequent changes in interest rate levels or spreads between asset and liability categories 
the corporation continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the corporation s objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  the corporation may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities or enter into derivative contracts to mitigate potential market risk

in developing the classifications used for this analysis  it was necessary to make certain assumptions and approximations in assigning assets and liabilities to different maturity categories 
for example  savings and interest on checking are subject to immediate withdrawal and as such are presented as repricing within the earliest period presented even though their balances have historically not shown significant sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
loans are included net of unearned discount of  consumer loans are distributed in the immediately rate sensitive category for those tied to market rates or to other categories according to the repayment schedule 
the above table does not reflect interest rate swaps further discussed on page liquidity asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  short term time deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core depositors and correspondent banks in the corporation s natural trade area which maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to subsidiary banks of the corporation  as well as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements from upstream banks 
the liquidity position of the corporation is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate 
non interest income non interest income of million was reported for  compared with million for and million for excluding securities transactions  total non interest income increased percent from the non interest income growth in and was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of harrisburg bancshares  inc and corpus christi bancshares  inc 
in the first quarter of and  respectively

the volatility of general market conditions experienced throughout did have some impact on the overall level of growth in trust fees  however  some of the growth experienced in other service charges and other non interest income is attributable to fees collected through financial management services  such as mutual fund fees  brokerage commissions and annuity income 
the market value of trust assets increased to billion from billion last year 
the december  trust assets were comprised of discretionary assets of billion and non discretionary assets of billion compared to billion and billion last year  respectively 
the million or percent increase in trust income from to is attributable to the increase in the number of accounts held and trust asset growth resulting from improvement in the stock and bond market 
deposit service charges increased million or percent from the increase occurred as the result of some fee increases and broad based deposit growth that generated increases in overdraft charges  cash management fees on commercial and individual deposits  as well as increases in atm income 
deposit service charges increased million or percent from the increase was due mainly to higher service charges related to commercial deposits  volumes processed for correspondent banks and overdraft charges 
other service charges and fees increased million or percent when compared to this increase was primarily due to higher fees in accounts receivable factoring and mutual fund fees collected through financial management services 
the million or percent increase in other service charges from to was primarily due to the same factors mentioned above for the growth in offset by lower bankcard discounts resulting from the corporation s outsourcing of its bankcard processing operation which was completed in may during and  the corporation sold portions of its available for sale investment portfolio resulting in net gains of  and  respectively 
this compares to an  loss in which resulted primarily from the corporation restructuring a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio by replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities 
other non interest income increased million or percent to million in compared to an percent increase in the increase in is primarily due to growth in visa check card income  gains on the sale of student and mortgage loans and gains on the disposition of foreclosed assets 
the increase in from was primarily due to gains recorded on the sale of student loans  mineral interest income and visa check card income 
these increases were offset by higher gains on the disposition of certain loans and foreclosed assets recorded by the corporation in non interest expense excluding the merger related charge of million during the second quarter of which was associated with the merger of overton  non interest expense was million for compared with million for and million for the acquisitions of harrisburg bancshares  inc and corpus christi bancshares  inc in the first quarter of and  respectively  impacted the growth in non interest expense

salaries and wages in both years have experienced increases related to acquisitions and merit increases 
pension and other employee benefits increased by million or percent during as a result of retirement plan expense and the impact of the acquisition on payroll taxes and medical insurance 
the million or percent increase in pension and other employee benefits from to was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition on payroll taxes and medical insurance expense offset by lower contributions to fund the employer match on the employee related stock plans due to the use of forfeited shares 
net occupancy of banking premises increased million or percent during primarily attributable to higher property taxes  depreciation and lease expense as influenced by the acquisition and de novo branches opened late in and the percent increase in compared to was higher building maintenance costs  property taxes and operating expenses  partially offset by higher tenant income 
furniture and equipment costs increased million or percent in primarily due to the continued expansion of the corporation  as well as  technology initiatives and upgrades 
intangible amortization increased by million or percent and by  or percent in and  respectively  due to the acquisitions 
also included in was a million merger related charge associated with the merger of overton 
of the million charge  the majority was related to severance payments and other employee benefits  and investment banking fees 
other non interest expense increased million or percent during as a result of outside computer services related to the year compliance program  see year on page  as well as  an increase in the volume of visa check cards issued after its initial introduction in late other non interest expense was up percent in mostly due to expenses related to the year compliance program and higher operating expenses  such as  sales promotion  guard services  supplies  travel and telephone  which also were impacted by the acquisitions 
year the corporation has an extensive program in place to address the internal and external risks associated with the century date change to the year currently  the corporation estimates that the dollar amount to be spent on incremental costs will be approximately million over the three year period beginning in  funded out of its earnings  with approximately million spent through these costs are being expensed as incurred 
additionally  the corporation is spending about percent of its annual technology budget to facilitate progress on the year program 
the cost of compliance and completion dates is based upon management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of resources 
the corporation has systematically inventoried and assessed the importance of application software and system hardware and software during the now completed awareness and assessment phase of its information technology 
the corporation has also completed the renovation of mission critical systems and has implemented percent of the renovated mission critical systems 
the corporation has completed the renovation  testing and installation of percent of technology systems in its owned facilities  including vault doors  elevators  climate control systems  and security systems 
in addition  the corporation has completed percent of the testing of mission critical systems 
the corporation expects to be completed with the non mission critical applications by the second quarter of the corporation has commenced  and will continue into  integration testing to assure that logically related systems can interact and process information correctly 
during  the corporation reviewed the year preparedness of its vendors and suppliers  and recently completed on site due diligence visits with key service providers 
the great majority of these suppliers appear to be making adequate progress 
the corporation will continue to monitor vendor and supplier progress and develop contingency plans where necessary and feasible 
the corporation is testing for key dates in the new century with critical third party service providers  although it may be necessary to rely on proxy testing in some cases 
the majority of this work is expected to be done in the first half of the corporation will make available testing documentation  known as proxy tests  to clients utilizing certain products and services 
the corporation also relies on entities such as the federal reserve system  depository trust company  participants trust company  society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications swift  and the clearing house interbank payment systems chips in its securities processing and banking businesses  as do other financial services providers in similar businesses 
testing of data exchanges with organizations such as these is underway and is expected to be completed during by the second quarter of although the corporation is attempting to monitor and validate the efforts of other parties  it cannot control the success of these efforts 
the corporation is developing contingency plans where practical to provide alternatives in situations where a third party furnishing a critical product or service experiences significant year issues 
the corporation is also updating existing business continuity plans for the date change 
this process is well underway and will continue through the third quarter   as plans are reviewed and validated 
as part of its credit analysis process  the corporation has developed a project plan for assessing the year readiness of its significant credit customers 
an initial assessment of year readiness has been completed for the customers who have responded to the corporation s inquiries about their progress  which make up the majority of its credit customers and represent most of its credit exposure 
the corporation will continue to monitor the progress of these customers 
the financial management group s fmg mission critical systems  such as the trust and brokerage accounting and trading systems  are and have been included in the corporation s evaluation and testing of systems 
fmg is also updating current contingency plans to include possible year circumstances 
in addition to the systems aspect  the fmg recognizes that there could be other types of risks and is in the process of reviewing the managed assets comprising the investment portfolios of fmg clients 
the review process includes obtaining public information provided by companies issuers to regulatory bodies  such as the securities and exchange commission 
other public information that may be relied upon for evaluating a company s issuer s year readiness are analysts reports and or official statements from companies issuers 
although the fmg is attempting to review and monitor the efforts of other parties  it cannot warrant the facts  circumstances  or the outcome of such efforts 
where the corporation does not serve in a fiduciary capacity for a customer s assets it cannot provide any assurances on factors outside its control such as the quality of assets  potential economic uncertainties and other service providers 
the corporation also does not accept responsibility for ensuring that its clients own systems are year compliant 
in addition  the corporation does not guarantee that there will not be any disruptions on receipt or disbursements of income 
there may be disruptions that are beyond the control of the corporation 
an example of this would be if an issuer company or its paying agent does not pay income as scheduled 
the corporation s program is regularly reviewed by examiners from various external agencies such as the comptroller of the currency and the federal reserve bank 
the corporation expects to successfully complete its year effort as planned 
however  it is subject to unique risks and uncertainties due to the interdependencies in business and financial markets  and the numerous activities and events outside of its control 
since the corporation is still conducting external testing and monitoring of third parties  it is unable to make definitive assumptions as to the extent of year failures that could result  nor quantify the potential adverse effect that such failures could have on the corporation s operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
year risks will be continually evaluated and contingency plans revised throughout income taxes the corporation recognized income tax expense of million in  compared to million in  and million in the effective tax rate in was percent compared to percent in and percent in for a detailed analysis of the corporation s income taxes see note o income taxes on page cash earnings historically  excluding the merger with overton  the corporation s acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting which results in the creation of intangible assets 
these intangible assets are deducted from capital in the determination of regulatory capital 
thus  cash or tangible earnings represents the regulatory capital generated during the year and can be viewed as net income excluding intangible amortization  net of tax 
while the definition of cash or tangible earnings may vary by company  we believe this definition is appropriate as it measures the per share growth of regulatory capital  which impacts the amount available for dividends and acquisitions

most of the increase in period end loans is attributable to commercial and industrial loans and residential real estate loans which increased million and million  respectively 
home equity loans accounted for approximately percent of the increase in residential real estate loans 
the increase in period end loans was offset by a million decrease in consumer loans primarily related to a reduction in indirect lending 
approximately percent of the increase in loans from a year ago resulted from internally generated growth 
total real estate loans at december  were billion  up percent from year end amortizing permanent mortgages represented percent of the total real estate loan portfolio at year end 
residential mortgages increased million or percent 
real estate loans categorized as other are primarily amortizing commercial and industrial loans with maturities of less than five years 
approximately percent of all commercial real estate loans are owner occupied or have a major tenant national or regional company  which historically has resulted in a lower risk  provides financial stability and is less susceptible to economic swings

during  the amount of interest income actually recorded on non accrual loans was there were no foreign loans days past due as of december  loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non accrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
all non consumer loans days or more past due are classified as non accrual unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest income is not recognized until collected  and any previously accrued but uncollected interest is reversed 
a loan is considered to be restructured if it has been modified as to original terms  resulting in a reduction or deferral of principal and or interest as a concession to the debtor 
classification of an asset in the non performing category does not preclude ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 
at december   the corporation had  in loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties which had not been included in either of the non accrual or days past due loan categories 
management monitors such loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis 
allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses was million or percent of period end loans at december   compared to million or percent of period end loans at year end the allowance for possible loan losses as a percentage of non accrual loans was percent at december   compared with percent at december  the corporation recorded a million provision for possible loan losses during  compared to million and million recorded during and  respectively 
the provision is reflective of the continued growth in the loan portfolio 
the provision is also influenced by prior loan portfolio losses  the current condition of the loan portfolio both as to specific and in the aggregate  the present business economic environment within which the bank operates  and changes in other conditions which influence credit risk 
these other conditions include but are not limited to  the bank s lending policies and procedures dealing with underwriting standards  the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  the existence of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations  the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements  and changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors

allowance for possible loan losses as a percentage of year end loans  net of unearned discount there were no foreign charge offs in the corporation has certain lending policies and procedures in place which are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk 
these policies and procedures  some of which are described below  are reviewed regularly by senior management 
a reporting system supplements this review process by providing management and the board of directors with frequent reports related to loan production  loan quality  concentrations of credit  loan delinquencies and non performing and potential problem loans 
commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small  medium and large businesses 
the purpose of these loans vary from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
these loans are underwritten focusing on evaluating and understanding management s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand their business 
once it is determined management possess sound ethics and solid business acumen  current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability to repay their obligations as agreed upon 
in addition  collateral must be of good quality and single purpose projects are avoided 
underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with appropriate collateral margins 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions 
at december   the corporation had no concentration of commercial and industrial loans in any single industry that exceeded percent of total loans 
the diversity of the commercial real estate portfolio allows the corporation to reduce the impact of a decline in a single market or industry 
in addition to monitoring and evaluating commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography and risk grade criteria  management closely tracks its level of owner occupied commercial real estate loans versus non owner occupied loans 
additionally  the corporation utilizes the knowledge of third party experts to provide insight and guidance about the economic conditions and dynamics of the markets served by the corporation 
within the commercial real estate loan category  the corporation s primary focus has been the growth of loans secured by owner occupied properties 
at december   a majority of the corporation s commercial real estate loans were secured by owner occupied properties 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
consequently  these loans must withstand the analysis of a commercial loan and the underwriting process of a commercial real estate loan 
loans secured by non owner occupied commercial real estate are made to developers and builders who have a relationship with the corporation and who have a proven record of success 
these loans are underwritten through the use of feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim loan commitment from the corporation 
these loans are closely monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than the other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and the availability of long term financing 
the consumer loan portfolio has three distinct segments indirect consumer loans  which represent percent of the consumer loan portfolio  direct non real estate consumer loans  which represent percent of the portfolio and direct real estate consumer loans  which represent percent 
the indirect segment is composed almost exclusively of new and used automobile financing 
non real estate direct loans include automobile loans  unsecured revolving credit products  personal loans secured by cash and cash equivalents  and other similar types of credit facilities 
the direct real estate loans are primarily home equity  home improvement and residential lot loans 
effective january   in accordance with a constitutional amendment allowing for the existence of home equity loans in the state of texas  the corporation began offering home equity loans up to percent of the estimated value of the personal residence of the borrower less the balances on existing mortgage and home improvement loans 
as of december   home equity loans aggregated approximately million  and were originated for a general variety of purposes including education  business start ups  debt consolidation and automobile financing 
it is anticipated this product will continue to grow and eventually represent the largest distinct segment of the consumer portfolio 
to date the primary growth of this product has been from existing customers 
underwriting standards for this product are heavily influenced by the statute requirements  which include but are not limited to  maximum loan to value percentage  collection remedies  the number of such loans a borrower can have at one time and documentation requirements 
a computer based credit scoring analysis is used to supplement the consumer loan underwriting process 
to monitor and manage consumer loan risk  policies and procedures are developed and modified  as needed  jointly by line and staff personnel 
this activity  coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers  minimizes the risk 
additionally  trend and outlook reports are provided to senior management on a frequent basis to aid in planning 
the corporation has an independent loan review division that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis 
results of these reviews are presented to senior management and the board of directors 
loan review s function complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel as well as the corporation s policies and procedures 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review and or bank examiners are charged off 
furthermore  consumer loan accounts are charged off automatically based on regulatory requirements 
an allowance for possible loan losses is maintained in an amount which  in management s judgment  provides an adequate reserve to absorb potential loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio
