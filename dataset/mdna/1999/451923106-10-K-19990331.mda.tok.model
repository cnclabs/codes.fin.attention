such fluctuations may result from numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenues earned under existing or future collaborative relationships or joint ventures  if any  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of compounds  the progress of the company s drug development programs  the receipt of regulatory approvals  acquisitions  the timing of start up expenses for new facilities  changes in the company s mix of services  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competing products and technologies and the timing and availability of financing for the company  including existing or future strategic alliances and joint ventures with third parties 
in addition  with respect to the company s contract research services revenues  fluctuations may result due to a number of factors  including the commencement  completion or cancellation of large contracts and progress of ongoing contracts 
ilex believes that comparisons of its quarterly and annual historical results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
income taxes the availability of the nol carryforward to reduce us federal taxable income is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  in the event of an ownership change as defined in section of the code 
the company experienced a change in ownership interest in excess of percent as defined under the code upon the consummation of its offering of series b convertible preferred stock 
the company does not believe that this change in ownership significantly impacts the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of december   because the amount of the annual limitation under the code of such carryforwards is in excess of the total amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company did not experience a change in control under the code as the result of its initial public offering 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
liquidity and capital resources ilex has financed its operations primarily through the sale of its capital stock  through development and licensing fee revenues provided by its collaborative partners under its collaborative agreements and through fee for service or participatory revenues pursuant to contracts with its cro clients 
the company receives payments under collaborative agreements primarily in the form of development funding  milestone payments  if milestones are achieved  and royalties  if products are commercialized 
to date  the majority of the company s expenditures have been for research and development activities  including associated general and administrative expense and losses incurred by joint ventures 
ilex expects research and development expenses to increase for the next several years as its development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses necessary to support such expanded programs are also expected to increase over the next several years 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
the company expects such amounts to be used primarily to support continued research and development of its compounds  expand its cro services business  for general and administrative expenses and for other general corporate purposes 
at december   the company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
on march   the company sold million of common stock as part of an agreement to develop an oncology compound 
during  the company guaranteed a  line of credit for pfk  its european affiliate 
the guarantee is limited for a period of two years beginning in july and ending in june if the guarantee comes to redemption  the company will automatically obtain an additional percent ownership interest in pfk 
during  the company guaranteed a million line of credit for crg  an oncology site management organization 
the guarantee is limited for a period of three years beginning in may and ending in may if the guarantee comes to redemption  the company will obtain an ownership interest in crg in accordance with the guarantee agreement 
ilex s future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of its non clinical and clinical testing  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or termination of existing collaborative arrangements  the ability of the company to establish  maintain and avoid termination of collaborative arrangements  and the purchase of capital equipment and acquisitions of compounds  technologies or businesses 
the company s cash requirements are expected to continue to increase each year as it expands its activities and operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever be able to generate product revenue or achieve or sustain profitability 
the company expects its cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be adequate to cover all of its obligations for the next year 
year compliance the year issue concerns the potential exposures related to the automated generation of business and financial misinformation resulting from the application of computer programs which have been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the application year of business transactions 
the company s information technology management has conducted a comprehensive assessment of the company s computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year  and has determined that no material changes are required for the company s computer systems to be year compliant 
as such  the company believes that  based upon currently available information  it will incur no material costs associated with becoming year compliant 
the company is completing its confirmation of the year readiness of its material customers  service providers  key licensees  and its material vendors 
failure of the company  its software providers or the company s customers or vendors to adequately address the year issue could result in misstatement of reported financial information  scientific data or otherwise materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the above year disclosure constitutes a year readiness disclosure as defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act which was signed into law on october  such act provides added protection from liability for certain public and private statements concerning a company s year readiness
