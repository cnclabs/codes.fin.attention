the company has incurred significant operating losses since its formation in and has not earned a profit since its inception 
these operating losses and failure to be profitable have been due mainly to the significant amount of money that the company has had to spend on research and development

the conversion price was set based on of the initial fixed price of  which was set as the average closing bid price of the common stock during the trading days ended june  the variable price will be equal to the average of the lowest closing bid prices for the common stock during the trading days immediately preceding a conversion date 
if all the series f stock had been converted as of september   the company would have been required to issue approximately  shares of common stock 
under certain circumstances and at certain prices  the company may elect to redeem any shares of series f stock 
under certain circumstances  the company may require the investors to convert their series f stock

however  if the unavailability of the registration statement is not the result of the company s failure to use its best efforts  then  if the holders exercise their redemption rights  the company may  in lieu of redemption  y pay a penalty of per day of the stated value of  per share plus the accretion of per annum for a maximum of days in any day period  and z readjust the initial fixed price to of the lowest variable price during the period commencing on the day the registration statement became unavailable and ending on the day the registration statement is again available for use

because the market price of the common stock is subject to fluctuation  the company agreed  pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement  to register for resale by the investors at least of the number of shares of common stock that would be issuable if all the series f stock were converted as of the date of the filing of the registration statement and  thereafter  maintain the registration of at least of the number of shares of common stock that would be issuable if all the series f stock were then converted 
the registration statement currently in effect covers  shares of common stock 
if the registration statement is insufficient to permit the resale by the investors of all the common shares issuable upon conversion of the series f stock  the investors  in addition to any other remedies  have the right to require the company to redeem all or any portion of the remaining outstanding shares of series f stock at a price equal to the greater of of the stated value of  per share plus the accretion of per annum and the value of the common stock which would have been issued upon conversion as well as pay to them a penalty of per share of series f stock for each day that sales cannot be made 
the registration statement would not cover a sufficient number of shares to permit the investors to resell all the shares they could acquire upon conversion if the variable price is less than approximately which threshold will increase over time due to the accretion to the stated value 
the common stock in the recent past has traded below this price 
the company has received a waiver  dated october   from the holders of the series f stock with respect to the rights discussed above either to require redemption or to receive penalties conditioned upon the company a filing a registration statement  on or before november   covering at least of the number of shares of common stock that would be issuable if all the series f stock were converted as of the date of the filing of the registration statement and b having such registration statement declared effective on or before december  however  if failure of the registration statement to be declared effective by december  is not the result of the company s failure to use its best efforts  then  if the holders exercise their redemption rights  the company may  in lieu of redemption  y pay a penalty of per day of the stated value of  per share plus the accretion of per annum for a maximum of days in any day period  and z readjust the initial fixed price to of the lowest variable price during the period commencing on the day the registration statement became unavailable for sale of all the shares and ending on the day the registration statement is again available for use for sale of all the shares 
in addition  notwithstanding whether or not the company has used its best efforts  if the registration statement is not filed by november  and declared effective by december   the investors also will be entitled to the per day penalty discussed above accruing from the first day that the company was in breach of such registration obligation  which penalties would be significant 
the company intends to file the registration statement on or before november  and to use its best efforts to have it declared effective on or before december  while the new registration statement will cover a significant number of additional shares  the company would not be required to issue any shares which are the subject of this additional registration statement unless the variable price at the time of conversion is below increased over time due to the accretion to the stated value 
the company will also continue its discussions with the investors concerning a possible restructuring of certain other terms of the series f stock 
however  there can be no assurance that any restructuring can be obtained upon terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if the company were required to redeem the series f stock or make any of the penalty payments  it may not have the financial ability to make such payments 
even if the company did have the financial ability to redeem the series f stock or pay the required penalties  such payment could significantly and adversely affect its financial condition and deplete its cash resources 
as of october   shares of the series f stock had been converted into  shares of common stock 
if all the remaining outstanding shares of series f stock had been converted as of october   the company would have been required to issue approximately  additional shares of common stock

the company s liquid asset position  as measured by its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  was  at june   representing an increase of  from june  it is anticipated that working capital and cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will decrease during fiscal year as a result of planned operating expenses and capital expenditures  offset in part by projected revenues from product sales in the u 
s 
and europe 
however  there can be no assurance  as to the amount of revenues  if any  these products will provide 
in april  the company implemented a cost reduction program which the company anticipates saving approximately million during the next months 
as part of such program  the workforce was reduced by twelve employees  for which the company incurred severance expense of approximately  to date  the company has not generated positive cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its existing working capital should be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements through fiscal year based on reduced spending levels  if necessary 
however  the company s working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and there is no assurance that such factors will not have a negative impact on the company s liquidity 
principal among these are the success of its product commercialization and selling products  the technological advantages and pricing of the company s products  and access to capital markets that can provide the company with the resources when necessary to fund its strategic priorities 
without a significant increase in product revenues or other infusion of capital  the company will be required to significantly reduce its operating expenses  including the amount of resources devoted to marketing and sales  product development and clinical trials  which could have a significant and adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that it will require additional financial resources by the beginning of fiscal year in order for it to continue its projected levels of research and development and clinical trials of its proposed products and regulatory filings for new indications of existing products 
there can no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the company at all or on terms it finds acceptable or that the terms of such financing will not cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
the company intends to supplement its financial resources from time to time as market conditions permit through additional financing and through collaborative marketing and distribution agreements 
the company continues to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of its proprietary technology 
at the present time  the company is unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements

based on this review  the company is implementing a plan to achieve year compliance which the company expects to complete by october  the company believes that it will achieve year compliance in a manner which will be non disruptive to its operations 
in addition  the company has commenced work on various types of contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems  suppliers and other third parties which the company expects to complete by october  year compliance should not have a material adverse effect on the company  including the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
the company has incurred approximately  of costs to date related to year the company estimates the additional cost of its year efforts to be approximately  based on management s current assessment and is subject to change 
this additional cost will mainly consist of replacing its current telecommunication system and upgrading certain equipment 
however  the company may encounter problems with supplier and or revenue sources which could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
the company cannot accurately predict the occurrence and or outcome of any such problems  nor can the dollar amount of such problems be estimated 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year compliance by a third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company
