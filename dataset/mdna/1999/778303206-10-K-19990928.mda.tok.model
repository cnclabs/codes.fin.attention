overview the company s software product license revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  such factors as overall trends in the united states and international economies  new product introductions by the company  hardware vendors and other software vendors as well as customer buying patterns 
because the company typically ships software products within a short period after orders are received  and therefore maintains a relatively small backlog  any weakening in customer demand can have an almost immediate adverse impact on revenues and operating results 
moreover  a substantial portion of the revenues for each quarter is attributable to a limited number of sales and tends to be realized in the latter part of the quarter 
thus  even short delays or deferrals of sales near the end of a quarter can cause substantial fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
finally  certain agreements signed during a quarter may not meet the company s revenue recognition criteria resulting in deferral of such revenue to future periods 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of the recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variation in operating results from quarter to quarter

year implications overview the year issue arises because certain electronic data processing systems use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year which may preclude proper date recognition after december  during fiscal and  the company empowered key individuals as responsible for identifying and resolving year dysfunction 
these efforts include identification and review of internal operating systems and applications  customer projects and services  and discussions with suppliers to the business 
at this time  based upon the efforts taken to date and those yet to be taken  the company does not expect any disruptions in its business operations and  therefore  does not anticipate any material negative effect upon its revenues or earnings as a result of the year issue 
remediation costs for problems identified thus far are not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
the company has established a timetable for resolving year issues so as not to interrupt ongoing operations 
the company s state of readiness the year project plan  including assessment  improvement  testing and implementation  has been established 
the implementation phase is complete and should be finalized in september upon receipt of all remaining supplier year readiness inquiries and completed migration of certain internal systems 
assessment of the year compliance of third parties with whom the company has material relationships is in process 
the company s material third party relationships include the following a software vendors the company has upgraded all purchased software to a year compliant version and has completed the testing phase  b equipment vendors the response to the year readiness inquiries from equipment vendors  which includes all embedded chip equipment  is at  and c service providers the response to the year readiness inquiries from third party service providers  which includes utilities  phone service and all facility related services  is at 
thus far  the responses received  from the company s third party vendors and suppliers indicate compliance on or before november the preliminary assessment of internal information technology and non information technology systems has been completed 
internal non compliant items have been identified and prioritization of internal non compliant items is in process 
a system for tracking remediation has been established and non compliant items identified are expected to be completed in september based on the findings of the planning and assessment phases completed to date  the company does not believe independent verification or validation processes will be necessary 
costs to address the company s year issues the current estimate of the cost of remediation and equipment and software replacement ranges between  and  of which approximately  has been incurred to date  and is summarized as follows code modification and testing  personal computer  software and other upgrades  less than of the product development for and has been allocated for code modification 
such costs are funded through cash flows from operations and are expensed as incurred 
the personal computer and purchased software upgrades are costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and are  therefore  typically capitalized costs 
risks of the company s year issues and the company s contingency plans a most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is not known at this time 
this determination will be made after the receipt of the remaining material third party questionnaires 
however  the shipment of software to customers is expected to continue with no interruption and no material loss of revenues is anticipated 
the year project has had minimal impact on the schedule of other major information technology projects 
the contingency plan  which is largely a subset of the company s existing disaster recovery plan  is designed to ensure that the necessary backup measures for computer processing are identified 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange the company has a world wide presence and as such maintains offices and derives revenues from sources overseas 
for fiscal  international revenues as a percentage of total revenues was approximately 
the company s international business is subject to typical risks of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in fiscal was not material 
interest rates the company s exposure to interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash equivalents and certain debt obligations 
the company invests in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
any interest earned on these investments is recorded as interest income on the company s statement of operations 
because of the short maturity of our investments  a near term change in interest rates would not materially effect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
certain of the company s debt obligations include a variable rate of interest 
a significant  near term change in interest rates could materially effect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
