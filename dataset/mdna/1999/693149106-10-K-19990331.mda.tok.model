year many companies may face a potentially serious information systems problem because their computer software applications and operational programs may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could force computers to either shut down or provide incorrect data or information causing a temporary inability to process transactions 
accordingly  a disruption of normal business activities may occur 
the company began the process of identifying the changes required to its computer programs and hardware in and has completed its year assessment consisting of an analysis of all information systems  data and voice networks  physical plants  rolling stock electronic systems and external suppliers and customers

the company s remaining subsidiaries are expected to convert to the year software version by june  the company has surveyed its major suppliers and customers as well as secondary suppliers and customers for their state of readiness 
major suppliers and customers whose responses indicate they may not be year compatible in a timely fashion are being monitored on a monthly basis

approximately of the questionnaires have been returned 
respondents have indicated that they are currently year compliant or will be well in advance of the year the company s contingency plans relative to the year have not been finalized 
these plans are evolving as the testing of systems progresses and the company s subsidiaries continue to convert to year compliant software 
during the testing and conversion phase scheduled for completion by june   management will develop and modify a worst case scenario contingency plan based on testing and conversion results 
the related costs and projected completion dates for year compatibility are based upon management s best estimates
