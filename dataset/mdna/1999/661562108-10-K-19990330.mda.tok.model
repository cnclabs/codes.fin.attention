increased local network service revenues were attributable to customer growth  growth in second lines and expanded penetration of enhanced services 
long distance and access services increased moderately due to the implementation of a toll savings plan in july  and rate decreases on interstate switched access revenues beginning january  the decrease in other operating revenues was primarily due to the cessation of operations and subsequent sale of mcsi on july  offset  in part  by the growth of internet access customers 
total operating revenues increased  during this change was principally due to increases in long distance and access services of   local network services of  and other operating revenues of  
higher long distance and access service revenues were generally the result of an increase in the number of customers and minutes of use 
however  the rate of increase slowed due to the introduction of an automatic savings plan in july  increased local network service revenues were attributable to customer growth  growth in second lines  expanded penetration of enhanced services and line rate increases for residential and business customers in several exchanges

stock sales 
as reported in its current report on form k  dated january   the registrant had an investment in the common stock of conquest telecommunications services corporation conquest  a non public company  engaged in the development and marketing of prepaid calling cards and other enhanced telecommunications services 
in  smartalk teleservices  inc smartalk  a public company  engaged  inter alia  in similar businesses  and conquest announced the proposed acquisition of conquest by smartalk

b liquidity and capital resources 
in  north pittsburgh exhausted the remaining unborrowed funds  which had first become available from the rural telephone bank in information relating to long term debt is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the registrant and its subsidiaries financed capital expenditures  debt service and dividend payments from internal sources from to in  north pittsburgh was granted approval for a loan from the federal financing bank ffb guaranteed by the rural utilities service in the maximum principal amount of million 
the maximum principal amount will be advanced periodically over a five year period  which began on january  to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas 
funds advanced in and were  and  respectively  with all final maturity dates of advances occurring on december  north pittsburgh established a line of credit in in the amount of million with the rural telephone finance cooperative that is available for general business purposes 
no borrowings have taken place against the line of credit 
capital expenditure commitments for the purchase and installation of new equipment at december  amounted to approximately million  with such amount being part of a construction program which is projected to be in excess of million 
management expects cash flows provided by operating activities and cash reserves in to be sufficient to service long term debt  to pay dividends and to finance approximately to of capital additions 
the balance of capital additions will be financed from new borrowings 
it is anticipated that future payments for long term debt service will be made from the same sources of internally generated funds 
capital additions beyond are anticipated to be internally financed 
temporary excess funds are invested in short term cash equivalents with maturity dates scheduled to coincide with tax payment due dates  debt principal payments  etc 
management expects to continue the investment of such excess funds in  which should enable north pittsburgh to satisfactorily meet all short term obligations 
c other information 
inflation and changing prices 
during the three most recent fiscal years  inflation and changing prices have not had a significant impact on net sales and on income from continuing operations 
regulatory assets 
management does not believe that the registrant has any significant regulatory assets or liabilities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
historically  the registrant has monitored closely the economic lives of plant in service and has adjusted depreciable lives as necessary to conform to generally accepted accounting principles 
alternative form of regulation petition 
as discussed in item c i  north pittsburgh  under chapter of the pennsylvania public utility code  filed a petition with the pa puc  on july   seeking approval of an alternative form of regulation to replace traditional rate base rate of return regulation or be subject to a show cause proceeding 
the petition also included a proposed network modernization plan 
in the filing  north pittsburgh proposed a price cap plan whereby rates for noncompetitive services are allowed to be increased based on an index that measures general economy wide price increases 
this petition is still pending before the pa puc and may be modified in the final order 
however  it is not possible at this time to determine the pa puc s disposition of this petition or the effect on north pittsburgh s financial position or results of operations 
federal and state regulatory proceedings 
the federal communications commission fcc continues to work on rulemakings that will further spell out the specifics of the telecommunications act of the act 
the pa puc must then finalize its course of action to fully implement the act  or to the extent possible and permissible  change the manner in which such regulations are implemented in pennsylvania before the impact on north pittsburgh  a rural telephone company under the act  can be fully understood and measured 
however  the clear intent of the act is to open up the local exchange market to competition 
the act appears to mandate  among other items  that north pittsburgh  at some point in time  permit the resale of its services at wholesale rates  provide number portability  if feasible  provide dialing parity  provide interconnection to any requesting carrier for the transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access and provide access to network elements 
the company joined with other rural companies in pennsylvania to file a petition with the pa puc requesting a temporary suspension of the interconnection requirements of section of the act for a two year period following resolution of the fcc s universal service and access reform orders 
the petition was filed february  and the pa puc approved the petition on july  this initial two year suspension expires july  in january   north pittsburgh filed for a one year extension of the suspension until july  a decision by the pa puc is expected in the second quarter of the act  fcc and pa puc regulatory proceedings and the thrust towards a fully competitive marketplace have created some uncertainty in respect to the levels of north pittsburgh s revenue growth in the future 
however  its unique location in a growing commercial residential suburban traffic corridor to the north of the city of pittsburgh  its state of the art switching transmission and transport facilities and its extensive fiber network place north pittsburgh in a solid position to meet competition and minimize any loss of revenues 
in addition  north pittsburgh continues to make its network flexible and responsive to the needs of its customers to meet competitive threats 
new services  access line growth and anticipated usage growth are expected to lessen or offset any reductions in north pittsburgh s revenue sources 
year a state of readiness 
the registrant has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of the work required in order to make its systems and infrastructure year compliant 
the registrant began work last year to prepare its information technology it and non information technology non it systems  including updating and or replacing existing legacy systems 
the registrant has formed a corporate year task force  which is responsible for all year activities and is being monitored by senior management and the board of directors 
there are six phases of the registrant s year program awareness  inventory  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the registrant has defined the six phases as follows awareness gain the commitment of management and staff to solving the problem 
this phase has been completed 
inventory conduct a thorough inventory of all hardware and software systems 
this phase will run until december  in order to maintain the inventory throughout the life of the project 
assessment and planning decide which systems to retire  repair or replace 
prepare contingency plans 
this phase has been completed 
renovation perform upgrades to hardware and software 
this phase is underway and is scheduled to be completed in june  the registrant has contracted to outsource certain operational support  billing and accounting systems to a third party vendor 
the software and hardware components of the systems selected have been certified as year compliant 
all mission critical systems are scheduled to be remediated by april  validation test and certify new and renovated systems 
this phase is underway and will continue through june  implementation and follow up new or renovated systems go into service 
this phase is scheduled to be completed in december   and will include the resolution of any outstanding problems 
this phase is currently underway 
the year project will extend until march  in order to address the leap day of february  and to address any outstanding issues 
the registrant s year issues related to third parties can be broken into two categories third party vendors who supply products to the registrant  and other telecommunications companies who provide joint service to our customers 
the third party vendors have been providing the registrant with year solutions on an on going basis 
year upgrades  repairs and testing are being performed as per vendor specifications 
other telecommunications service providers are implementing year programs in much the same fashion as the registrant and industry testing is being performed on an on going basis 
b cost to address year issues 
expenditures related to year remediation are not expected to exceed million 
these expenditures include costs related to the data processing transition plan  license fees for purchase of software and training and implementation costs 
a portion of these costs are being capitalized and will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset beginning in approximately the second quarter of  the anticipated completion date of the project 
the remainder of these costs will be expensed as incurred 
c risks of year issues 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is loss of services to other interconnecting companies which  unlike the registrant  will not have attained year compliance 
however  this is unlikely to occur since the interconnecting companies realize their responsibility to comply 
nevertheless  should this worst case scenario occur  the registrant will give customers the option of rerouting service to a working carrier 
d contingency plan 
the registrant has developed a corporate year contingency plan to cover its primary business activities 
this plan outlines the key areas of business  and the manner in which they will be supported in the event of a year failure 
this plan has been developed as a result of research into united states telephone association member telephone company responses to hurricanes  tornadoes  ice storms and other disasters 
the registrant has studied and modified these plans to cover operations during potential year related failures 
the registrant has also updated and revised the existing emergency response plan 
the registrant s emergency response plan will form the core of its contingency plan if a major service outage should occur 
tests of the registrant s contingency plan will be conducted during the second quarter of key components of the contingency plan are the preparations to revert to a manual operation  stockpiling and conservation of materials  increased staffing levels  data storage for processing at a later date  isolation of harmful network elements and positioning key personnel in areas where they will be most effective 
should there be a serious service affecting problem  the emergency response plan will be activated until all services are restored 
events  which could trigger activation of the emergency response plan  include widespread loss of gas or electric service  failures at various interconnecting companies or failure of internal switching or transmission systems 
new accounting pronouncements 
in june   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the registrant does not expect the pronouncement to impact the consolidated financial statements because the registrant has not entered intro derivative or hedging transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the registrant s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the registrant s investment portfolio and long term obligations 
the registrant does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the registrant places its investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure from any one issuer 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
the registrant has no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for long term debt obligations 
the registrant primarily enters into debt obligations to support capital expenditures 
the table below presents principal amounts and related average interest rates by year of maturity for the registrant s investment portfolio and debt obligations 
all temporary investments mature in days or less 
available for sale debt securities have maturities which range between and years 
there after total fv fixed debt         average rate temporary investments    average rate afs debt securities        average rate available for sale as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the registrant s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the registrant s borrowing and investing strategies at the time  and interest rates
