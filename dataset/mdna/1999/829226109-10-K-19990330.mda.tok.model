to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the company enters into interest rate derivative hedging agreements 
the company has entered into an additional derivative instrument to monetize the benefit of a call option on a portion of its outstanding indebtedness at interest rates prevailing at the time the company entered into the instrument 
this derivative instrument the treasury option derivative instrument exposes the company to market risk from a further decrease in interest rates  but the company believes that this risk is offset by the benefit to the company from reduced interest rate expense on a portion of its floating rate debt and the ability to call some of its indebtedness and replace it with debt at the lower prevailing interest rates 
finally  the company has entered put and call option derivative instruments relating to the company s class a common stock in order to hedge against the possible dilutive effects of employees exercising stock options pursuant to the company s stock option plans 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
with the exception of the company s treasury option derivative instrument described below  the company does not reflect the changes in fair market value related to derivative instruments in the accompanying financial statements 
interest rate risks the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which arises from its floating rate debt 
as of december   the company was obligated on billion of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate 
the company enters into interest rate derivative agreements to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the bank credit agreement  as amended and restated  requires the company to enter into interest rate protection agreements at rates not to exceed per annum as to a notional principal amount at least equal to of the term loan  revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes scheduled to be outstanding from time to time 
as of december   the company had several interest rate swap agreements which expire from july  to july  the swap agreements effectively set fixed rates on the company s floating rate debt in the range of to 
floating interest rates are based upon the three month london interbank offered rate libor rate  and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
settlements of these agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods 
the notional amounts related to these agreements were billion at december   and decrease to million through the expiration dates 
in addition  the company entered into floating rate derivatives with notional amounts totaling million 
based on the company s currently hedged position  billion or of the company s outstanding indebtedness is hedged

treasury option derivative instrument in august  the company entered into a treasury option derivative contract the option derivative 
the option derivative contract provides for an option exercise date of september   a notional amount of million and a five year treasury strike rate of 
if the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities is less than the strike rate on the option exercise date  the company would be obligated to pay five consecutive annual payments in an amount equal to the strike rate less the five year treasury rate multiplied by the notional amount beginning september  through september  if the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities is greater than the strike rate on the option exercise date  the company would not be obligated to make any payments 
upon the execution of the option derivative contract  the company received a cash payment representing an option premium of million which was recorded in other long term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets

the company has the ability to call the notes on september  the value of this call is determined by new issuance yields for senior subordinated debt at that time 
the value of this call rises when yields fall and falls when yields rise 
new issuance yields are based on a spread over treasury yields 
if the yield on five year treasuries remains below until september   the company expects to be able to call the notes and refinance at the lower prevailing rates  thus offsetting the effect of the payments required under the treasury option derivative 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company would be able to refinance the notes at such time at favorable interest rates 
senior subordinated notes the company is also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent it is required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred
