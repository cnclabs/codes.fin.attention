the after tax impact of nonrecurring expenses associated with merging the operations of onbancorp into the company during was million  representing of diluted earnings per share and of basic earnings per share 
net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in was  compared with in and in the return on average common stockholders equity was in  in and in excluding the impact of merger related expenses  the rates of return on average assets and average common equity in were and  respectively 
growth in average loans outstanding  including the impact of the billion of loans obtained on april  in the onbancorp acquisition  was the leading factor for a increase in taxable equivalent net interest income to million in from million in average loans totaled billion in  up from billion in similarly  average earning assets increased  to billion in from billion in an increase in average loans in was also the most significant factor for the rise in that year s net interest income from million in average loans and average earning assets in were billion and billion  respectively 
improvement in s net interest income resulting from asset growth was partially offset by a reduction of the company s net interest margin  or taxable equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
net interest margin in was  compared with in and in the provision for possible credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in net charge offs in were million  compared with million in and million in included in net charge offs were net consumer loan charge offs totaling million in  million in and million in net charge offs of credit card balances included in the consumer loan amounts were million in  million in  and million in as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs declined to

in and 
in in january  m t contributed appreciated investment securities with a fair value of million to an affiliated  tax exempt private charitable foundation 
as a result of this transfer  the company incurred charitable contributions expense of million and recognized tax exempt other income of million 
the transfer provided an income tax benefit of approximately million and  accordingly  resulted in an after tax increase in net income of million  or 
per diluted share 
excluding the effect of this transfer  noninterest income totaled million in  above the million in and above the million in approximately of the increase from to was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the onbancorp acquisition 
higher revenues from mortgage banking  trust activities and a bank owned life insurance program also contributed to the increases from prior years 
excluding million of expense related to the previously mentioned transfer of securities to an affiliated charitable foundation in  noninterest expense was million in  up from million in and from million in a million increase in amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible  million of nonrecurring merger related expenses and operating expenses related to the acquired operations of onbancorp significantly contributed to the increase in expenses from to expenses associated with expanding certain businesses providing loan and investment services contributed to the increase in expenses from and cash operating results as a result of the acquisition of onbancorp on april  and  to a significantly lesser extent  acquisitions of other entities in prior years  the company had recorded as assets at december  goodwill and core deposit intangible totaling million 
since the amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible does not result in a cash expense  m t believes that supplemental reporting of its operating results on a cash or tangible basis which excludes the after tax effect of amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and the related asset balances presents a relevant measure of financial performance and better reflects the cash return on the investments made by m t to improve and expand its franchise 
the supplemental cash basis data presented herein do not exclude the effect of other non cash operating expenses such as depreciation  provision for possible credit losses  or deferred income taxes associated with the results of operations 
excluding nonrecurring merger related expenses  cash net income was million in  up from million in on the same basis  diluted and basic earnings per share were and  respectively  up and  respectively  from and in in  cash net income was million while diluted and basic cash earnings per share were and  respectively

net interest income lending and funding activities net interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis increased to million in from million in this increase resulted from growth in average earning assets  which rose billion or to billion in from billion in taxable equivalent net interest income and average earning assets in were million and billion  respectively 
growth in average earning assets in was largely attributable to higher average loans and leases outstanding  which totaled billion in  up from billion in the primary reason for the higher loan balances in was the billion of loans obtained on april  from the onbancorp acquisition  including approximately million of commercial loans  million of commercial real estate loans  billion of residential mortgage loans and million of consumer loans 
partially offsetting these increases in average loans and leases was the impact of the july sale of m t s retail credit card business 
average credit card balances for were million  compared with million in and million in average loans in were higher than the billion in the accompanying table summarizes average loans and leases outstanding in and percentage changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio over the past two years 
loans secured by real estate  including outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit which are classified as consumer loans  represented approximately of the loan and lease portfolio during  up from in and at december   the company held approximately billion of commercial real estate loans  billion of consumer real estate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties and million of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit  compared with billion  billion and million  respectively  at december  commercial real estate loans originated by the company are predominately secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area  including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of new york city  and western new york  which includes buffalo  niagara falls  rochester and surrounding areas 
commercial real estate loans are also originated in the syracuse  albany  hudson valley and southern tier regions of new york state  as well as in northeastern pennsylvania 
most commercial real estate loans in the company s portfolio are either fixed rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining principal at maturity  often five years after loan origination  or adjustable rate loans 
for borrowers in good standing  the customer may extend the terms of the loan agreement for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest 
in recent years  in response to customer needs  the company has also originated fixed rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years 
in general  these loans have original maturity terms of approximately ten years 
the accompanying table presents commercial real estate loans at december  by geographic area  type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding 
of the billion of commercial real estate loans in the new york city metropolitan area  approximately were secured by multi family residential properties  by retail space and by office space 
the company s experience has been that office space and retail properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multi family residential properties 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of new york city area loans were for million or less  while loans of more than million made up approximately of the total 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties elsewhere in new york state tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business 
approximately of the aggregate dollar amount of loans in this segment of the portfolio were for million or less 
commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of new york state and outside of areas of neighboring states considered to be part of the new york city metropolitan area comprised of total commercial real estate loans 
amounts presented as construction lending in the accompanying table represent commercial construction loans for which the company has not committed to provide permanent financing 
such loans totaled million  or of total loans and leases at december  real estate loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaled billion at december   including approximately secured by properties located in new york state 
at december   million of residential real estate loans were held for sale by m t mortgage corporation  the company s mortgage banking subsidiary 
consumer loans and leases represented approximately of the average loan portfolio during  compared with in and in automobile loans and home equity loans and lines of credit represent the largest components of the consumer loan portfolio 
at december   of the automobile loan portfolio was to borrowers in new york state  while the remainder was largely to borrowers in pennsylvania 
automobile loans and leases are generally originated through dealers  however  all applications submitted by dealers are subject to the company s normal underwriting and loan approval procedures 
automobile loans and leases represented approximately of the company s average loan portfolio during  while no other consumer loan product represented more than 
due to poorer than expected results  during and the company terminated all of its co branded credit card programs and  as already discussed  sold its retail credit card business on july   including outstanding balances of approximately million 
the company s investment securities portfolio averaged billion in  billion in and billion in investment securities obtained in the acquisition of onbancorp added approximately million to the average balance during the size of the investment securities portfolio is influenced by such factors as demand for loans  which generally yield more than investment securities  ongoing repayments  the level of deposits  and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios 
the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  and shorter term us treasury notes 
when purchasing investment securities  the company considers its overall interest rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to prepayment and other risks assumed 
the company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates  actual or anticipated prepayments  or credit risk associated with a particular security 
money market assets  which are comprised of interest earning deposits at banks  interest earning trading account assets  federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities  averaged million in  compared with million in and million in core deposits represent the most significant source of funding to the company and generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities 
core deposits consist of noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts  savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under  the company s branch network is its principal source of core deposits 
certificates of deposit under  generated on a nationwide basis by m t bank  na are also included in core deposits 
average core deposits rose to billion in  up from billion in and billion in core deposits obtained on april  in the acquisition of onbancorp totaled approximately billion 
average core deposits of m t bank  na were million in  million in and million in funding provided by core deposits totaled of average earning assets in  compared with in and in an analysis of changes in the components of core deposits is presented in the accompanying table domestic time deposits of  or more  deposits originated through the company s offshore branch office  and brokered certificates of deposit also provide funding to the company 
domestic time deposits over  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  averaged billion in  compared with billion and million in and  respectively 
offshore branch deposits  comprised primarily of accounts with balances of  or more  averaged million in  compared with million in and million in brokered deposits averaged billion in and and billion in  and totaled billion at december  brokered deposits are used as an alternative to short term borrowings to lengthen the average maturity of interest bearing liabilities 
the weighted average remaining term to maturity of brokered deposits at december  was years 
however  certain of the deposits have provisions that allow early redemption 
nevertheless  in connection with the company s management of interest rate risk  interest rate swaps have been entered into under which the company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of the brokered deposits 
additional amounts of brokered deposits may be solicited in the future depending on market conditions and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time 
the company also uses borrowings from banks  securities dealers  the federal home loan banks fhlb and others as funding sources 
short term borrowings averaged billion in  million in and billion in in general  short term borrowings have been used to fund the company s discretionary investments in money market assets and investment securities  and  if necessary  to replace deposit outflows or provide funding for loan growth 
long term borrowings averaged million in  million in and million in long term borrowings include million of trust preferred securities issued by two special purpose entities formed by m t during the first half of and similar securities with a carrying value of million that were issued in the first quarter of by a special purpose entity formed by onbancorp 
further information regarding the trust preferred securities is provided in note of notes to financial statements 
average long term borrowings included amounts borrowed from the fhlb of million in and million in and  as well as million of subordinated capital notes issued in prior years by m t bank 
information regarding contractual maturities of long term borrowings is presented in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition to changes in the composition of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as described herein  net interest income is also affected by changes in interest rates and spreads 
the increase in net interest income resulting from growth in average earning assets in was partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest spread  or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest spread was in  compared with in the yield on earning assets decreased basis points hundredths of one percent to in from in lower yielding residential real estate loans  consumer loans and investment securities acquired in the onbancorp transaction  the july sale of the company s retail credit card business  and competitive pressure on interest rates charged for newly originated loans  particularly commercial loans and commercial real estate loans  contributed to the decline in yield 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  compared with in in  the net interest spread was  the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was 
generally higher prevailing interest rates and the effect of the previously discussed issuances of million of trust preferred securities during contributed to the increase in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in from interest free funds  consisting largely of noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity  contributed 
to net interest margin in  compared with 
in and 
in average interest free funds were billion in  billion in and billion in the decline in the contribution to net interest margin of interest free funds in from and was due  in part  to the goodwill and core deposit intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the onbancorp acquisition  which averaged million during  and the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance  which averaged million in  compared with million in and none in increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income  but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations 
these two noninterest earning assets mitigated much of the benefit derived from increases in noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity resulting from the onbancorp transaction 
future changes in market interest rates or spreads  as well as changes in the composition of the company s portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the company s net interest margin and net interest income 
management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under a number of different interest rate scenarios 
as part of the management of interest rate risk  the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of the loan and deposit portfolios 
revenue and expense arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields earned on assets or  as appropriate  the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
excluding forward starting swaps  the notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes as of december  was approximately billion 
in general  under the terms of these swaps  the company receives payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the swaps at fixed rates of interest and makes payments at variable rates 
however  under terms of million of swaps  the company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate 
to help manage exposure resulting from changing interest rates in future years  as of december   the company had also entered into forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million in which the company will pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate 
such forward starting swaps had no effect on the company s net interest income through december  the average notional amounts of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes and the related effect on net interest income and margin are presented in the accompanying table the company estimates that as of december  it would have received approximately million if all interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes had been terminated 
this estimated fair value of the interest rate swap portfolio results from the effects of changing interest rates and should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet and the company s overall interest rate risk profile 
changes in the estimated fair value of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
additional information about interest rate swaps is included in note of notes to financial statements 
provision for possible credit losses the provision for possible credit losses was million in  compared with million in and million in the purpose of the provision is to replenish or build the company s allowance for possible credit losses to a level necessary to maintain an adequate reserve position that reflects losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
net charge offs for were million  compared with million in and million in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 
in  
in and 
in nonperforming loans totaled million or 
of loans outstanding at december   compared with million or 
of loans a year earlier and million or 
at december  included in nonperforming loans at december  were million of loans obtained in the acquisition of onbancorp 
the allowance for possible credit losses was million or of net loans and leases at the end of  compared with million or at december  and million or at december  the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans at year end  and was  and  respectively 
the decline in the allowance as a percentage of total loans at december  as compared with prior years reflects management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  the july sale of the retail credit card business  and other factors 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing an ongoing evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  the economic environment in which borrowers operate  the level of delinquent loans and the value of any collateral 
significant loans are individually analyzed  while other smaller balance loans are evaluated by loan category 
impacting the assessment as of december  was the effect that volatile economic conditions in foreign markets were having on the domestic economy 
while the company s direct international exposure is not significant  volatile conditions in foreign markets can cause instability in the domestic economy 
given the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the company s loan portfolio  particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in new york state  in general  and in the new york city metropolitan area  in particular  coupled with the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area and significant growth in recent years in loans to individual consumers  management cautiously evaluated the impact of interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when assessing the adequacy of the company s allowance for possible credit losses as of december  based upon the results of such review  management believes that the allowance for possible credit losses at december  was adequate to absorb credit losses from existing loans and leases 
the accompanying table presents a comparative allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses for each of the past five year ends 
amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based upon management s classification of loans under the company s internal loan grading system and assessment of near term charge offs and losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by the company s internal loan review department and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable resulting from i comparatively poorer economic conditions and an unfavorable business climate in market regions served by the company  in particular areas of new york state outside of the new york city metropolitan area that have not experienced the same degree of economic growth evident in much of the rest of the country in recent years  ii portfolio concentrations regarding loan type  collateral type and geographic location  in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the new york city metropolitan area and other areas of new york state  iii the effect of expansion into new markets  including market areas of new york state and pennsylvania entered through the acquisition of onbancorp  and or new loan product types  including expansion of automobile loan and leasing activities in recent years  and  iv the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance 
nevertheless  the allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan category 
accordingly  the amounts presented in the table do not necessarily indicate future losses within the individual loan categories 
several factors influence the company s credit loss experience  including overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers  in general  and  due to the size of the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio  real estate valuations  in particular 
commercial real estate valuations include many assumptions and  as a result  can be highly subjective 
commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate and economic conditions  and  in many cases  the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property 
nonperforming commercial real estate loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december   thousand of nonperforming commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in the new york city metropolitan area  compared with million and million at december  and  respectively

net credit card and indirect automobile loan charge offs during were million and million  respectively  compared with million and million  respectively  in and million and million  respectively  in higher levels of consumer bankruptcies in recent years were a contributing factor to the higher rate of consumer loan charge offs experienced which  in general  was consistent with trends reported by other financial institutions

of outstanding consumer loans at december   compared with million or 
at december  and million or 
at december  commercial real estate loans secured by multi family properties in the new york city metropolitan area represented of loans outstanding at december  however  the company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded of total loans at december  furthermore  the company had no exposure to less developed countries  and only million of foreign loans in total 
assets acquired in settlement of defaulted loans totaled million at december   compared with million a year earlier and million at the end of other income other income in included million of tax exempt income resulting from the previously noted transfer of appreciated investment securities to an affiliated  tax exempt charitable foundation 
excluding that income  other income rose to million in from million in approximately of this increase was attributable to revenues related to operations and or market areas associated with the former onbancorp

residential mortgage loans serviced for others were billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
capitalized servicing assets were million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  service charges on deposit accounts rose to million in from million in  and from million in fees for services provided to customers in the areas formerly served by onbancorp contributed approximately three fourths of the increase from trust income increased to million in from million in and from million in the increase from was due largely to higher revenues for investment management and personal trust services 
merchant discount and other credit card fees in totaled million  compared with million in and million in as noted earlier  during and the company terminated all of its co branded credit card programs  and on july  sold its retail credit card business 
total credit card fees included in merchant discount and credit card fees in were approximately million  compared with approximately million in and million in through the date of sale  the results of operations of the retail credit card business in  including internal allocations of the provision for possible credit losses  interest expense and other expenses  were essentially break even 
on the same basis  the company s retail credit card business incurred losses of approximately million in each of and trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of million in  million in and million in excluding the effect of the contribution of securities to the affiliated foundation  other revenues from operations increased to million in  compared with million in and million in such amounts include million and million in and  respectively  from tax exempt income earned from increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
there was no such income in also included in other revenues from operations were revenues from the sales of mutual funds and annuities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other items contributing to the increase in as compared with include a million gain from the sale of the retail credit card business and higher revenues for automated teller machine service fees and for credit and other services provided to borrowers and other customers 
income earned from venture capital and other investments in also contributed to the increase in other revenues from operations as compared with other expense excluding million of nonrecurring merger related expenses in  amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible of million in  million in and million in  and million of expense related to the previously discussed transfer of securities to an affiliated charitable foundation in  other expense totaled million in  higher than million in and higher than million in expenses related to the acquired operations of onbancorp significantly contributed to the higher expense level in however  since all operating systems and support operations of onbancorp have been converted to or combined with those of the company  the company s operating expenses cannot be precisely divided between or attributed directly to operations acquired from onbancorp or to the company as it existed prior to the merger 
salaries and employee benefits expense was million in  higher than the million in and higher than the million in salaries and employee benefits relating to the operations acquired from onbancorp largely contributed to the increased expense level in over merit salary increases and expenses associated with incentive compensation plans also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting the impact of these higher expenses was a million decrease in from for expense associated with stock appreciation rights 
factors contributing to the higher expenses from to were higher incentive based compensation arrangements  including stock appreciation rights  and merit salary increases 
the number of full time equivalent employees was  at december   compared with  at december  and  at december  excluding one time merger related expenses and the already discussed charitable contributions expense in  and amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible  nonpersonnel expense totaled million in  higher than million in each of and the increases from were largely the result of expenses related to the acquired operations of onbancorp plus an increase in amortization of capitalized servicing rights

liquidity refers to the company s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy demands for loans and deposit withdrawals  to fund operating expenses  and to be used for other corporate purposes 
liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ 
historically  the company s core deposits have provided a significant source of funds 
such deposits are generated from a large base of consumer  corporate and institutional customers  which over the past several years has become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the company s businesses 
nevertheless  in recent years the company has faced increased competition in offering services and products from a large array of financial market participants  including banks  thrifts  mutual funds  securities dealers and others 
as a result  and consistent with banking industry experience in general  the company has experienced a reduction in the percentage of earning assets funded by core deposits 
core deposits financed of the company s earning assets at december   compared with and at december  and  respectively 
funding from core deposits is supplemented by the company with various wholesale borrowings  including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and brokered certificates of deposit 
additionally  m t bank has a credit facility with the fhlb aggregating billion of which borrowings outstanding at december  and totaled billion and million  respectively 
such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities 
although informal and sometimes reciprocal  sources of funding are available to the company through various arrangements for unsecured short term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions 
in addition to deposits and borrowings  other sources of liquidity include maturities of money market assets and investment securities  repayments of loans and investment securities  and cash generated from operations  such as fees collected for services 
m t s primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses  stockholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries  which are subject to various regulatory limitations 
however  during m t issued junior subordinated debt to two special purpose subsidiaries which provided a substantial portion of m t s funding needs during and additional information regarding the junior subordinated debt is included in note of notes to financial statements 
m t also maintains a million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank  all of which was available for borrowing at december  the company expects to have access to sufficient liquid assets to fund the cash portion of the previously discussed acquisition of fnb and  accordingly  management does not anticipate engaging in any activities  either currently or in the long term  which would cause a significant strain on liquidity at either m t or its subsidiary banks 
furthermore  management closely monitors the company s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of the company s financial instruments 
the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk 
the core banking activities of lending and deposit taking expose the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
as a result of interest rate risk  net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates 
the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future years under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
management s philosophy toward positioning the company for interest rate movements is to attempt to limit the variability of net interest income 
the balances of both on and off balance sheet financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities  anticipated prepayments of mortgage related assets and expected maturities of investment securities  loans and deposits 
management supplements the modeling technique described above with analyses of market values of the company s financial instruments 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately billion  including approximately million of forward starting swaps 
information about interest rate swaps entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under net interest income lending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements 
the asset liability committee  which includes members of senior management  monitors the company s interest rate sensitivity with the aid of a computer model that considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  as well as statistically derived interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments  including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities 
when deemed prudent  management has taken action  and intends to do so in the future  to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or off balance sheet financial instruments 
possible actions include  but are not limited to  changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products  modifying the composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and entering into or modifying existing interest rate swap agreements 
the accompanying table as of december  and displays the estimated impact on net interest income from non trading financial instruments resulting from changes in interest rates during the first modeling year 
the calculation of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income is based upon many assumptions  including prepayments of mortgage related assets  cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non trading purposes  loan and deposit volumes and pricing  and deposit maturities 
the company also assumes gradual changes in rates of and basis points up and down during a twelve month period 
as these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  as well as any actions  such as those previously described  which management may take to counter these changes 
in accordance with industry practice  cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames  as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes  are presented in the accompanying table management believes this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities equally nor  as assumed in the table  on the contractual maturity or repricing date 
furthermore  this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities  projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the company is likely to implement 
the company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to profit from perceived market opportunities 
trading activities are conducted utilizing financial instruments that include forward and futures contracts related to foreign currency exchange and mortgage backed securities  us treasury and other government securities  mortgage backed securities and interest rate contracts  such as swaps 
the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions 
the amounts of gross and net trading positions as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the company are subject to a well defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by the asset liability committee 
the notional amounts of interest rate and foreign currency trading contracts totaled 
billion and billion  respectively  at december  and billion and billion  respectively  at december  the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
however  the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities were million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  given the company s policies  limits and positions  management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from trading activities was not material as of december  and additional information related to trading derivative contracts is included in note of notes to financial statements 
capital stockholders equity at december  was billion or of total assets  compared with billion or at december  and million or at december  stockholders equity per share was at december   an increase of from at december  and from at december  excluding goodwill and core deposit intangible  net of applicable tax effect  tangible equity per share was at december   compared with at december  and at december  the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was  and in  and  respectively 
to complete the acquisition of onbancorp on april   m t issued  shares of common stock to former holders of onbancorp common stock and assumed employee stock options for  shares of m t common stock resulting in additions to stockholders equity of million and million  respectively 
stockholders equity at december  reflected a gain of million  or 
per share  for the net after tax impact of unrealized gains on investment securities classified as available for sale  compared with unrealized gains of million  or per common share  at december  and a reduction for unrealized losses of million  or 
per common share  at december  the unrealized gains at december  represent the amount by which the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale exceeded amortized cost  net of applicable income taxes 
the market valuation of investment securities should be considered in the context of the entire balance sheet of the company 
with the exception of investment securities classified as available for sale  trading account assets and liabilities  and residential mortgage loans held for sale  the carrying values of financial instruments in the balance sheet are generally not adjusted for appreciation or depreciation in market value resulting from changes in interest rates 
cash dividends on m t s common stock of million were paid in  compared with million in and million in in the second quarter of m t s quarterly common stock dividend rate was increased to per share from 
per share 
in total  dividends per common share increased to in from in and in in october  m t announced a plan to repurchase and hold as treasury stock up to  shares of common stock for reissuance upon the possible future exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   m t had repurchased  common shares pursuant to such plan at an average cost of per share 
including prior repurchase plans completed in and  m t repurchased common shares totaling  in   in and  in the total cost of these common stock repurchases was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain core capital and total capital ratios of at least and  respectively  of risk adjusted total assets 
in addition to the risk based measures  federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of of the quarterly average of total assets 
core capital includes the million of trust preferred securities issued by two special purpose entities formed by m t during and similar securities having a carrying value of million issued by a special purpose entity formed by onbancorp 
as of december  total capital further included million of the subordinated notes issued by m t bank in prior years 
the capital ratios of the company and its banking subsidiaries  m t bank and m t bank  na  as of december  and are presented in note of notes to financial statements 
the rate of internal capital generation  or net income excluding the after tax effect of gains or losses from sales of bank investment securities less dividends paid expressed as a percentage of average total stockholders equity  was in  in and in year initiatives the year problem relates to the ability of computer systems  including those in non information technology equipment and systems computer systems  to distinguish date data between the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year problem 
the risk for the company is that all of the corrections and testing will not be adequately completed in time for its own computer systems and or for those of third parties doing business with or providing services to the company 
addressing the year problem requires that the company identify  remediate and test its computer systems that have date sensitive functions 
as part of this process  the company has identified those of its computer systems which  if uncorrected  would have a material adverse impact on the company s customers  the company s compliance with applicable regulations  or the company s financial statements mission critical systems 
management believes that approximately seventy five percent of all of the company s mission critical systems are year compliant 
management anticipates that testing of year renovations related to the company s remaining mission critical systems will be substantially complete by march  the company also expects that its remaining computer systems will be year compliant before the new millennium 
the company could also be adversely affected if its vendors  customers and other third parties that supply or rely on data processing systems are not year compliant prior to the end of the company  therefore  is working with its data processing vendors and providing information to its commercial customers regarding year issues 
specifically  lending officers have been trained to address year issues with customers  including assessing customer needs for year compliance 
the company is also addressing the year risks posed by other third parties such as its funds providers and capital market asset management counterparties 
lack of corrective measures by government agencies or service providers which the company either receives data from or provides data to could also have a negative impact on the company s operations 
notwithstanding the company s efforts  a risk remains due to the uncertainty that such third parties will be year compliant before the new millennium 
as a result  it is possible that if all aspects of year issues are not adequately resolved by each of the third parties referred to above  the company s future business operations  financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
for example  the credit quality of commercial and other loans may be adversely affected by the failure of customers operating systems resulting from year issues 
management is monitoring the company s progress regarding year issues 
the company has established a year steering committee consisting of senior members of management to oversee all year activities 
in conjunction with its assessment of the company s year remediation plans and the remediation efforts of third parties such as those described in the preceding paragraph  management is in the process of developing appropriate contingency plans to mitigate risks associated with critical year issues that could arise during the period leading up to and after january  these contingency plans  which are expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter of  will include business resumption contingency plans 
through december   the company has spent approximately million including approximately million during in addressing its potential year problems 
management believes that the company is continuing to devote appropriate financial and human resources to resolve its year issues in a timely manner  and currently estimates that it will expend an additional to million in order to address year issues 
a majority of the company s past and future year costs relate to internal costs and constitute resources that would otherwise have been reallocated within the company 
such reallocation has not had a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations  nor is it expected to have a material adverse impact in future periods 
costs associated with year issues are recognized in expense as incurred

in total  earning assets averaged billion in the final quarter of  up from billion in the corresponding quarter 
the yield on earning assets decreased to in the final quarter from in the year earlier period due  in part  to lower yielding loans and investment securities acquired in the onbancorp transaction 
the impact of lower interest rates in the fourth quarter of as compared with the corresponding period in  coupled with competitive pressure on interest rates charged for newly originated loans during much of  particularly commercial loans and commercial real estate loans  also contributed to the decline in yield 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in s final quarter from in the year earlier period due to generally lower market interest rates that resulted following actions taken by the federal reserve to lower interest rates in the third and fourth quarters of the resulting net interest spread was in the recent quarter  compared with in the fourth quarter of similarly  net interest margin decreased to in the fourth quarter of from in the year earlier quarter

net charge offs as an annualized percentage of average loans and leases were 
in the recent quarter  down from 
in the corresponding quarter 
including the impact of the onbancorp acquisition  other income rose to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the year earlier quarter  largely due to increases of million in the change in cash surrender value associated with bank owned life insurance  million in service charges on deposit accounts  and million in mortgage banking revenues 
other expense was million in the fourth quarter of  up from million in the fourth quarter of  due largely to a million increase in amortization of goodwill and core deposit intangible and higher operating expense levels resulting from combining onbancorp with the company 
segment information the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
an entity that elects to apply hedge accounting is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method it will use for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the entity s approach to managing risk 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  initial application of sfas no 
should be as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal quarter  on that date  hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the provisions of the statement 
early application of all of the provisions of sfas no 
is encouraged  but is permitted only as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter that began after issuance of the statement 
sfas no 
should not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the company intends to adopt sfas no 
as of january   however  it has not yet quantified the financial statement impact of adoption  nor has the method of adoption been determined 
the company anticipates that adoption of sfas no 
could increase the volatility of reported earnings and stockholders equity and could result in the modification of certain data processing systems and hedging practices 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no
