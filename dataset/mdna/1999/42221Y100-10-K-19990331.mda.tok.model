overview hie develops and markets eai solutions and provides related implementation  maintenance and support services to companies seeking to connect their disparate software applications and data repositories 
hie has served customers in the healthcare market since and has recently begun providing its software and services to financial institutions 
hie s products are designed to enable companies to more effectively administer the disparate elements of their it systems by linking both new and existing software to form a more efficient it environment 
the company was incorporated in georgia in june as healthdyne information enterprises  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of healthdyne  inc  and was initially focused on providing enterprise wide clinical information management solutions for healthcare delivery networks 
in november  healthdyne  inc distributed all of the outstanding shares of hie common stock in a spin off 
in october  hie redefined its strategic direction to focus on providing software products and services to support the enterprise wide integration of information 
as part of its new strategic focus  hie acquired hublink  inc  a privately held integration software product company  in may in a pooling of interests transaction and sold assets related to certain non strategic consulting services to superior consultant holdings corporation in december hie sells its software products to distributors and application vendors  as well as directly to end users 
software license sales typically are full use licenses  which provide the end user with full functionality of the product 
less expensive limited use licenses are also available  which restrict the functionality of the product or the number of application interfaces 
a typical distributor or application vendor agreement includes an initial purchase of software for resale with additional licenses purchased periodically during the term of the agreement 
sales directly to end users are generally for perpetual licenses for a one time  up front fee 
hie recognizes revenue from two primary sources  software licenses and services 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the criteria set forth in statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants

hie also periodically borrows under established lines of credit for working capital purposes 
prior to the completion of the follow on offering in november  hie used its available cash and cash flow from operating activities to pay acquired debt and acquisition financing related debt  as those obligations matured 
subsequent to the follow on offering in november  hie used   and  of cash during november  april and september  respectively  to prepay a portion of long term debt at a discount 
hie also invested  during to satisfy its funding commitment to criterion health strategies  inc hie plans to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the equity sources referred to above to pay debt as it matures and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
hie had working capital of million at december  compared to working capital of million at december  the increase in working capital was generated primarily through operating earnings and the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in operating activities increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities was attributable to an increase in accounts receivable offset by an increase in deferred revenue and net earnings for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of hie s sale of the integrated services group in the fourth quarter of  which generated million in cash

net cash used in financing activities decreased to million used in the year ended december  from million provided in the year ended december  principal payments on long term debt increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was offset by issuances of common stock and borrowings under line of credit facilities 
hie s net borrowings from its line of credit facilities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in august  hie entered into a new line of credit agreement providing for borrowings of up to million  with the maximum amount available under the line at any time dependent on hie s accounts receivable

these leases expire at various dates through at december   hie had million in outstanding capital and operating lease obligations 
hie believes that currently available cash  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing or future credit facilities will be sufficient to meet hie s requirements for at least the next twelve months 
hie may seek to raise additional financing to support expansion  develop new or enhanced applications and services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or take advantage of favorable market conditions 
in such event  or if hie s cash needs or plans change  hie may seek to raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
there can be no assurance  however  that hie will be able to raise any additional amounts on reasonable terms  if at all 
backlog as of december   hie s revenue backlog totaled million compared with million as of december  revenue backlog is comprised of maintenance fees paid in advance  contracted for implementation services and other unearned revenue relating to accepted orders or agreements for the delivery of hie s products and services 
revenue included in backlog is generally expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
generally  customer orders and agreements included in backlog are subject to cancellation and there can be no assurance that backlog will be realized 
consequently  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future results 
recent accounting pronouncement statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  was issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants in october  effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  on january   hie adopted sop in accordance with sop  revenue from the license of software is generally recognized upon shipment of the software and fulfillment of acceptance terms  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
service revenue is recognized as the work is performed or  in the case of a fixed fee contract  on the percentage of completion basis  even though some services are prepaid 
the implementation of this statement has not had a material impact on hie s consolidated financial statements 
however  sop includes restrictive provisions regarding specific terms of software arrangements which  if present  require deferral of revenue recognition beyond the point of delivery of the software 
future competitive conditions may arise that could necessitate changes in hie s business practices and the contract terms of its software arrangements 
such changes may require deferral of revenue recognition and periodic operating results could be adversely affected 
year the year issue refers generally to the data structure and processing problem that may prevent systems from properly processing date sensitive information when the year changes to the year issue affects it systems  such as computer programs and various types of electronic equipment that process date information by using only two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year  and thus may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the issue also affects some non it systems  such as devices which rely on a microcontroller to process date information 
the year issue could disrupt a company s operations by generating erroneous data or causing system failures or miscalculations 
state of readiness hie has formed a year task force which is systematically evaluating its systems  products and key external relationships to ascertain material year issues and solutions 
hie s year readiness program has two phases assessment and remediation including modification  upgrading  replacement and validation by third parties 
hie s year readiness program is an ongoing process involving continual evaluation and may be subject to change in response to new developments 
hie s products and services 
hie is in the process of assessing the year readiness of all products available currently or previously sold to customers and distributors 
hie expects this assessment to be complete in mid although hie does not generally warrant the year readiness of its products  it has disclosed to its customers and distributors that its products are year ready 
hie has defined year ready as the ability for a product component to initialize and operate normally on and after january   and  where applicable  the ability to correctly manipulate  display  store and exchange with other components of its system all dates  either prior  during  or after january  however  hie s products are configurable and programmable by end users  and year problems relating to re configurations and programming extensions to hie s base product generated by an end user cannot be anticipated by hie 
hie also markets its products and services as a solution for addressing the year problem 
as part of its year risk assessment services  hie executes an application that browses all cloverleaf site configuration files and provides a listing of the date fields that are at risk and where the fields are integrated within the cloverleaf system 
after executing its year risk assessment application  hie provides the customer with a written report describing the location of these at risk fields and the application interface that is affected 
hie attempts to limit by contract  both with its customers and with the parties that license technology to hie  its liability for damages arising in rendering its products and services 
despite this precaution  there can be no assurance that the limitations of liabilities set forth in its contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect hie from liability for damages 
in addition  hie s products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving sophisticated hardware and complex software products that hie cannot adequately evaluate for year problems 
hie may face claims based on year problems in other companies products  or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
internal it and non it systems 
hie is in the process of implementing new software for its accounting  internal network and timekeeping functions in order to consolidate various systems under its new strategic direction and integrate hublink s operations 
representations made by software vendors for these new systems  including year readiness  will be validated at the completion of that implementation  which is expected to be early non it systems  such as telecommunications systems  as well as existing it systems are currently being assessed 
other third parties 
hie has surveyed with a questionnaire material vendors and suppliers of systems used by hie for internal it and research and development in order to determine the extent to which hie is vulnerable to any failure by such material third parties to remediate their respective year problems and resolve such problems to the extent practicable 
hie expects the assessment to be complete in early and will take the necessary remediation action  including changing to vendors who are year compliant or installing internal it systems  to minimize the year non compliance risk with respect to third parties 
hie has not conducted a year survey of the distributors and financial institutions with whom it has material relationships 
year costs and contingency plans to date  hie has not incurred any material costs directly associated with its year readiness efforts nor accelerated the replacement of any system due to year issues 
hie does not anticipate that it will incur either significant operating expenses or significant capital expenditures to address year issues with respect to its internal systems and the software products and services that it markets 
in view of hie s year assessment and remediation efforts to date  and the limited activities that remain to be completed  hie s contingency plans consist of plans to re route phone calls  manual accounting and restoring working systems with backup files 
hie is in the final stages of development of these contingency plans  which are expected to be completed by mid risks of year issues in light of its compliance efforts  hie does not believe that the year issue will materially adversely affect operations or results of operations  and does not expect implementation to have a material impact on hie s consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that hie s systems will be year compliant prior to december   or that the failure of any such system will not have a material adverse effect on hie s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  to the extent the year problem has a material adverse effect on business  operations or financial condition of third parties with whom hie has material relationships  such as customers  distributors  vendors  suppliers and financial institutions  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on hie s business  results of operations and financial condition 
although hie has not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding involving its products or services related to year issues  hie may in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings or to negotiate resolutions of claims based on year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  regardless of the merits of such disputes  and any liability hie may have for year related damages  including consequential damages  could materially adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
there also can be no assurance that hie will be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage for such liabilities  that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms  or that such coverage will be available in amounts to cover one or more large claims 
the assertion of claims against hie that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in hie s insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on hie s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the above year discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting management s current assessment and estimates with respect to hie s year readiness efforts and the impact of year issues on hie s business  financial condition and results of operations 
various factors  many of which are beyond the control of hie  could cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those contemplated by such assessments  estimates and forward looking statements 
some of these factors include  but are not limited to  the accuracy of the year assurances  disclosures or representations by hie s customers  distributors  vendors  suppliers  financial institutions and other third parties with whom it has material relationships  availability of qualified personnel and other it resources and any actions of third parties with respect to year problems
