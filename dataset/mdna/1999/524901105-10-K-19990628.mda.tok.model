year processing issue the year issue affects the ability of computer systems to correctly process dates after december  the company has completed the inventory and assessment phases of its year project plan through an evaluation of its internal and third party software  as well as its service providers computer systems  to determine their ability to accurately process in the next millennium 
the company has also assessed the year status of its non information technology systems and equipment which may contain embedded hardware or software 
having identified and assessed those computer systems  processes and equipment that require modification  the company has substantially completed the remediation and testing phases of its project plan 
the company has completed the remediation and testing of its critical internal applications systems 
in addition to internal testing  the company actively participated in testing among securities brokerage firms  securities exchanges  clearing organizations  and other vendors 
in november  the company converted its securities brokerage processing system to a vendor that is the principal service provider of this type to the securities brokerage industry 
the vendor has confirmed to the company that it has substantially completed the necessary coding modifications and that its testing plan is on schedule with expected completion during the second quarter of the company has received similar confirmation for its proprietary mutual funds from the vendors that are the principal service providers to the mutual fund industry 
the company is also continuing to communicate with its remaining vendors and other third parties  including its landlords and utility suppliers  to determine the likely extent to which the company may be affected by third parties year plans and target dates 
the company expects its critical third party vendors to demonstrate or provide assurances of their year compliance by the end of the second quarter of the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
while the company does not have a current expectation of any material loss as a result of the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company s internal systems or the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be remediated on a timely basis  or that a failure to remediate by another party  or a remediation or conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has developed contingency plans in the event that third parties fail to achieve their year plans and target dates

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  year expenditures will be expensed as incurred 
the costs of the company s year project and the dates on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best current estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party compliance plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove correct and actual results could differ materially from those plans
