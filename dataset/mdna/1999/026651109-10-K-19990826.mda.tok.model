the lower than expected level of sales resulted in net income which  for the first time since the company became public  was substantially lower than net income in the comparable periods of the prior year 
the company attributes its lower than expected sales primarily to three factors a highly competitive retail environment  the lack of a full range of competitive retail financing programs and management and personnel challenges and inadequacies at the retail level caused by the company s substantial growth 
in response  management is now placing less emphasis on building or acquiring company owned retail sales centers and more on expanding the company s retail franchise network

management is committed to the goal of building long term shareholder value

inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has been modest and has primarily affected the company s manufacturing costs in the areas of labor  manufacturing overhead and raw materials other than lumber 
the price of lumber is affected more by the imbalances between supply and demand than by inflation 
historically  the company believes it has been able to minimize the effects of inflation by increasing the selling prices of its products  improving its manufacturing efficiency and increasing its employee productivity 
in addition  the company s business is seasonal  with weakest demand typically occurring during the company s third fiscal quarter december through february and the strongest demand typically occurring during the company s last fiscal quarter march through may 
over the history of the company s operations  management has not observed any correlation between interest rate fluctuations and increases or decreases in sales based solely on such fluctuations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
impact of year beginning in calendar year  the company commenced replacement of its then current information technology system with a new system 
the replacement  which is expected to be substantially completed in calendar year  is required to meet current and future needs of the company s business as well as to make various administrative and operating functions more efficient 
because the company did not undertake this replacement for reasons of year compliance  the costs of this conversion have not been identified as year compliance costs 
the costs of upgrading the company s software programs  operating hardware and network systems is estimated to be approximately million  with approximately million having been spent to date  and the company believes that these new programs and systems will not be subject to the year problem 
costs incurred to date for external consultants for year compliance specific costs are approximately  and management estimates an additional  will be required 
the company relies upon various vendors  utility companies  telecommunications service companies  delivery service companies and other service providers  which are outside of the company s control 
there is no assurance that such parties will not suffer a year business disruption  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company has implemented a detailed year project plan to assess the company s internal business critical systems upon which the company depends 
this includes information technology systems and applications it  as well as non it systems and equipment with embedded technology  such as fax machines and telephone systems 
the main internal it systems include accounting systems such as general ledgers 
detailed testing of the company s internal it systems is complete and some remedial work has also been completed 
the company completed its analysis of internal it systems by may  the end of its fiscal year and expects all corrective action and verification to be complete by september  any problems actually encountered by the company in addressing its year issue that are beyond the company s control could have adverse effects on the company s future operations  results of operations or financial condition 
the company is developing a year contingency plan to mitigate the effects of business disruption stemming from either internal system failures or an interruption in critical services or supplies from external sources over which the company has no control 
the plan is expected to be complete by september  the company believes that the worst case scenario relative to year issues would be a significant disruption of production due to wide spread failures of vendors and suppliers to provide critical materials and services  including utilities 
because of the broad geographical disbursement of the company s manufacturing facilities and the diversification of vendors for most materials  the company believes that such disruptions are unlikely 
where the company is dependent on a few suppliers to supply a crucial supply or component  measures have been taken  where possible  to identify alternative vendors who can supply the required materials 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its net variable rate debt  which consists of its liability for flooring of manufactured housing retail inventories  net of participations 
the company does not use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until the company would be required to refinance it 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
the company s financial instruments are not currently subject to foreign currency risk or commodity price risk 
the company does not believe that future market interest rate risks related to its marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on the company or the results of its future operations 
the company has no financial instruments held for trading purposes 
the company originates loans through its owned affiliate st century  most of which are at fixed rates of interest  in the ordinary course of business and periodically securitizes them to obtain permanent financing for such loan originations 
accordingly  st century s loans held for sale are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates between the time loans are originated and the time at which st century obtains permanent financing  generally at fixed rates of interest  in the asset backed securities market 
st century attempts to manage this risk by minimizing the warehousing period of unsecuritized loans 
loans held for investment  approximately  at may   also are subject to interest rate risk 
st century currently does not originate any loans with the intention of holding them for investment
