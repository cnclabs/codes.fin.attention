item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company s sales and operating revenues decreased in compared to a decrease in the decrease in sales and operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the average unit selling price of petroleum products 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in petroleum product sales volumes and an million or increase in merchandise sales 
the decrease in sales and operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the average unit selling price of petroleum products 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in petroleum product sales volumes and a million or increase in merchandise sales 
as previously mentioned  merchandise sales increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  while merchandise gross profit increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in merchandise gross margin merchandise gross profit as a percent of merchandise sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these aggregate increases are attributable to a slight increase in the number of operating units during the period and to the company s merchandise pricing program which has selectively increased margins on targeted merchandise yet still maintains an everyday low pricing policy which is competitive with major retail providers in the applicable market area 
as a result of the strategy  aggregate merchandise gross profit  on a same store basis  increased in as compared to same store average monthly merchandise sales increased approximately in as compared to gasoline sales accounted for of total revenues  while distillates and merchandise sales represented and  respectively 
this compares to a dollar mix from sales of gasoline  distillates and merchandise in  and gasoline  distillates and merchandise in the following table depicts the sales values of the principal classes of products sold by the company  which individually contributed more than ten percent of consolidated sales and operating revenues during the last three years sales of principal products millions of dollars gasoline no 
fuel diesel costs and operating expenses decreased in compared to a decrease in the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the price of crude oil 
the company utilizes the last in  first out lifo method to value inventory resulting in a better matching of current revenues and costs 
the impact of lifo was to decrease the company s costs and operating expenses by approximately million in while decreasing costs and operating expenses by million in additionally  there was a decrease in the average consumed cost per barrel of crude oil and feedstocks of 
these decreases were partially offset by slight increases in petroleum products sales volumes as mentioned above and a million cost increase resulting from valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market 
this million inventory reserve was precipitated by industry wide declines in the market prices of crude oil and refined products 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average consumed cost per barrel of crude oil and feedstocks of 
this decrease was partially offset by slight increases in petroleum products sales volumes 
the average consumed cost per barrel includes only those costs directly associated with the purchase and processing of crude oil and feedstocks 
accordingly  refinery operating expenses are not included in the average consumed cost per barrel of crude oil and feedstocks 
on october   the company executed a crude oil processing agreement processing agreement with statoil marketing and trading us inc  statoil whereby the company processes a monthly average of  barrels per day of crude oil owned and supplied by statoil at the company s pasadena  texas refinery 
the company receives a specified fee per barrel processed and returns to statoil a specified mix of finished petroleum products 
this processing agreement is scheduled to expire on october  as a result of this processing agreement  the company has decreased the level of crude oil and finished product inventories maintained and owned by the company  as well as  the level of accounts receivable owed to the company 
these decreases in working capital needs generate positive cash flows approximating million based upon the prices prevailing during the processing agreement 
the company utilizes the last in  first out lifo method to value its inventory 
the lifo method attempts to achieve a better matching of costs to revenues by including the most recent costs of products in costs and operating expenses 
the impact of the company s use of the lifo method was to increase the company s gross margin over what it would have been had the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation been utilized in and by 
per barrel million and 
per barrel million  respectively  while decreasing the company s gross margin by 
per barrel 
million 
the lifo impact is net of a 
million decrease in gross margin attributable to lower inventory levels and the resulting liquidation of lifo layers  which were carried at higher costs prevailing in prior years 
the lifo impact is net of a million increase in gross margin attributable to changes in the base year costs for a portion of the company s lifo inventories and reductions in inventory levels resulting in liquidations of lifo layers which were carried at lower costs from prior years 
there were no lifo layer liquidations in total yields of distillates decreased slightly to  barrels per day bpd in from  bpd in while total production of finished gasoline decreased slightly to  bpd in from  bpd in total yields of finished gasoline were increased slightly to  barrels per day bpd in from  bpd in while distillate production was increased slightly to  bpd in  from  bpd in total refinery production was  bpd in   bpd in and  bpd in selling expenses increased in after decreasing in the increase was primarily due to increases in store level operating expenses and marketing support costs attributable to the increase in the number of retail operating units and increases in labor rates  advertising and maintenance costs 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in store level operating expenses which include decreases related to environmental expenses and decreases in advertising and insurance related accruals 
at december   the company operated retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores compared to retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores at december  and retail gasoline facilities and convenience stores at december  administrative expenses increased in compared to administrative expenses in were comparable to the increase was primarily due to increases in expenses associated with the company wide business process reengineering project which includes a company wide computer system upgrade which will add year capability to the company s computer systems 
operating costs and expenses in   and include million  
million and 
million  respectively  of accrued litigation costs 
additionally  expenses include reductions of million related to favorable resolution of certain litigation and insurance claims 
also included in the expenses is million relating to the closure or sale of several marketing terminal locations and certain other corporate strategic initiatives 
included in operating costs and expenses in was million related to environmental matters 
operating costs and expenses in  and have been reduced by million  million and million  respectively  relating to adjustments in certain liability reserves 
depreciation and amortization increased in compared to depreciation and amortization in was comparable to the increases were primarily attributable to the amortization of refinery deferred turnaround expenses related to the turnarounds performed in the second and fourth quarters of and in the first quarter of additionally  there were increases in amortization of costs related to the systems development costs and the associated company wide computer upgrade projects 
interest and other income in was comparable to interest and other income increased 
million in the increase is due primarily to an increase in interest income of million due to an increase in the average daily cash invested of million which was partially offset by a loss of 
million from the equity in losses in affiliates 
interest expense in was comparable to which was comparable to liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents were million lower at year end than at year end the decrease was attributable to the net impact of cash provided by operating activities of million  cash inflows from financing activities of million  offset by million of net cash outflows from investment activities 
net cash inflows from operating activities in is due primarily to million in net inflows relating to other assets and liabilities 
these inflows were primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable and in crude oil and finished product inventories 
the decreases in crude oil and refined products inventories were due primarily to a decline in the market value of crude oil and refined petroleum products and to decreases in inventory levels as a result of the crude oil processing agreement with statoil marketing and trading us inc which decreases proprietary production levels thereby decreasing the need to maintain higher volumes of inventory 
additionally  there were increases in other accounts payable and in accrued excise tax liabilities 
partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows relating to decreases in crude oil and refined products payables 
cash outflows also include collateral deposits and deferred placement costs associated with the execution of a new financing arrangement 
the timing of collection of the company s receivables is impacted by the specific type of sale and associated terms 
bulk sales of finished products are typically sold in  barrel increments with three day payment terms 
rack sales at the company s product terminals are sold by truckload approximately  gallons with seven to ten day payment terms 
while the company s overall sales are aligned to its refining capability  receivables can vary between periods depending upon the specific type of sale and associated payment terms for sales near the end of a reporting period 
net cash inflows from financing activities in relates primarily to net cash borrowings from debt and credit agreements of million 
additionally  cash inflows include 
million from issuances of the company s class b common stock due to exercises of stock options and to net proceeds of 
million from the reduction of long term notes receivable 
net cash outflows from investment activities in consisted principally of capital expenditures of million which includes million related to the marketing area  million for refinery operations and million related to corporate strategic projects and million of refinery deferred turnaround costs 
additionally  cash outflows from investing activities include million in capitalized costs of software developed for the company s own use and million in charges to deferred assets 
the total outflows from investment activities were partially offset by million in dividends received from the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries and net proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of 
million 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was and  respectively  at december  and if fifo values had been used for all inventories  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities would have been at december  and at december  like other petroleum refiners and marketers  the company s operations are subject to extensive and rapidly changing federal and state environmental regulations governing air emissions  waste water discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
the company s policy is to accrue environmental and clean up related costs of a non capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often extremely difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  the company anticipates that a significant capital investments will continue to be required over the next several years to comply with existing regulations 
the company believes that cash provided from its operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund these costs 
the company had recorded a liability of approximately million as of december  to cover the estimated costs of compliance with environmental regulations which are not anticipated to be of a capital nature 
the liability of million includes accruals for issues extending past environmental liabilities are subject to considerable uncertainties which affect the company s ability to estimate its ultimate cost of remediation efforts 
these uncertainties include the exact nature and extent of the contamination at each site  the extent of required clean up efforts  varying costs of alternative remediation strategies  changes in environmental remediation requirements  the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the identification of new environmental sites 
as a result  charges to income for environmental liabilities could have a material effect on results of operations in a particular quarter or year as assessments and remediation efforts proceed or as new claims arise 
however  management is not aware of any matters which would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
during  the company estimates environmental expenditures at the pasadena and tyler refineries  of at least million and million  respectively 
of these expenditures  it is anticipated that million for pasadena and million for tyler will be of a capital nature  while million and 
million  respectively  will be related to previously accrued non capital remediation efforts 
at the company s marketing facilities  environmental expenditures relating to previously accrued non capital compliance efforts are planned totaling approximately million during as a result of overall favorable credit relationships  the company has been able to maintain open lines of credit with its major suppliers 
effective as of december   the company entered into an million loan and security agreement secured credit facility for cash borrowing and letter of credit needs 
the secured credit facility  which has a three year term and is secured by certain current assets of the company  is intended for general corporate and working capital requirements 
it includes limitations on additional indebtedness and cash dividends and requires compliance with financial covenants dealing with minimum levels of working capital and net worth 
availability under the secured credit facility is limited to the lesser of million or eligible collateral 
at december   the borrowing capacity totaled million due to abnormally low inventory levels and prices 
the company expects that with average inventory operating levels and crude oil in the per barrel range  the availability under the secured credit facility will range from million to million 
as of december   under the terms of the secured credit facility  the company had cash borrowings of million and outstanding irrevocable letters of credit in the principal amount of million  which was collateralized by cash 
this collateral is included on the balance sheet as restricted cash and was returned to the company in early january the cash borrowings were repaid in january the unused availability under the terms of the secured credit facility was million at year end 
the company pays an annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit line 
in march  the company amended the secured credit facility to provide up to million availability for cash borrowing and letter of credit needs 
up to million of the secured credit facility continues to be subject to availability of eligible collateral as discussed above 
the increased availability is not subject to the limitation of eligible collateral as that term is defined in the secured credit facility 
at the company s option  the unsecured senior notes notes may be redeemed at of the principal amount at any time after january  and thereafter at an annually declining premium over par until february  when they are redeemable at par 
the notes were issued under an indenture which includes certain restrictions and limitations customary with senior indebtedness of this type including  but not limited to  the payment of dividends and the repurchase of capital stock 
there are no sinking fund requirements on the notes 
the purchase money liens outstanding as of december   primarily include the financing of land  buildings and equipment at certain service station and convenience store locations 
these borrowings are generally repayable over to months with an effective interest rate based upon a fixed spread over the then current applicable us treasury note rate 
purchase money liens are secured by assets having a cost basis of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the cost basis of assets securing purchase money liens was reduced by million in january due to the repayment of one of the instruments 
the remaining principal balance is payable monthly through may the company s management is involved in a continual process of evaluating growth opportunities in its core business as well as its capital resource alternatives 
total capital expenditures and deferred turnaround costs in are projected to approximate million 
the capital expenditures relate primarily to planned enhancements at the company s refineries  retail unit improvements and to company wide environmental requirements 
the company believes  but there can be no assurance  that cash provided from its operating activities  together with other available sources of liquidity  including the secured credit facility  will be sufficient over the next several years to make required payments of principal and interest on its debt  permit anticipated capital expenditures and fund the company s working capital requirements 
the secured credit facility expires on december  but may be extended for additional one year periods upon agreement between the company and the agent 
any major acquisition would likely require a combination of additional debt and equity 
the company places its temporary cash investments in high credit quality financial instruments which are in accordance with the covenants of the company s financing agreements 
these securities mature within ninety days and  therefore  bear minimal risk 
the company has not experienced any losses on these investments 
the company faces intense competition in all of the business areas in which it operates 
many of the company s competitors are substantially larger and  therefore  the company s earnings can be affected by the marketing and pricing policies of its competitors  as well as changes in raw material costs 
merchandise sales and operating revenues from the company s convenience stores are seasonal in nature  generally producing higher sales and net income in the summer months than at other times of the year 
gasoline sales  both at the crown multi pumps and convenience stores  are also somewhat seasonal in nature and  therefore  related revenues may vary during the year 
the seasonality does not  however  negatively impact the company s overall ability to sell its refined products 
the company maintains business interruption insurance to protect itself against losses resulting from shutdowns to refinery operations from fire  explosions and certain other insured casualties 
business interruption coverage begins for such losses in excess of million 
the company has disclosed in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements on page of this report  various contingencies which involve litigation and environmental liabilities 
depending on the occurrence  amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these contingencies  the outcome of which cannot reasonably be determined at this time  it is possible that the company s future results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected in a particular quarter or year 
however  the company has concluded  after consultation with counsel  that there is no reasonable basis to believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these contingencies will have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  as discussed in item legal proceedings on page of this report  the company s collective bargaining agreement at its pasadena refinery expired on february  on february   the company invoked a lock out of employees in the collective bargaining unit 
the company has been operating the pasadena refinery without interruption since the lock out and intends to continue full operations in this manner  until an agreement is reached with the collective bargaining unit 
effects of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the dollar s purchasing power 
in the capital intensive industry in which the company operates  the replacement costs for its properties would generally far exceed their historical costs 
as a result  depreciation would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  since the replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive and versatile than existing facilities  thereby increasing profits and mitigating increased depreciation and operating costs 
in recent years  crude oil and refined petroleum product prices have been volatile which has impacted working capital requirements 
if the prices increase in the future  the company would expect a related increase in working capital needs 
additional factors that may affect future results the company s operating results have been  and will continue to be  affected by a wide variety of factors that could have an adverse effect on profitability during any particular period  many of which are beyond the company s control 
among these are the supply and demand for crude oil and refined products  which is largely driven by the condition of local and worldwide economies and politics  although seasonality and weather patterns also play a significant part 
governmental regulations and policies  particularly in the areas of energy and the environment  also have a significant impact on the company s activities 
operating results can be affected by these industry factors  by competition in the particular geographic markets that the company serves and by company specific factors  such as the success of particular marketing programs and refinery operations 
in addition  the company s profitability depends largely on the difference between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil prices 
this margin is continually changing and may significantly fluctuate from time to time 
crude oil and refined products are commodities whose price levels are largely determined by market forces beyond the control of the company 
additionally  due to the seasonality of refined products and refinery maintenance schedules  results of operations for any particular quarter of a fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year 
in general  prices for refined products are significantly influenced by the price of crude oil 
although an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil generally results in a corresponding increase or decrease in prices for refined products  often there is a lag time in the realization of the corresponding increase or decrease in prices for refined products 
the effect of changes in crude oil prices on operating results therefore depends in part on how quickly refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes 
a substantial or prolonged increase in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in refined product prices  a substantial or prolonged decrease in refined product prices without a corresponding decrease in crude oil prices  or a substantial or prolonged decrease in demand for refined products could have a significant negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company is dependent on refining and selling quantities of refined products at margins sufficient to cover operating costs  including any future inflationary pressures 
the refining business is characterized by high fixed costs resulting from the significant capital outlays associated with refineries  terminals and related facilities 
furthermore  future regulatory requirements or competitive pressures could result in additional capital expenditures  which may or may not produce desired results 
such capital expenditures may require significant financial resources that may be contingent on the company s continued access to capital markets and commercial bank financing on favorable terms 
purchases of crude oil supply are typically made pursuant to relatively short term  renewable contracts with numerous foreign and domestic major and independent oil producers  generally containing market responsive pricing provisions 
futures  forwards and exchange traded options are used to minimize the exposure of the company s refining margins to crude oil and refined product fluctuations 
the company also selectively uses the futures market to help manage the price risk inherent in purchasing crude oil in advance of the delivery date  and in maintaining the value of inventories contained within its refinery and pipeline system 
hedging strategies used to minimize this exposure include fixing a future margin between crude and certain finished products and also hedging fixed price purchase and sales commitments of crude oil and refined products 
while the company s hedging activities are intended to reduce volatility while providing an acceptable profit margin on a portion of production  the use of such a program can effect the company s ability to participate in an improvement in related product profit margins 
although the company s net sales and operating revenues fluctuate significantly with movements in industry crude oil prices  such prices do not have a direct relationship to net earnings  which are subject to the impact of the company s lifo method of accounting discussed below 
the effect of changes in crude oil prices on the company s operating results is determined more by the rate at which the prices of refined products adjust to reflect such changes 
the following table estimates the sensitivity of the company s income before taxes to price changes which impact its refining and retail margins based on a representative production rate for the refineries net of the statoil contract which provides a fixed margin and a representative amount of total gasoline sold at the company s retail units earnings sensitivity change annual impact refining margin bbl million retail margin gal million based on december  crude oil and refined products market prices market prices  the company s outstanding derivative commodity instruments held at december  are anticipated to result in an increase in future earnings of approximately million 
if market prices were to increase by  the anticipated increase in future earnings would approximate million 
similarly  if market prices were to decrease by  the anticipated decrease in futures earnings would approximate 
million 
the company conducts environmental assessments and remediation efforts at multiple locations  including operating facilities and previously owned or operated facilities 
the company accrues environmental and clean up related costs of a non capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
estimated costs  which are based upon experience and assessments  are recorded at undiscounted amounts without considering the impact of inflation  and are adjusted periodically as additional or new information is available 
expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized 
the company s crude oil  refined products and convenience store merchandise and gasoline inventories are valued at the lower of cost based on the last in  first out or lifo method of accounting or market  with the exception of crude oil inventory held for resale which is valued at the lower of cost based on the first in first out or fifo method of accounting or market 
under the lifo method  the effects of price increases and decreases in crude oil and other feedstocks are charged directly to the cost of refined products sold in the period that such price changes occur 
in periods of rising prices  the lifo method may cause reported operating income to be lower than would otherwise result from the use of the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling prices the lifo method may cause reported operating income to be higher than would otherwise result from the use of the fifo method 
impact of year the company uses software and related information technologies and other equipment throughout its businesses that may be affected by the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define a particular year 
these computer programs include both information technology it systems such as software programs and non information technology non it systems such as embedded microcontrollers in electronic equipment 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  manufacture products  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company initially commenced its year readiness program in early the company began a long term project which encompassed an in depth evaluation of all current business processes and the redesign of any of these processes where significant opportunity for improvement was identified 
one of the results of this project was the decision to purchase and implement an enterprise wide state of the art fully integrated software package sap r tm which was selected in connection with re designing business practices to further enhance operating and record keeping efficiencies 
this software is year compliant 
due to the enterprise wide scale of the project  the majority of the company s year issues should be resolved as an added benefit of this software implementation 
the following paragraphs address those computer systems that are not encompassed within the sap r tm system 
the evaluation of the company s state of readiness relating to its year issues is a continual process emphasizing a constant awareness of computer systems and business relationships that may be sensitive to year issues 
management has categorized the activities necessary to solve the year issues into the identification and assessment phase  the remediation phase  and the testing and contingency planning phase 
the identification and assessment phase includes conducting a comprehensive inventory and evaluation of all of the company s information technology it systems and non it electronic equipment collectively referred to as computer programs to identify those computer programs that contain date sensitive features 
those computer programs that contain such features are then further evaluated and categorized as either mission critical or non mission critical based upon their relative importance to the uninterrupted continuation of the company s daily operations 
mission critical computer programs gain top priority when allocating the available resources to solve year issues 
as of january   with the exception of the non it electronic equipment at the company s two refineries  the company had completed the identification and assessment of all of its information technology it systems and non it electronic equipment  both mission critical and non mission critical 
a consulting group was engaged to assist with the identification and assessment of the non it electronic equipment at the pasadena refinery  and similar efforts were undertaken by company employees at the tyler refinery 
as of march   substantially all of the assessment work at the pasadena refinery has been completed  while the tyler refinery assessment is complete 
the company expects to complete the remaining assessment activities at the tyler refinery early in the second quarter of the assessment phase also includes the identification of and communication with hardware and software vendors with whom the company transacts business  third parties with whom the company exchanges information electronically  major or sole source suppliers  government agencies  and major customers 
the focus of these communications is to determine the state of readiness of each of these third parties with respect to their own year issues and how their progress may impact the company 
the majority of responses received to third party inquiries indicate that they are working on their year issues  but the responses do not provide specific details 
follow up action related to material third party inquiries and responses is expected to continue in as these material third parties progress in their own year readiness projects 
the company has no means of ensuring that third parties with whom it deals will be year compliant or that the information obtained from such third parties regarding year compliance will prove to be accurate 
the remediation phase includes the repair  upgrade or replacement of all computer programs identified as non compliant in the assessment phase 
these activities will include all computer programs that have not been scheduled to be repaired  upgraded or replaced as well as those that had been scheduled but whose timing of repair  upgrading or replacement was accelerated to resolve the company s year issues 
the company s primary strategy for correcting year issues is to replace all non compliant technology with newly purchased technology that  in addition to being year compliant  provides enhanced business functionality and capabilities 
this phase has been on going since and is expected to be substantially completed by september  the total cost associated with required modifications and replacement of the company s systems in response to the year issue is not expected to materially affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the estimated total cost of the year effort is approximately million 
this estimate does not include costs to replace or upgrade systems that were previously planned and not accelerated due to the year issue 
the total amount expended through march  was approximately 
million 
the future cost is estimated to be approximately million 
the company s year efforts are funded primarily from existing it and business unit budgets 
the testing and contingency planning phase includes testing the computer programs worked on in the remediation phase for accuracy as well as concurrently developing contingency plans that may be put into effect in the event that significant deficiencies are identified 
contingency planning also encompasses developing alternative sources of supply in the event of failure by material third parties to remedy their own year issues 
testing of computer programs is expected to be completed as remediation or replacement of individual programs is completed 
due to the number of computer programs utilized by the company and the need to begin remediation  replacement  and testing of mission critical programs in a timely manner  any or all of the phases identified may be performed concurrently 
testing of implemented technologies will be a continual process with the expectation that all of the company s mission critical systems will be tested by the end of the third quarter of contingency plans will be formulated as the need arises 
while the company s management anticipates that all mission critical computer programs will be assessed  remedied and tested by the dates set forth in the preceding paragraphs  there can be no assurance that all will be completely error free and that such programs will be compliant by such dates 
we rely on third party software  equipment and services to conduct our business 
while the company believes it has made reasonable efforts to address this issue  it has no means of ensuring that third parties with whom it deals will be year compliant or that the information obtained from such third parties regarding year compliance will prove to be accurate 
the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios would be failure of the control systems at the company s refineries  or the failure of key customers or suppliers eg utility providers to achieve year compliance 
either of these scenarios could result in lost sales or lost production due to the forced shutdown for an indefinite period at one or both refineries 
in order to mitigate the affect of any such disruption  the company may increase inventory levels prior to year end based on assessments made closer to the end of in the event that only one refinery is affected by year failures  the company has the flexibility of shifting feedstocks between facilities  or procuring petroleum products via sale  trade or exchange agreements in order to meet any contractual requirements 
the failure to correct a material year problem or the inability of any key customer  key supplier or a governmental agency to make the necessary computer system changes on a timely basis  the inaccuracy of responses received from these third parties  and the potential shortage of skilled human resources to install and test upgraded software and equipment could result in interruptions to company operations or business activities 
such interruptions could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  particularly as it relates to the readiness of the company s key customers and suppliers  and of governmental agencies  the company cannot ascertain at this time whether the consequences of the year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
insurance coverage available at this time is limited to business interruption resulting from fire  explosion  or related perils which are caused by a year system failure 
the foregoing year discussion constitutes a forward looking statement within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
it is based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections  which could ultimately prove to be inaccurate
