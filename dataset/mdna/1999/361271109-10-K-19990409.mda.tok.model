results of operations comparison of the year ended december  versus the year ended december total revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million in rents  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues increased an aggregate million  or  from a combined total of million for the year ended december   to million in three million of the aggregate increase in rents  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues was related to the acquisition of million in rental properties and the remaining interest in six new jersey mobs since june  the acquisition of five mobs located in valencia  california in march accounted for an additional million of this increase and the purchase of two senior care facilities located in santa monica  california and hoquiam  washington during resulted in the remaining million increase 
interest  loan fees and related revenues derived from loans secured by senior care facilities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to interest and loan fee income increased million due to interest and loan fees related to five loans that were originated in late or early and increased million due to interest earned on excess cash from the november preferred stock offering and the april debt refinancing 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million related to a gain from the sale of bonds on march  and a decrease of million related to the repayment of million of notes receivable during total expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million in the primary reason for this increase was a million increase in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  notes and bonds receivable as of december  see liquidity and capital resources 
excluding this increase in the company s allowance during the year ended december   operating expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in property operating expenses decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million in  despite a million increase in operating costs related to the five mobs acquired in march this reduction is part of management s ongoing efforts to reduce property operating costs and includes a million reduction of property taxes as a result of the company s successful efforts in appealing the assessed value of its mob properties 
furthermore  the million in mob properties and senior care properties acquired between june and december  and the two senior care properties acquired during were leased on a triple net basis  thus the company incurred no operating costs related to these buildings 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in of this increase  million was attributable to property acquisitions made by the company since june  the remaining million increase consisted of depreciation on building and tenant improvements  non real estate assets and the amortization of leasing commissions 
interest expense decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million in this decrease in interest expense was attributable to the reduction of million of the company s notes payable and million of borrowings on a line of credit which were paid down with the net proceeds of million from the two preferred stock offerings in resulting in a million decrease in interest expense 
interest expense also decreased due to the write off of million in loan costs in associated with these notes payable and the capitalization of million of interest related to development projects in this decrease was offset by interest incurred of million on million of new borrowings in general and administrative expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million in this increase is related to the company s addition of acquisition  development and support personnel 
net income decreased million  or  from million for the twelve months ended december  to million in this decrease is primarily due to an increase in the company s reserves of million and a decrease in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of million offset by a million increase in rental revenues  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues 
comparison of the year ended december  versus the year ended december revenues increased approximately or million from million for the year ended december  to million in this increase in revenues was the result of a million  or  increase in rents  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues which was partially offset by a million  or  decline in interest  loan fees and related revenues 
the million increase in rents  tenant reimbursements and parking revenues resulted from several events  including the addition  on february   of the six newly acquired new jersey properties  the commencement on may  of the tustin hospital lease  the leasing  in august  of the maryland gardens facility to a nursing home operator  the acquisition of the hampden properties and a full year of revenues in from the reacquired property located at north bedford drive 
during  the company made new investments in short term secured loans through gln  an unconsolidated affiliate 
interest  loan fees and related revenues declined million from million during to million in  reflecting management s decision to make investments in secured trust deeds through gln for which the company reports its pro rata share of net income from gln but no revenues 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated affiliates  such as gln  using the equity method  therefore  the company s pro rata share of net income from investment in such unconsolidated affiliates is reported after income from operations 
the company s pro rata share of net income from gln totaled million for excluding the loss on disposition of rental property of million  operating expenses increased million  or  from million during to million in property operations increased million  or  from million in to million in the newly acquired properties in new jersey and the hampden properties are leased on a net basis and therefore are not anticipated to add significant operating expense 
the increased operating costs are the result of the acquisition of the tustin hospital and adjacent mobs in june and the reacquisition of the north bedford drive property in august the company also increased earthquake insurance coverage on its properties located in southern california which has partially contributed to the rise in property operations expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased or million  from million in to million in this increase in depreciation and amortization expense is the result of depreciation expense related to the six new jersey properties  the tustin hospital and adjacent mobs  the maryland gardens facility  the hampden properties nursing homes and north bedford drive 
interest expense  which includes amortization of deferred financing costs  declined million from million in to million in the decrease in interest expense resulted from the reduction of long term debt retired with the proceeds from the sale of series a and series b preferred stock in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the new loans obtained in conjunction with the new jersey and massachusetts acquisitions offset the reduction in debts and interest expense from the preferred stock offerings 
the company s general and administrative expense increased  or million  in compared to this increase is related to the company s addition of acquisition and support personnel 
in  general and administrative expense was million representing a cost of of total assets of million at december  although general and administrative expense increased in in absolute terms  in relative terms it declined to of total assets of million at december  net income declined million from million for the year ended december  to million in primarily due to non recurring gains and losses resulting from the disposition of one of the company s properties in the primary components affecting this decline were the million extraordinary gain on retirement of secured debt which was partially offset by a million loss on disposition of the related rental property

financing policies the company s ratio of debt to total market capitalization is and based upon the closing price of the common stock at december  and march   respectively 
total market capitalization is based on the long term debt of the operating partnership  plus i the aggregate market value of the company s common stock and operating partnership units not owned by the company assuming one unit is equivalent in value to one share of common stock  and ii the aggregate liquidation value of the series a preferred stock and the series b preferred stock 
to the extent that the board of directors of the company decides to seek additional funding  the company may raise such capital using various means  including retention of internally generated funds subject to the distribution requirements in the code with respect to reits  existing working capital and possibly the issuance of additional debt secured or unsecured or equity securities or any combination of the above 
if the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital to fund investments by the operating partnership  the company will contribute such funds to the operating partnership as a contribution to capital and will purchase additional interests in the operating partnership 
it is anticipated that borrowings will continue to be made through the operating partnership or other entities  although the company may also incur indebtedness that may be re borrowed by the operating partnership on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to the company s borrowing of such funds 
except as required pursuant to existing financing agreements  the company has not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages or unsecured debt that may be placed on any single property or on its portfolio as a whole 
the board of directors of the company also has the authority to cause the operating partnership to issue additional units in any manner and subject to certain limitations in the partnership agreement on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate and may also decide to seek financing for the purposes of managing the company s balance sheet by adjusting the company s existing capitalization 
the refinancing of the company s balance sheet may entail the issuance and or retirement of debt  equity or hybrid securities 
inflation the majority of the company s leases are long term leases designed to mitigate the adverse effect of inflation 
approximately of the company s leases contain provisions that call for annual rent increases equal to the increase in the consumer price index and the majority of the remaining leases allow for specific annual rent increases 
furthermore  many of the company s leases require tenants to pay a pro rata share of building operating expenses  including real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance 
the effect of such provisions is to reduce the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities depending on the rights or obligations under the contract 
sfas also establishes new accounting methodologies for the following three classifications of hedges fair value  cash flow and net investment in foreign operations 
management believes the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
year compliance the information provided below contains year statements and is a year readiness disclosure pursuant to pub

no 
many computers  software programs and other equipment which utilize microprocessors collectively referred to as systems and individually as a system process date sensitive data in the normal course of operations 
some of these systems use a digit field to designate the year 
as the year approaches  these systems may not be capable of distinguishing between events occurring in the year and the year  and therefore these systems may become inoperable or produce information that is unreliable 
information technology systems the company s critical information technology systems consist of its windows nt operating systems and related windows software as well as its accounting  property management and fixed assets software 
the company relies on third party vendors for its computer hardware and software 
based upon management s communications with the company s systems vendors and an outside consultant  management believes that the company s hardware and software systems are  or will be  year compliant by december  and that the company s internal computer hardware and software systems will not be materially impacted by this issue 
currently  the company s accounting and property management software has not yet been deemed year compliant 
however  the company plans to upgrade to the next version of this software  which is year compliant  during the first six months of the company has obtained the updated version and will install it in the cost of this upgrade is not expected to be material to the company 
non information technology systems the company s critical non information technology building systems consist of utilities  security  and elevators 
the company has not yet determined whether all of these systems are year compliant 
the company relies on third party vendors to service most of these systems and is currently in communication with these vendors to determine if these building systems are or will be year compliant by december  the company s property managers have contacted the company s vendors and made inquiries about the year readiness of these systems 
approximately of the company s vendors have confirmed in writing that these systems are year compliant 
the company has also received confirmation in writing from certain vendors that their systems will be year compliant by december  the company is still following up with those vendors who have only verbally confirmed year compliance or who have not responded to the company s inquiries 
in january  the company made inquiries of all of its tenants concerning their year compliance and what impact non compliance would have on the company 
through march   the company had received approximately responses representing of its tenants 
none of these responses indicated that the company would suffer any negative impact due to year non compliance 
risks while the company does not expect year issues related to the company s internal systems to have a serious impact on the company s operations  the company receives most of its revenues in the form of rental payments 
if any of the company s tenants suffer a severe disruption of their business due to a year problem  it could affect the ability of those tenants to pay their rent 
if multiple tenants were to suffer a severe disruption of their business  the company can provide no assurance that its operations would not be materially affected 
costs the cost to the company to make its internal systems year compliant is not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position 
however  management is not able to adequately assess the extent to which the company is vulnerable to system failures of any of its tenants or other companies providing utilities or other services to its properties 
management plans to continue conversations with other companies with which the company does significant business to minimize  to the extent possible  the potential impact of year compliance failures 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario because the company is unable at this time to identify such a scenario 
the company will continue to evaluate these and other potential areas of risk and develop contingency plans  as appropriate 
funds from operations industry analysts generally consider ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of a reit 
the company s financial statements use the concept of ffo as defined by the board of governors of nareit 
ffo is calculated to include the minority interests share of income since the operating partnership s net income is allocated proportionately among all owners of operating partnership units 
the number of operating partnership units held by the company is identical to the number of outstanding shares of the company s common stock  and owners of operating partnership units may  at their discretion  convert their units into shares of common stock on a one for one basis 
the company believes that  in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the operating results of the company  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the company s net income as presented in the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k and the additional data presented below 
the table on the following page presents an analysis of ffo and additional data for each of the four quarters and the year ended december  for the operating partnership g l realty corp 
funds from operations for the four quarters and year ended december  fiscal quarter year st nd rd th in thousands  except per share data funds from operations net income      minority interest in operating partnership operating partnership income loss      depreciation of real estate assets    amortization of deferred lease costs depreciation of real estate assets from unconsolidated affiliates adjustment for minority interest in consolidated affiliates dividends paid on preferred stock      operating partnership funds from operations     minority interest in operating partnership funds from operations     dividends declared dividends paid on common stock      pay out ratio n a weighted average shares unit outstanding basic      fully diluted      additional data cash flows operating activities      investing activities      financing activities     capital expenditures building improvements tenant improvements furniture  fixtures equipment leasing commissions depreciation and amortization depreciation of real estate assets    depreciation of non real estate assets amortization of deferred lease costs amortization of capitalized financing costs rents straight line rent      billed rent      ffo represents net income computed in accordance with gaap  consistently applied  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real property  less preferred stock dividends paid to holders of preferred stock during the period and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated entities in which the company holds a partial interest 
ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by nareit 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator developed in compliance with gaap  including measures of liquidity such as cash flows from operations  investing and financing activities 
ffo is helpful in evaluating the performance of a real estate portfolio considering the fact that historical cost accounting assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
ffo is only one of a range of indicators which should be considered in determining a company s operating performance 
the methods of calculating ffo among different companies are subject to variation  and ffo therefore may be an invalid measure for purposes of comparing companies 
also  the elimination of depreciation and gains and losses on sales of property may not be a true indication of an entity s ability to recover its investment in properties 
the company implemented the new method of calculating ffo effective as of the nareit suggested adoption date of january  ffo has been restated for all prior periods under the new method 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary risk inherent in the company s market sensitive instruments is the risk of loss resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
approximately of the company s notes payable bear interest at a rate indexed to the one month libor rate 
the table below provides information as of december  about the company s long term debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rate and estimated fair value 
the weighted average interest rates presented are the actual rates as of december  fair market principal maturing in value december  thereafter total in thousands liabilities mortgage debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate line of credit variable rate    average interest rate the company s future earnings and cash flows relating to market sensitive instruments are primarily dependent upon prevailing libor market interest rate 
based upon interest rates as of december   a increase in the libor rate would decrease future earnings and cash flow by  a decrease in the libor rate would increase future earnings and cash flow by  a change in the libor rate would not have a material impact on the fair value of the company s debt
