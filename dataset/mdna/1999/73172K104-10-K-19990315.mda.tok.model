overview polycom was incorporated in december to develop  manufacture and market conferencing products that facilitate meetings at a distance 
polycom was engaged principally in research and development from inception through september  when it began volume shipments of its first audioconferencing product  soundstation 
as of december   polycom s audioconferencing product line consisted principally of the soundstation  soundstation ex  soundstation premier  soundstation premier ex  soundpoint and soundpoint pro 
polycom began shipping its first dataconferencing product  showstation  in november in march  polycom began shipments of its next generation showstation  the showstation ip 
as of december   polycom s dataconferencing product line consisted principally of the showstation ip and webstation 
on january   the company completed the acquisition of viavideo communications  inc  viavideo  a development stage company that designed and developed high quality  low cost  easy to use  group videoconferencing systems that utilize advanced video and audio compression technologies along with internet web based features 
in february  polycom began customer shipments of the viewstation  its first videoconferencing product 
as of december   polycom s videoconferencing product line consisted principally of the viewstation  viewstation  viewstation v 
and viewstation mp 
in september  the company began shipping its meetingsite product  a multipoint conferencing unit mcu product  which provides connectability for large multipoint videoconference calls 
polycom markets its products domestically and internationally through a network of value added resellers vars  original equipment manufacturers oems  and retailers 
the company also sells its audioconferencing products through its direct sales force 
effective january  the direct sales force also began selling the dataconferencing product line 
through december   polycom has derived a majority of its net revenues from sales of its soundstation and viewstation products 
polycom anticipates that sales of the soundstation and viewstation product lines will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net revenues at least through the year ending december  any factor adversely affecting the demand or supply for these products would materially adversely affect polycom s business  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
from inception through the nine month period ended september   the company incurred losses from operations  primarily as a result of its investments in the development of its products and the expansion of its sales and marketing  manufacturing and administrative organizations 
the company achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of and generated net income in fiscal the company incurred a quarterly operating loss in each quarter of as a result of investments in the next generation dataconferencing product  the videoconferencing product line and the sales and marketing function 
the company intends to continue to invest significantly in research and development  sales and marketing and the company s infrastructure in although polycom plans to generate operating income through  there is a limited history of profitability for the company 
additionally  because polycom s profitability is very dependent on the market acceptance and profitability of a relatively small amount of products  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its operating plans or achieve profitable operations in any subsequent period 
in march  polycom entered into a joint marketing and development agreement the first agreement with m 
under the agreement  m provided million in funding to polycom for certain deliverables related to the development of the showstation ip and may also provide shared technology resources for the development of future products 
polycom recorded the million as revenue  million in each of the first three quarters of  based on delivery of the items specified in this contract 
the amounts were recognized as revenue using the percentage of completion methodology 
additionally  polycom granted m exclusive private label rights and distribution rights in certain distribution channels to the products developed under this agreement  subject to certain minimum volumes 
effective january  however  m no longer has exclusive distribution rights 
further  m received warrants to purchase up to  shares of polycom s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in march  m exercised the warrants and purchased  shares of polycom s common stock 
at the time of grant  the warrants were valued using the black scholes model and were determined to have a value of  m was also granted certain rights of first offer under its stock warrant agreement with polycom which gave m the right to purchase additional shares of polycom common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in february  m exercised this option and purchased approximately one million shares of polycom common stock for a consideration of approximately million 
with the exercise of the warrants  this right of first offer expired 
as of march   m owned approximately of the outstanding polycom common stock 
in june  the company entered into a second joint marketing and development agreement the second agreement with m 
under this agreement  m provided million in funding to polycom for certain deliverables related to the development of videoconferencing products and may also provide shared technology resources for the development of future products 
polycom granted m exclusive private label rights and distribution rights in certain distribution channels to the products developed under this agreement subject to certain minimum volumes 
in the three months ended march  and the three months ended june   the company received  and recognized as revenue  million and million  respectively  under this agreement  using the percentage of completion methodology 
on july   the company announced that robert c 
hagerty  previously polycom s president and coo  was appointed the role of president and ceo 
brian l 
hinman  formerly chairman and ceo  continues as chairman of the board of directors 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net litigation settlement income  net other expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues total net revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase was due in large part to revenues from the videoconferencing products which were not part of the prior year revenue stream 
additionally  audioconferencing product line sales volume increases  primarily in north america  also contributed to the revenue growth 
further  in the company recorded million in revenue relating to the second agreement with m 
this m revenue compares with the million in revenue associated with the first agreement with m 
total net revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase was due to unit volume increases of the soundstation over the same period in  the introduction of the new premier and soundpoint product lines in and revenue in associated with the first agreement with m 
these increases were partially offset by price reductions for the soundstation product line and showstation unit volume decreases 
during  and  polycom derived a substantial majority of its net revenues from sales of its soundstation and viewstation product families 
one customer accounted for and of net revenues in and  respectively 
no other customer or reseller accounted for more than of polycom s net revenues during the periods 
international net revenues accounted for   and of total net revenues for   and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for business segment information 
in  volume increases in all international regions  primarily europe  contributed to the increase in the percentage of international revenue 
in  price reductions and the million in domestic revenue associated with the first m agreement offset unit growth in the company s international business 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net revenues for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
additionally  international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future as the company introduces new products  since the company expects to initially introduce such products in north america and also because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
also  the ongoing economic problems in the asian and latin american markets could adversely affect the company s profitability if such economic problems continue 
further  the company plans to expand operations in the europe  middle east and africa region in this expansion of marketing and administrative functions could initially divert management s attention from the sales effort which could materially adversely affect revenue growth in this region 
to the extent the company is unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products 
to date  a substantial majority of the company s international sales has been denominated in us currency  however  the company expects that in the future more international sales may be denominated in local currencies and  therefore  subject to currency fluctuation risks 
further  beginning january   the participating member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the european currency unit the euro as the common legal currency 
on that same date they established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
this establishment of the euro should not have any significant impact on polycom since a substantial majority of the company s international sales has been denominated in us currency 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs including material and direct labor  polycom s manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense and an allocation of overhead expenses 
the cost of net revenues represented of net revenues in compared to in this improvement in cost over is attributable to a more favorable product mix  royalty revenues with no associated costs  favorable material price improvements and favorable manufacturing variances related to increased production levels 
when comparing to  the cost of net revenues represented of net revenues in versus in the increase in cost of net revenues percentage is primarily attributable to the soundstation price reduction implemented in north america in january and the soundstation price reduction implemented in the international regions in april also  the costs associated with transitioning the soundstation and premier product manufacturing to celestica  formerly ims  in thailand and the introduction of a lower margin audio product contributed to the higher cost of net revenues percentage 
these increases were offset by the revenue received under the first agreement with m  which had very low associated costs 
forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult 
polycom expects that the overall cost of net revenues percentage will remain at current levels in  however  there can be no assurances that this will happen 
for example  uncertainties surrounding competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  the royalty revenue stream  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs  and timing of sales within each quarter of can cause the cost of net revenues percentage to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  gross margins associated with the showstation ip and the soundpoint pro are lower than the targeted gross margins of the total product portfolio  yet the gross margins for the webstation are closer to the targeted gross margins 
the contribution of these products in can have a significant impact on the company s overall gross margins 
there can be no assurances on achieving profitability targets due to these and other uncertainties 
polycom s historical price reductions have been driven by polycom s desire to expand the market for its products  and polycom may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry higher costs in order to further expand the market or to respond to competitive pricing pressures 
there can be no assurance that such actions by polycom will expand the market for its products or be sufficient to meet competitive pricing pressures 
in the future  the cost of net revenue percentage may be affected by price competition and changes in unit volume shipments  product cost and warranty expenses 
the cost of net revenues percentage may also be impacted by the mix of distribution channels used by polycom  the mix of products sold and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
polycom typically realizes lower cost of net revenue percentages on direct sales than on sales through indirect channels 
if sales through resellers  especially oems  increase as a percentage of total revenues  polycom s cost of net revenues percentage would be materially adversely impacted 
sales and marketing expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in over was primarily related to increased investment in the videoconferencing sales effort 
as mentioned previously  the company only began selling the viewstation products in and  consequently  had little sales and marketing expense in associated with these products 
additionally  increases in the audioconferencing sales efforts in have also contributed to the overall increase over when comparing to  the sales and marketing expense increase was related to the launch of polycom s dataconferencing and videoconferencing products 
the company expects to continue to increase its sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts in an effort to expand north american and international markets  market new products and establish and expand distribution channels 
in particular  due to the innovative nature of the showstation ip  webstation  viewstation products and meetingsite product  the company believes it will be required to incur significant additional expenses for sales and marketing  especially advertising  to educate potential customers as to the desirability of these products 
in addition  the company is currently making a significant investment in the european market which will decentralize the marketing and sales effort for this region  thereby  increasing the absolute dollars spent in this area 
also  the launch of the meetingsite product  a multipoint conferencing unit mcu product  which provides connectability for large multipoint videoconference calls  will cause an increase in the company s sales and marketing expenses 
additionally  this mcu market is new for polycom and significant investments may need to be made to become successful 
further  polycom is currently expanding the service organization to provide expanded and improved support for its video  data and multipoint conferencing products which will increase the company s sales and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  consulting fees  an allocation of overhead expense  supplies and depreciation 
the expense decrease in when compared to was primarily attributable to higher development expenses for the showstation ip and viewstation products in which resulted in the initial launch of these products in early for the remainder of  the development charges for these products normalized 
these decreases were offset somewhat by increases related to the audioconferencing product line 
the increase in dollar amount in research and development expenses in over was primarily attributable to increased staffing and associated support required to expand and enhance polycom s dataconferencing and videoconferencing product lines 
as of december   all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
the company believes that technological leadership is critical to its success and is committed to continuing a high level of research and development 
consequently  the company intends to increase its research and development expenses in absolute dollars in the future 
general and administrative expenses increase decrease year end december  from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  an allocation of overhead expense  and outside legal and accounting expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in when compared to is due to lower legal expenses associated with the vtel and datapoint lawsuits 
this decrease was offset by increases related to increased staffing and infrastructure to support the company s growth 
additionally  during the third quarter of  the company reversed a contingency reserve associated with the datapoint litigation which was resolved favorably during the quarter 
the increase in dollar amount in over was primarily due to increased staffing  including the hiring of a president at the beginning of  to support polycom s growth 
the company believes that its general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of the company s administrative staff and costs related to supporting a larger company 
these additional charges include expenses related to a new information system and infrastructure charges related to the investments being made in europe 
acquisition expenses the company incurred expenses totaling million and million in and  respectively  related to the acquisition of viavideo 
a significant portion of these charges was for outside legal  accounting and consulting services 
management does not anticipate any further material viavideo acquisition related expenses  however  there can be no assurances that other expenses related to acquisition activity will not be incurred or  if incurred  will not be material 
other income and expense and provision for income taxes interest income consists of interest earned on polycom s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense is from polycom s bank debt facilities 
interest income  net of interest expense was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the fluctuations in interest income  net are due primarily to changes in average cash balances throughout the year 
polycom accounts for income taxes in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
in  and  polycom s provision for income taxes was million  million and million  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in and were primarily for federal alternative minimum and certain foreign taxes 
as of december   polycom had approximately million in federal net operating loss carryforwards and million in federal tax credit carryforwards as well as other deferred tax assets arising from timing differences 
polycom has established a valuation allowance against a portion of these deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets given the company s only recent return to profitability  the strong competition from picturetel  the largest competitor in the videoconferencing market  and the lack of backlog in the sales cycle 
management evaluates on a quarterly basis the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance and  accordingly  the valuation allowance may change based upon the company s financial performance and market condition 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be appropriately reduced 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as the year approaches  these code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with 
as a result  in less than one year  computer systems and or software products used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company is currently expending resources to review its internal use software in order to identify and modify those systems that are not year compliant 
the company s products and services have already been reviewed and certified to be year compliant 
the costs associated with this effort may be incremental to the company and also represent a reallocation of existing resources 
in addition  the company has initiated a project to replace its current internal business information system 
while this effort will also address the year issues of the legacy system  this internal system implementation effort is principally being conducted to improve operating efficiencies 
polycom takes seriously the potential issues that could arise due to the year impact on internal systems  facilities  and its suppliers 
in connection with the year initiative  the company is working to assure that its internal systems  facilities  and suppliers are year compliant in advance of january  the schedule for this program and percentage of tasks complete are as follows scheduled year initiative phases complete completion conduct inventory survey suppliers assess year compliance develop action contingency plans assess need to implement contingencies complete upgrades replacements the results of our assessments to date are that of polycom product are year compliant 
of the inventoried internal systems  are year compliant  require an upgrade  require replacement  and require completion of the assessment 
because the company is in the early phases of its year initiative  the efforts required to become year compliant have not been fully identified 
therefore  the company does not know the total costs associated with correcting the year problem 
the company believes  however  that it is unlikely to experience a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations due to year compliance issues 
costs related to the year issue incurred to date have been insignificant less than  and have been expensed as incurred 
a budget of  was established for software and hardware upgrades  while the replacement of the internal business information system is funded under a separate budget 
all other costs associated with the year project will be expensed as incurred 
additionally  the company expects to fund the year project through cash generated from operations 
however  since the assessment process is ongoing  the year complications are not fully known  and potential liability issues are not clear  the full potential impact of the year on the company is not known at this time 
as mentioned above  polycom has begun efforts on a business systems replacement project 
the new system  which will make the company s business computer systems fully year compliant  is scheduled for completion by the end of a contingency plan has been developed to make the systems that are scheduled to be replaced year compliant 
a decision to implement the contingency plan would be made no later than the middle of  with completion by the end of this contingency plan would be invoked if it is determined that any material risk exists that the business systems replacement project would slip beyond the end of to date  no significant projects have been delayed due to the year project 
it is not expected that any significant project will be delayed in the future if the current year plan meets the compliance objectives and does not significantly change 
however  if events occur that require the company to implement its year contingency plan  the new business system implementation may be delayed three to six months which is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
polycom is highly dependent on the performance of services by key suppliers  such as the company s banking institutions  manufacturing partners  and communications suppliers 
due to the general uncertainty of the year readiness of suppliers services  the company is unable to determine at this time whether there is any risk associated with the year readiness of the company s suppliers 
the consequences of year failures on the part of said suppliers would have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
it is unlikely that a failure to correct a material year problem will result in an interruption  or a failure  of certain normal business activities or operations 
although significant efforts would be required  any year problem in business activities or operations could be accommodated through manual efforts in the short term 
the company believes that with the completion of the year compliance project and the implementation of new business systems as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
however  if the company s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition  or if the company does not achieve all of the key factors associated with the company s efforts to comply with year requirements  then the company s results from operations  liquidity or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources for the three years ended december  as of december   polycom s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
additionally  the company established a million revolving bank line of credit from silicon valley bank 
this line of credit allows for an additional facility of million available upon request by the company and contingent upon payment of associated fees 
the line of credit facility contains provisions that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and profitability requirements 
as of december   polycom was in compliance with these covenants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
polycom used cash in operating activities totaling million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
the improvement in cash from operating activities in over was due primarily to the improvement in net income before non cash items and a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset somewhat by the growth in receivables and inventory 
when comparing to  the decline in cash from operating activities was due to the net loss before considering non cash items compared to net income in  offset somewhat by the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million proceeds from issuance of stock  mainly from the purchase of stock worth million by m 
the primary uses of cash during were purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and cash used in operating activities of million 
the use of cash in operating activities was primarily the result of higher accounts receivable  due to a larger portion of revenue realized at the end of the year and higher inventory levels 
this was offset somewhat by a positive net income before considering non cash expenses such as depreciation and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company s material commitments consist of obligations under its revolving bank line of credit  operating leases and a  stand by letter of credit which has been issued to guarantee certain of the company s contractual obligations 
the company also maintains  from time to time  commercial letters of credit as payments for the importation of certain products 
the amounts do not exceed  and are outstanding less than days 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its available cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements through at least december  however  it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty how successful the company will be at growing the market for its products  if at all 
if there is substantial growth and  as a result  the company goes beyond current acceptable liquidity levels  or if the financial results were to violate the financial covenants of the bank line of credit  polycom may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions or competitive reasons  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company and would not be dilutive 
the company s future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 software for internal use  which provides guidance on accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of sop no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
the company is required to adopt sfas in fiscal sfas established methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
the company has not yet determined what the effect sfas will be on the operations and financial position of the company 
other factors affecting future operations polycom s net revenues have grown primarily through increased market acceptance of its established soundstation  soundstation premier and the initial acceptance of the viewstation product lines  other new product introductions and through the expansion of polycom s north american and international distribution networks 
while polycom has experienced growth in net revenues in recent quarters  it does not believe that the historical growth rates in net revenues will be sustainable nor are they indicative of future operating results 
for example  polycom believes that the price reduction in the north american list price of its soundstation product line  effective december for resellers and january for end user customers  and the price reduction for soundstation products sold internationally effective april  negatively impacted polycom s net revenues and profitability in additionally  the company lowered the price of the showstation ip effective march due to market acceptance issues for this product 
further  recent growth rates of audio and video product sales out from the sales channels to end users have been significant 
future growth rates may not achieve these levels of success which would have a material adverse affect on polycom s revenue growth and profitability 
polycom believes that profitability could continue to be negatively affected in the future as a result of several factors including low to negative gross margins for the showstation ip and continuing competitive price pressure in the conferencing equipment market 
although price reductions have been driven by polycom s desire to expand the market for its products  and polycom expects that in the future it may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to further expand the market or to respond to competitive pricing pressures  there can be no assurance that such actions by polycom will expand the market for its products or be sufficient to meet competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  if the webstation product materially negatively affects the future sales of the showstation ip  the company s total revenue could be significantly adversely affected and it could create an excess and obsolescence issue concerning the showstation ip inventory which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
similarly  if the soundpoint pro product materially negatively affects the future sales of the soundpoint product  the company s total revenue could be significantly adversely affected and it could create an excess and obsolescence issue concerning the soundpoint inventory which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
in addition  costs related to the merger with viavideo  and its integration into polycom  and expense growth related to the activities of the combined entities could negatively impact future profitability 
further  costs related to the introduction of the new showstation ip  viewstation  soundstation satellite  webstation  meetingsite and soundpoint pro products could also negatively impact future profitability 
also  the impacts of pending or future litigation against polycom or viavideo  including the suit filed by vtel against viavideo  as mentioned in polycom s form k filed on september   beyond that already provided in the company s balance sheet as of december   are difficult to predict at this time 
further  polycom s limited operating history and limited resources  among other factors  make the prediction of future operating results difficult  if not impossible 
in the past polycom has experienced delays from time to time in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements and believes that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  the introduction of showstation was delayed by approximately eighteen months from the originally anticipated date of introduction because of unforeseen technical challenges and difficulties in building core technologies and  for approximately nine weeks in the first quarter of  shipments were interrupted in order to correct software and other technical problems identified by initial customers 
in addition  soundstation premier first customer shipments were delayed from its original shipment target of september to november and showstation ip was delayed from its original shipment target of september to its first customer shipment date of march due to engineering and manufacturing start up issues 
polycom also experienced delays in introducing the webstation and viewstation mp in from their original expected release dates 
any similar delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on polycom s results of operations 
polycom s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  including market acceptance of viewstation  soundpoint pro  webstation  showstation ip  meetingsite and other new product introductions and product enhancements by polycom or its competitors  the prices of polycom s or its competitors products  the mix of products sold  the mix of products sold directly and through resellers  fluctuations in the level of international sales  the cost and availability of components  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  changes in polycom s distribution network  the level of royalties to third parties and changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  competitive pressure on pricing or demand levels in a given quarter could adversely affect polycom s operating results for such period  and such price pressure over an extended period could materially adversely affect polycom s long term profitability 
polycom s ability to maintain or increase net revenues will depend upon its ability to increase unit sales volumes of the soundstation  soundstation premier and soundpoint families of products  the showstation and webstation line of products  the viewstation product line  and any new products or product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that polycom will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  introduce and sell new products or reduce its costs as a percentage of net revenues 
in  polycom began marketing and selling its meetingsite product which is a multipoint conference product manufactured by lucent technologies 
because polycom is reselling lucent s product  the gross margins for this business are significantly lower than the rest of polycom s product portfolio 
additionally  this product is new for polycom and significant investments in marketing  sales  service and other areas may need to be made to successfully sell this product 
there can be no guarantee that the mcu business will ever be profitable 
polycom typically ships products within a short time after receipt of an order and historically has no material backlog and backlog fluctuates significantly from period to period 
as a result  backlog  at any point in time  is not a good indicator of future net revenues and net revenues for any particular quarter cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy 
accordingly  polycom s expectations for both short and long term future net revenues are based almost exclusively on its own estimate of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
in addition  polycom typically receives orders and ships a substantial percentage of the total products sold during a particular quarter in the last few weeks of the quarter 
often these orders consist of distributor stocking orders and  typically each quarter  polycom has provided special incentives for distributors to purchase more than the minimum quantities required under their agreements with polycom 
additionally  a majority of polycom s net revenues are from sales to resellers who sell the products through to end users 
if these resellers are unable to sell through their inventory of polycom products in a given quarter  it could affect the volume of polycom s sales to these resellers in future quarters 
this is especially true for new product channel shipments  such as the viewstation  viewstation v  viewstation mp and webstation shipments  in the fourth quarter of further  polycom depends significantly on sales to resellers  many of whom are undercapitalized yet carry multiple polycom product lines 
failure of these business to establish and sustain profitability could significantly affect future revenue levels for polycom 
also  since a substantial portion of polycom s orders are received and shipped within the last few weeks of a quarter  should polycom  its supplier or major customers be subject to a business interruption  for example  a natural disaster  during the last few weeks of a quarter  it would have a material adverse impact on polycom s results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of these and other factors  polycom has been uncertain  throughout most of each quarter  as to the level of revenues it will achieve in the quarter and the impact that distributor stocking orders will have on revenues and profitability in that quarter and subsequent quarters 
in addition  because a substantial percentage of product sales occur at the end of the quarter  product mix and  therefore  profitability is difficult  if not impossible  to predict 
the company depends on these third party resellers for a substantial portion of its revenue 
certain of these third party resellers also act as resellers for competitors of the company that can devote greater effort and resources to marketing competitive products 
the loss of certain of these third party resellers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
further  there can be no guarantee that polycom s contract manufacturers will be able to meet product demand before any given quarter ends 
polycom anticipates that this pattern of sales may continue in the future with the exception that the company may reduce and ultimately eliminate the end of quarter incentives offered to distributors 
if the company chooses to eliminate or reduce stocking incentive programs  quarterly revenue may be materially adversely affected 
expense levels are based  in part  on these estimates and  since polycom is limited in its ability to reduce expenses quickly if orders and net revenues do not meet expectations in a particular period  operating results would be adversely affected 
in addition  a seasonal demand appears to have developed for polycom s products particularly evident in a lag in demand during the summer months 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters polycom s operating results will be materially below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of polycom s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
polycom has various oem agreements with some major telecommunications equipment manufacturers whereby polycom manufactures its products to work with the equipment of the oem partner 
these partnerships can create channel conflicts with other polycom distributors who directly compete with polycom s oem partner  which could adversely affect revenue from such non oem channels 
additionally  polycom has its own direct sales organization which could at times compete with other polycom resellers for national account  government or other business 
because many of the company s distributors also sell equipment that competes with the polycom product lines  the distributors could devote more attention to the other product lines which could materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
further  other channel conflicts could arise which cause distributors to devote resources to other non polycom conferencing equipment thereby materially adversely affecting polycom s financial position or results of operations 
the company has several distribution and marketing agreements with m whereby m purchases video and data products from polycom and provides a royalty revenue stream for polycom 
if m is unsuccessful in the videoconferencing and dataconferencing equipment business  it would significantly reduce the amount of product they purchase from polycom and the royalty revenue stream associated with it 
this could materially adversely affect future profitability for polycom 
polycom experienced significant revenue growth in this growth was due in large part to new product introductions in the videoconferencing product line 
in fact  each quarter of had a major new video product introduction which significantly contributed to the revenue growth 
although new product releases are planned for there can be no assurance that releases will happen when planned or that they will happen at all 
additionally  there can be no guarantee that any new product introductions in will produce the revenue growth experienced in in  polycom will make a significant investment in europe to expand its business in this region 
in europe  as with other international regions  credit terms are typically longer than in the united states 
therefore  as europe and other international regions grow as a percentage of polycom s total revenues  accounts receivable balances will likely increase over previous years 
additionally  sales in the videoconferencing product market typically have longer payment periods over polycom s traditional experience in the audioconferencing market 
therefore  as polycom sells more video products as a percentage of its revenue  accounts receivable balances will increase over previous experience 
these increases will cause polycom s days sales outstanding dso to increase over prior years and will negatively affect future cash flows 
during the third quarter of  the company traded million of soundpoint inventory for barter trade credits 
these trade credits are convertible into a variety of goods or services  but the company believes that a majority of them will be used for media advertising 
no revenue was recorded on this transaction and it had no impact on net income 
as of december   the trade credits are classified as a prepaid asset at their net realizable value which approximates the original value of the inventory 
the credits have no expiration date 
if the company subsequently determines that it cannot utilize these trade credits  it could have a material adverse impact on its profitability 
the markets for videoconferencing products are characterized by changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of polycom s new viewstation products is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of polycom s competitors and market acceptance of these products 
additionally  properly addressing the complexities associated with isdn compatibility  reseller training  technical and sales support as well as field support are also factors that may affect the company s success in this market 
further  the shift of communications from the circuit switched to ip network over time may require polycom to add new resellers and gain new core technological competencies 
polycom is attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through its internal development efforts and joint developments with other companies 
there can be no assurance that polycom will successfully identify new videoconferencing product opportunities and develop and bring new videoconferencing products to market in a timely manner  or that videoconferencing products and technologies developed by others will not render polycom s viewstation products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of polycom s new videoconferencing products development efforts would have a material adverse effect on polycom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
polycom subcontracts the manufacture of its soundstation  soundstation premier  soundpoint pro and viewstation product families to celestica  inc  a global third party contract manufacturer 
polycom uses celestica s thailand facilities and should there be any disruption in supply due to recent economic and political difficulties in thailand and asia  such disruption would have a material adverse effect on polycom s business  financial condition and result of operations 
in addition  operating in the international environment exposes polycom to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences all of which could have a material adverse effect on polycom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  celestica recently merged operations with international manufacturing services  inc ims  the company with which polycom had the original contracted manufacturing relationship 
the impact of this merger agreement on polycom is currently unknown but could have a material adverse impact on polycom s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company operates in a high technology market which is subject to rapid and frequent technology changes 
these technology changes can and do often render existing technologies obsolete 
these obsolescence issues can require write downs in inventory value when it is determined that the existing inventory can not be sold at or above net realizable value 
this situation occurred for the original showstation product and during the third quarter of  polycom wrote down an additional million related to the loss in value associated with this inventory 
there can be no guarantee that this situation will not occur again for any product in polycom s inventory 
polycom completed the acquisition of viavideo communications  inc on january  polycom acquired viavideo with the expectation that the acquisition would result in operating and strategic benefits  including operating cost reductions and product development  marketing and sales synergies 
although there have not been material difficulties to date  if outstanding merger related issues are not successfully addressed in a coordinated  timely and efficient manner  polycom s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely effected 
the integration of viavideo s product offerings and operations with polycom s product offerings and operations and the coordination of video sales and marketing efforts with those of polycom require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse affect on polycom s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the difficulties of assimilation may be increased by the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining two different corporate cultures 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of either or both of the companies businesses  which could have an adverse effect on the combined operations 
as a result of the acquisition  polycom s operating expenses have significantly increased in absolute dollars 
should future expected revenues from viavideo products not occur  or occur later or in an amount less than expected  the higher operating expenses could have a material adverse affect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of polycom 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies could have a material adverse effect upon the business  operating results or financial condition of polycom 
additionally  there can be no assurance that polycom will not incur additional material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with the acquisition 
polycom currently has agreements with certain videoconferencing equipment providers whereby these equipment suppliers resell polycom s soundpoint pc products along with their videoconferencing products 
polycom and these equipment suppliers are competitors in the conferencing market and  as such  there can be no assurance that they will enter into future agreements to resell or supply any of the company s new or enhanced conferencing products 
further  certain current polycom video products and other video products under development at polycom are directly competitive with the products of these suppliers  and thus competition between polycom and the other suppliers is likely to increase  resulting in a strain on the existing relationship between the companies 
if this occurs  it could limit the potential contribution of these relationships on the financial results of operations of polycom 
the company s overall business grew significantly in this level of growth  if it persists  could cause strains on the normal business processes and infrastructure of the company 
if polycom does not manage this growth through resource additions such as headcount and capital  in a timely and efficient manner  future growth and profitability will likely be significantly negatively affected 
there can be no assurances that resources will be available when the company needs them or that capital will be available to fund these resource needs 
polycom s stock price has varied greatly as has the volume of shares of the company s common stock that has traded 
the company expects these fluctuations to continue due to factors such as announcements of new products  services or technological innovations by polycom or its competitors  announcements of major restructurings by polycom or its competitors  quarterly variations in polycom s results of operations  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community  general conditions in the conferencing equipment industry  changes in the company s revenue growth rates or the growth rates of polycom s competitors  and sales of large blocks of the company s stock 
the stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many technology companies  such as polycom  have experienced such fluctuations 
in addition  polycom s stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to the company s performance 
often such fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the market price for polycom s common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
polycom s operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond polycom s control 
additionally  most of polycom s operations are currently located in the san francisco bay area  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes 
polycom does not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate polycom for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by polycom could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or operating results
