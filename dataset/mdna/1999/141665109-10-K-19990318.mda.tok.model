our actual growth  results  performance and business prospects and opportunities in and beyond could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  any such forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements on page for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such material differences 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
background and overview we are a provider of private  for profit postsecondary education in north america  with approximately  students enrolled as of october  we operate schools  with campuses located in states and two canadian provinces 
our schools enjoy long operating histories and offer a variety of bachelor s degree  associate degree and non degree programs in career oriented disciplines within our core curricula of 
information technologies 
visual communication and design technologies 
business studies 
culinary arts we have experienced significant growth both internally and through acquisitions 
net revenue and ebitda have increased in each of the years we have operated 
our net revenue increased to million in  from million in and ebitda increased to million in  from a loss of million in we have invested significant amounts of capital in the hiring of additional personnel and increased marketing and capital improvements at each of the schools we have acquired 
we have also hired additional corporate staff to support our continued growth 
the increased costs of personnel and marketing are expensed as incurred and are reflected in general and administrative expenses 
additional depreciation and amortization is reflected as a result of the capital improvements 
we believe that ebitda  while not a substitute for generally accepted accounting principles measures of operating results  is an important measure of our financial performance and that of our schools 
our management believes that ebitda is particularly meaningful due principally to the role acquisitions have played in our development 
our rapid growth through acquisitions has resulted in significant non cash depreciation and amortization expense  because a significant portion of the purchase price of a school acquired by us is generally allocated to fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of our ongoing acquisition strategy  non cash amortization expense may continue to be substantial 
our principal source of revenue is tuition collected from our students 
the academic year is at least weeks in length  but varies both by individual school and program of study 
the academic year is divided by term  which is determined by start dates which vary by school and program 
payment of each term s tuition may be made by full cash payment  financial aid and or an installment payment plan 
if a student withdraws from school prior to the completion of the term  we refund the portion of tuition already paid which is attributable to the period of the term that is not completed 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the student s program 
our campuses charge tuition at varying amounts  depending not only on the particular school  but also upon the type of program and the specific curriculum 
each of our campuses typically implements one or more tuition increases annually 
other revenue consists of bookstore sales  placement fees  dormitory and cafeteria fees and restaurant revenue 
other revenue is recognized during the period services are rendered 
educational services and facilities expense includes costs directly attributable to the educational activity of our schools  including salaries and benefits of faculty  academic administrators and student support personnel 
educational services and facilities expense also includes costs of educational supplies and facilities including rents on school leases  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories  costs of student housing and all other physical plant and occupancy costs  with the exception of costs attributable to our corporate offices 
general and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits of personnel in recruitment  admissions  accounting  personnel  compliance and corporate and school administration 
costs of promotion and development  advertising and production of marketing materials  and occupancy of the corporate offices are also included in this expense category 
depreciation and amortization includes costs associated with the depreciation of purchased computer laboratories  equipment  furniture and fixtures  courseware  owned facilities  capitalized equipment leases and amortization of intangible assets  primarily goodwill and non competition agreements with the previous owners of our schools 
acquisitions on february   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of the school of computer technology for a purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  we paid approximately million to the former owners of the school of computer technology pursuant to non competition agreements 
effective may   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of gibbs for a purchase price of approximately million 
in addition  we paid million to the former owner of gibbs pursuant to a non competition agreement 
on june   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of the international academy of merchandising design for an initial purchase price of million  which amount was further increased by million during  based on the results of the international academy of merchandising design operations and the calculation of the final purchase price adjustment 
in addition  we paid million to the former owners of the international academy of merchandising design pursuant to covenants not to compete 
also on june   we acquired all of the capital stock of international academy of design for a purchase price of million 
in addition  we paid million to the former owners of international academy of design pursuant to covenants not to compete 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of southern california school of culinary arts for a purchase price of approximately million 
on july   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of scottsdale culinary 
the purchase price was approximately million 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of harrington for a purchase price of approximately million  subject to adjustment 
on march   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of mcintosh college 
the purchase price was approximately million  subject to adjustment

net tuition revenue increased  from million in to million in  due to an approximately increase in the average number of students attending the schools which were owned by us during and tuition increases effective in for these schools  as well as added net tuition revenue of million for schools acquired during and after other net revenue increased  from million in to million in  due to an increase in student population for schools owned during the period 
educational services and facilities expense 
educational services and facilities expense increased  from million in to million in of this increase  million was attributable to the increase in student population for schools owned during and million was attributable to the addition of educational services and facilities for schools acquired during and after general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to million of expenses for schools acquired during and after  costs totaling million related to increased personnel at the corporate level to enhance our infrastructure  and increased advertising and marketing including admissions of million for schools owned during the increase in advertising and marketing expenses reflected  in part  the fact that the former owners of the acquired schools had reduced their expenditures in these areas prior to our acquisition of the schools 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million in to million in the increase was due to increased capital expenditures for schools owned during and related increased depreciation expense of million in additionally  depreciation expense increased million due to the depreciation expense for schools acquired during and after amortization expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to additional amortization of non competition agreements and goodwill for the acquisition of schools after compensation expense related to the initial public offering 
pursuant to amended stock option agreements with two stockholders  compensation expense totaling approximately million was recognized upon consummation of our initial public offering in february interest expense 
interest expense decreased  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of indebtedness resulting from the application of the net proceeds of our initial public offering in february provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision benefit for income taxes increased from a million benefit in to a million provision in as a result of changes in pretax income loss 
net income loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
net income loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle increased to a net income of million in from a net loss of million in extraordinary item

in connection therewith  we recorded a charge of million  net of tax 
net income loss 
net income loss increased to a net income of million in from a net loss of million in  due to the factors noted above 
net income loss attributable to common stockholders 
net income loss attributable to common stockholders increased from a loss of million in to net income of million in the primary reason for this increase was due to the increase in net income loss discussed above and decreases in dividends on preferred stock and accretion to redemption value of preferred stock and warrants in connection with our initial public offering 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
net tuition revenue increased from million in to million in  due to an approximately increase in the average number of students attending the schools which were owned by us during and tuition increases effective in for these schools  as well as added net tuition revenue of million for schools acquired after other net revenue increased  from million in to million in  due to an increase in student population for schools owned during and the addition of million from schools acquired after educational services and facilities expense 
educational services and facilities expense increased  from million in to million in of this increase  million was attributable to the increase in student population and associated facility costs for schools owned during and million was attributable to the addition of educational services and facilities for schools acquired after general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to costs totaling million related to increased personnel at the corporate level to enhance our infrastructure and increased advertising and marketing  including admissions  of million for schools owned during  as well as the addition of million of expenses for schools acquired after the increase in advertising and marketing expenses reflected  in part  the fact that the former owners of the acquired schools had reduced their expenditures in these areas prior to their acquisition by us 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million in to million in the increase was due to increased capital expenditures for schools owned during and related increased depreciation expense of million in additionally  depreciation expense increased million due to the depreciation expense for schools acquired after amortization expense increased from an immaterial amount in to million in  primarily due to additional amortization of non competition agreements for the acquisition of schools after interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to interest expense on borrowings used to finance the acquisition of schools after provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes increased from a provision in of million to a benefit of million in income loss before extraordinary item 
net income loss before extraordinary item decreased to a net loss of million in from net income before extraordinary item of million in  due to the factors noted above 
extraordinary item 
during  we recorded an extraordinary expense of million  net of tax  due to the early retirement of debt related to a credit facility which was terminated and replaced by our current credit facility 
net income loss 
net income loss decreased to a net loss of million in from net income of million in  due to the factors noted above 
net income loss attributable to common stockholders 
net income attributable to common stockholders decreased from million in to a loss of million in the primary reasons for this decrease were the extraordinary item referred to above  increased dividends on preferred stock  primarily due to the issuance of additional shares  and increased accretion in the redemption value of preferred stock and warrants as a result of our growth 
all outstanding preferred stock converted into common stock and all outstanding warrants were exercised prior to the consummation of our initial public offering 
seasonality our results of operations fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment at our schools 
our schools experience a seasonal increase in new enrollments in the fall  traditionally when the largest numbers of new high school graduates begin postsecondary education 
furthermore  although we encourage year round attendance at all schools  some schools have summer breaks for some of their programs 
as a result of these factors  total student enrollment and net revenue are typically highest in the fourth quarter  which is october through december  and lowest in the second quarter  which is april through june  of our fiscal year 
our costs and expenses do not  however  fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis 
we anticipate that these seasonal trends will continue 
liquidity and capital resources on february   we sold  of our shares of common stock at per share pursuant to our initial public offering 
we used net proceeds from that offering totaling million to repay borrowings of million under our former credit facility and amounts owed to former owners of acquired businesses of million which were outstanding at that time 
prior to that offering  we financed our operating activities through cash generated from operations  and we financed acquisitions through a combination of additional equity investments and credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from net cash used of million in  due primarily to increases in net income and depreciation and amortization and the result of the non cash compensation expense related to options 
capital expenditures increased to million in from million in these increases were primarily due to investments in capital equipment as a result of increasing student population 
we expect capital expenditures to continue to increase as new schools are acquired  student population increases and current facilities and equipment are upgraded and expanded 
our net receivables as a percentage of net revenue decreased to in from in this change was primarily due to increased revenues at schools acquired during based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
when a student withdraws  the receivable balance attributable to such student is charged to this allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and has ranged from to 
in october  we refinanced our credit agreement 
we can borrow up to million under a revolving credit facility million of which may be drawn in canadian dollars  such amount is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
we can obtain up to million in letters of credit 
the credit agreement matures on october  our borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  payable quarterly  at either the bank s base or prime rate depending on whether the particular loan is denominated in us or canadian dollars  plus a specified number of basis points  ranging from to  based upon our leverage ratio or libor  plus a specified number of basis points  ranging from to based upon our leverage ratio 
under the credit agreement  we are required  among other things  to maintain financial ratios with respect to debt to ebitda and interest coverage and a specified level of net worth 
we are also subject to limitations on  among other things  payment of dividends  disposition of assets and incurrence of additional indebtedness 
we are required to pledge the stock of our subsidiaries as collateral for the repayment of our obligations under the credit agreement 
at december   we had approximately million of outstanding letters of credit and million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
as a result  at december   our remaining credit availability under the credit agreement was approximately million 
we are currently in the process of amending the credit agreement to increase the credit facility from million to million 
we cannot assure you that the credit facility will be increased 
market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
we have not entered into interest rate caps or collars or other hedging instruments 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under revolving credit agreements  which have variable interest rates tied to the prime and libor rates 
the weighted average annual interest rate of these credit agreements and bank note payables was at december  in addition  we had debt with fixed annual rates of interest of totaling million at december  we estimate that the fair value of each of our debt instruments approximated its market value at december  we are subject to fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar vis a vis the us dollar 
our investment in our canadian operations is not significant and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of these operations at december  approximated their fair value 
year compliance the year problem 
many it hardware and software systems and non it systems containing embedded technology  such as microcontrollers and microchip processors  can only process dates with six digits  for example   instead of eight digits  for example  this limitation may cause it systems and non it systems to experience problems processing information with dates after december  for example  could be processed as or there could also be problems with other dates  such as september   which was a date traditionally used as a default date by computer programmers 
these problems may cause it systems and non it systems to suffer miscalculations  malfunctions or disruptions 
these problems are commonly referred to as year problems 
in late  we began our audit  testing and remediation project to assess our exposure to year problems both because of our own it systems and non it systems and because of the systems of our significant vendors  including those who process and disburse student financial aid for us 
the discussion below details our efforts to ensure year compliance 
our state of readiness 
through our audit  testing and remediation project  we have identified and evaluated the readiness of our it systems and non it systems  which  if not year compliant  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we held planning strategy sessions in the first quarter of and conducted our year audits  upgrade assessments and budget alignments during the remainder of our evaluation indicated that our administrative it systems are year compliant  but identified the following areas of concern 
our accounting and financial reporting system 
our student database system 
the systems of third party vendors which process student financial aid applications and loans for us 
the department of education s systems for processing and disbursing student financial aid 
financial institutions which provide loans to our students based on our assessment and vendors representations  we believe that the financial and accounting systems  including those necessary for financial aid  of our significant third party vendors will be year compliant by mid year we believe that the material non it systems that we control are year compliant and have begun the process of surveying our landlords  utility providers and other providers of non it systems to confirm that such systems are compliant 
we expect to complete this process in the second quarter of we also expect that all of our year testing will be completed by the second quarter of the risks associated with our year issues 
although we are unable at this time to quantify with certainty our internal costs resulting from our year problems  we do not believe that the cost of remediating our internal year problems or the lost opportunity costs arising from any necessary diversion of our personnel to year problems will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we estimate that the cost of replacing non compliant servers and desktop computers to be approximately  alternatively  we estimate that the cost of upgrading such servers and desktop computers to be approximately  the choice to replace or upgrade these servers and computers will be made on a case by case basis 
we believe the greatest year compliance risk  in terms of magnitude  is that the department of education may fail to complete its remediation efforts in a timely manner and federal student financial aid funding for our students could be interrupted for a period of time 
during any such time  students may not be able to pay their tuition in a timely matter 
because we derive approximately of our revenue from us federal student financial aid programs  such delay is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
other than public comments provided by the department of education that contingency plans have been drafted and will be tested by march   we are unable to predict the likelihood of this risk occurring 
according to the department of education  its systems should be brought into certifiable compliance by the end of march  contingency plans 
at this time  we expect to be year compliant and are satisfied that our significant vendors are or will be compliant 
however  to avoid interruptions of our operations  we have begun developing contingency plans in the event that we experience any year problems 
with respect to it systems  we have distributed guidelines to each of our campuses regarding data backup practices to store the information for our critical business processes in case any of them experience year problems 
our contingency plan with respect to the material non it systems that we control includes  among other things  investigating the availability and replacement cost of such non it systems that have year problems  isolating such systems that are not year compliant so that they do not affect other systems and adjusting the clocks on such non it systems that are not date sensitive 
we do not believe that the total costs of such year compliance activities will be material
