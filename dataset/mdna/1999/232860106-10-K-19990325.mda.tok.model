year compliance d e has not experienced any significant year problems to date and does not expect any significant problems to impair its operations as it transitions to the new century 
however  due to the magnitude and complexity of the year issue  even the most conscientious efforts cannot guarantee every problem will be found and corrected prior to january  d e is focusing on critical operating and business systems and has developed contingency plans in the event problems should occur 
d e established a year committee in which has targeted the following key areas telecommunications operating systems  internal information technology applications customer  business and human resources information systems  internal computer hardware and software infrastructure and contingency plans 
of these areas  d e believes the telecommunications systems have the most impact on d e s ability to provide service to its customers

costs d e estimates its total year costs to be less than to date  less than was spent in modifications to the telecommunications systems  billing and financial systems  hardware and software and contingency planning
