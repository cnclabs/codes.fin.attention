see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s development contracts with certain oem customers have enabled efax 
com to accelerate its product development efforts 
the company classifies all development costs related to such contracts as research and development expenses because such development fees have only partially funded the company s product development activities  and the company generally retains ownership of the technology developed under these agreements 
software and technology license fees result from licensing the company s proprietary embedded system technology and desktop software to oems for integration into their products 
these payments can take the form of one time license fees  non refundable prepaid royalties  or recurring per unit royalties 
one time license fees and non refundable prepaid royalties are recognized upon the later of delivery of the contracted technology or satisfaction of contractual milestones  if any 
recurring license revenues from per unit fees paid by the company s oems are recognized upon the manufacture or shipment of products incorporating the company s technology as specified in the related agreements 
the recurring license revenues reported by the company are dependent on the timing and accuracy of product manufacturing or sales reports received from the company s oem customers 
these reports are provided on a quarterly basis which may not coincide with the company s quarter end 
however  the company attempts to get verbal estimates more frequently 
the quarterly reports  as well as any verbal estimates  are subject to delay and potential revision by the oem 
therefore  the company may be unable to estimate such revenues accurately prior to public announcement of the company s quarterly results 
in such an event  the company may subsequently be required to revise its previously reported revenues when it publishes its financial statements or adjust revenues for subsequent periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations and on the price of the company s common stock

the gross margins for the company s branded mfp products have been and are expected to continue to be constrained by the competitive nature of the marketplace  pricing pressures and the greater name recognition of the larger companies with which efax 
com competes

the number of units sold each quarter was relatively flat during the first nine months of  dropping by in the final three month period ended december  the decline in unit shipments in the last quarter was due primarily to inventory level adjustments at one of the company s marketing channel partners  ikon  that began in september and continued through year end

although the mfp revenue and unit increase were item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued symmetrical  this resulted from an improved product mix in neutralized by price declines in the company s major mfp product lines 
the twelve months ended december  included revenues from the lower priced inkjet based jetfax  which accounted for of total units in and less than in  but this improvement in product mix was offset by a decline of in the average selling price of the company s baseline jetfax m and series m laser led mfps from to the number of units sold each quarter was relatively flat during the four quarters of the series m  the new product line of mfps  was introduced at the end of the third quarter  but did not lead to higher unit shipments in the fourth quarter  due to competitive pricing in the market and delays in the placement of orders in the business equipment dealer channel

factors that may affect operating results the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of those risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part iv item of this annual report on form k 
risks associated with internet related revenues 
the market for internet related document communications is very new and is evolving rapidly 
the company expects that a significant portion of its revenues in the future will be generated through its efax service and ancillary products 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s subscriber base will continue to expand rapidly  that users will be willing to pay fees for premium services  or that the subscriber base will grow large enough to be capable of generating advertising revenue 
dependence on intellectual property rights  risk of infringement 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its intellectual property 
to protect its proprietary rights  the company relies on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  patents  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions 
as part of its confidentiality procedures  the company generally enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants  oems and strategic partners and limits access to and distribution of its designs  software and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  the company may be unable to effectively protect its proprietary rights and  in any event  enforcement of the company s proprietary rights may be expensive 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in the company s industry increases  the company s intellectual property increasingly may become the subject of infringement claims 
the company has in the past received communications asserting that the company s trademarks or products infringe the proprietary rights of other parties or seeking indemnification against such infringement 
the company is generally required to agree to indemnify its oems from third party claims asserting such infringement 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company or its oems in the future 
any such claims  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause revenue delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements that may not be available  or available on terms acceptable to the company 
the failure of the company to develop  or license on acceptable terms  a substitute technology could have a material adverse effect on the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company in the past has experienced  and in the future may experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results that have been or may be caused by many factors 
these factors include acceptance and timing of new products integrating fax technology with the internet  the size and timing of development or software licensing agreements  the timing of new introductions or phase out of the company s branded products  fluctuations in end user demand for the company s branded and oem products  and seasonal trends  competition and pricing 
the company expects that its operating results will continue to fluctuate as a result of these and other factors 
the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of a quarter  with such revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
the company s branded products are primarily sold through dealers  and such dealers often place orders for products at or near the end of a quarter 
as a result  because one or more key orders that are scheduled to be booked and shipped at the end of a quarter may be delayed until the beginning of the next quarter or cancelled  revenues for future quarters are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
for these and other reasons  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
it is likely that in future quarters  the company s operating results  from time to time  will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
the accuracy of quarterly license revenues from oems reported by the company has been  and the company believes will continue to be  dependent on the timing and accuracy of product sales reports received from the company s oems 
these reports are provided only on a quarterly basis which may not coincide with the company s quarter and are subject to delay and potential revision by the company s oems 
therefore  the company is required to estimate all of the recurring license revenues from oems for each quarter 
as a result  the company will record an estimate of such revenues prior to public announcement of the company s quarterly results 
in the event the product sales reports received from the company s oems are delayed or subsequently revised  the company may be required to restate its recognized revenues or adjust revenues for subsequent periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and the price of the company s common stock 
possible volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in the company s quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new services by the company or its competitors  announcements of significant acquisitions or strategic partnerships by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  and news reports relating to trends in its markets 
further  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  regardless of its operating performance 
risks associated with change in focus of the company s business 
the company has historically focused primarily on the development  manufacture and sale of its branded mfps and currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of its branded mfps 
the company expects that its revenue growth will be dependent  in part  on expansion of internet based document services and further licensing of the company s embedded system technology and software products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will realize growth in revenues from such sales 
if such growth in revenues does not occur and if revenues from the sale of the company s branded mfps were not to continue at past growth rates  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on continued growth of electronic commerce 
the company intends to derive a significant portion of its revenues from its efax service and ancillary products 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet and online services is a recent phenomenon 
as a result  a sufficiently broad base item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of consumers may not adopt and continue to use the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
web based advertising and selling premium services are relatively new and it is difficult to predict the extent of further growth  if any 
in addition  the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for reasons such as potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure or enabling technologies and performance improvements to support increased levels of internet activity 
if the use of the internet and other online services does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected  if the infrastructure for the internet and online services proves to be inadequate to effectively support expansion  or the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
dependence on oems 
the company has derived a significant portion of its revenues from licensing of its embedded system technology and software and from development services to oems 
the company currently has oem relationships with hewlett packard company  oki data corporation  and konica business systems 
the company anticipates that a significant portion of its revenues will be derived from oems in the future and that the company s revenues will be dependent upon  among other things  the ability and willingness of oems to develop and promote mfps that incorporate the company s technology 
the ability and willingness of these oems to do so is based upon a number of factors  which include the company s ability to complete timely development of turnkey designs for them 
no assurance can be given as to the ability or willingness of the company s oems to continue developing  marketing and selling products incorporating the company s technology 
the loss of any of the company s significant oems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on dealers and distributors 
the company has derived a substantial portion of its revenues from sales of its branded mfps through dealers and distributors 
the company expects that sales of these products through its dealers and distributors will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company currently maintains distribution relationships with dealers associated with ikon office solutions  a national group of office equipment dealers and a 
messerli ag  one of the company s office equipment dealers located in switzerland 
each of the company s dealers and distributors can cease marketing the company s products with limited notice and with little or no penalty 
the loss of one or more of the company s major dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s dealers and distributors also offer competitive products manufactured by third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company s dealers and distributors will give priority to the marketing of the company s products as compared to its competitors products 
any reduction or delay in sales of the company s products by its dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
history of operating losses  accumulated deficit 
the company had annual net losses since inception 
the company s historical losses and certain preferred stock dividends have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
risks associated with technological change 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and needs  and frequent new product introductions 
as the market for internet based document communication and handling grows  it will begin to exert more pressure for advanced features at economical pricing 
the mfp market already expects development and release of new products with better performance and improved features at competitive price points 
as the complexity of product development increases and the expected time to market continues to decrease  the risk and difficulty in meeting such schedules increases as well as the costs to the company and its oems 
in addition  the company  its oems and their competitors  from time to time  may announce new products  capabilities or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s branded products and software and the oem products incorporating the company s technology 
the company s success will depend on  among other things  market acceptance of the company s product offerings and the ability of the company and its oem customers to respond to industry changes and market demands 
any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to the rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and needs  or any significant delay in development or introduction of new and enhanced products and services  could result in a loss of competitiveness or revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
highly competitive industry 
the market for internet related document communication and handling is a newly emerging one and competitors are just beginning to appear 
the company anticipates that it will need to provide good service and scale the business rapidly to meet demand  to create name recognition for the company in advance of those competitors  to build its subscriber base prior to any significant entry by the competition  and to continue to expand and improve on its efax service offerings 
the company s technology  development services and software primarily compete with solutions developed internally by oems 
virtually all of the company s oems have significant investments in their existing solutions and have the substantial resources necessary to develop competing multifunction technologies and software that may be implemented into their products 
the company also competes with technologies  software and development services provided in the mfp market by other systems and software suppliers to oems 
with respect to mfp embedded system technologies  the company competes with  among others  peerless systems corporation  personal computer products  inc and xionics document technologies  inc with respect to desktop software  the company competes with  among others  caere corporation  simplify development corporation  smith micro software  inc  visioneer inc  wordcraft international and xerox 
in the newly evolving market for fax to e mail services  competitors include jfax  an existing business  and callwave  a start up that is just introducing its product 
the market for mfps and related technology and software is highly competitive and characterized by continuous pressure to enhance performance  to introduce new features and to accelerate the release of new products 
the company s branded products compete primarily with the dominant vendors in the fax market  all of whom have substantially greater resources than the company and include  among others  canon inc  panasonic  a division of matsushita electrical industrial co  ltd  pitney bowes inc  ricoh co 
ltd  sharp electronics corporation and xerox 
the company also competes on the basis of vendor name and recognition  technology and software expertise  product functionality  development time and price 
the company anticipates increasing competition for its mfps  technologies  software under development  and internet services 
most of the company s existing competitors  many of its potential competitors and all of the company s oems have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than the company 
in the event that price competition increases  competitive pressures could cause the company to reduce the cost of its efax service offerings  to reduce the price of its branded products  to reduce the amount of royalties received on new licenses and to reduce the fees for its development services in order to maintain existing business and generate additional product sales and license and development revenues  which could reduce profit margins and result in losses and a decrease in market share 
such competitive pressures would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of its senior management  particularly edward r 
prince  iii rudy prince  its president and chief executive officer  and lon radin  its vice president of engineering  and other officers and key employees  some of whom only recently have joined the company 
the company maintains key person life insurance policies on rudy prince and lon radin 
none of the company s officers or key employees are covered by an employment agreement with the company 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  managerial  sales  marketing and operations personnel  many of whom are in great demand 
competition for such personnel  especially engineering  has recently increased significantly 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
effect of rapid growth on existing resources  potential acquisitions 
the company has grown rapidly in recent years 
a continuing period of rapid growth could place a significant strain on the company s item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management  operations and other resources 
the company s ability to manage its growth will require it to continue to invest in its operational  financial and management information systems  procedures and controls  and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage its employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its growth effectively and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may  from time to time  pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets or product lines that complement or expand its existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including the diversion of management s attention  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the potential loss of key employees 
the company has no present commitments nor is it engaged in any discussions or negotiations with respect to possible acquisitions 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by the company will not materially and adversely affect the company or that any such acquisition will enhance the company s business 
dependence on outside suppliers  dependence on sole source suppliers 
the company relies on various suppliers of components for its products 
the company generally buys components under purchase orders and does not have long term agreements with its suppliers 
although alternate suppliers may be readily available for some of these components  for other components it could take an undetermined amount of time to qualify a replacement supplier and order and receive replacement components 
the company does not always maintain sufficient inventory to allow it to fill customer orders without interruption during the time that would be required to obtain an adequate supply of single sourced components 
although the company believes it could develop other sources for single source components  no alternative source currently exists and the process could take several months or longer 
therefore  any interruption in the supply of such components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the components used in the company s products are purchased from suppliers located outside the united states 
foreign manufacturing facilities are subject to risk of changes in governmental policies  imposition of tariffs and import restrictions and other factors beyond the company s control 
there can be no assurance that united states or foreign trading policies will not restrict the availability of components or increase their cost 
any significant increase in component prices or decrease in component availability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain components used in the company s products are available only from one source 
the company is dependent on oki america  inc oki america  as the supplier of major components  including the printer engine  of the series m oki america is also a competitor of the company 
the company is also dependent on american microsystems  inc ami to provide unique application specific integrated circuits asics incorporating the company s imaging and logic circuitry  motorola  inc motorola to provide microprocessors  pixel magic  inc  a subsidiary of oak technology  inc pixel  to provide a specialized imaging processor and conexant systems  inc conexant to provide modem chips 
if oki america  ami  motorola  pixel or conexant were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to the company  or if such suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems which prevented them from supplying the company with the necessary components  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any shortage or interruption in the supply of any of the components used in the company s products  or the inability of the company to procure these components from alternate sources on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international activities 
revenues from sales to the company s customers outside the united states account for a significant portion of the company s total revenues 
the international market for the company s branded products and products incorporating the company s technology and software is highly competitive 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities also include currency fluctuations and restrictions  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  longer accounts receivable cycles  the imposition of government controls  risks of localizing and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued internationalizing products to local requirements in foreign countries  trade restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of the company s international sales are currently denominated in us dollars and  therefore  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
because of the company s international activities  it faces certain currency exposure and translation risks 
for example  the company purchases certain key components pursuant to purchase contracts denominated in foreign currency 
dependence on single manufacturing facility  risks related to potential disruption 
the company s manufacturing operations are located in its facility in northern california 
in addition  a number of the suppliers of components for the company s products and providers of outsourced assembly  upon which the company relies  are located in northern california 
since the company does not currently operate multiple facilities in different geographic areas  or have alternative sources for many of its components or outsourced assembly  a disruption of the company s manufacturing operations  or the operations of its suppliers  could cause the company to cease or limit its manufacturing operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
readiness for year readiness for year refers to the issue surrounding computer programs that use two digits rather than four to define a given year 
these programs might read a date using as the year rather than the year and which therefore could cause a system failure or miscalculation 
the company s manufacturing facilities date from october and are not believed to be vulnerable in any significant way to year non information technology system failures 
in august the company renovated its existing telephone system at a cost of approximately  also bringing it into year compliance 
the company has invested approximately  and will continue to make certain investments estimated not to exceed  in its software systems and applications to ensure the company s information systems are year compliant 
the necessary funds to support these renovations have come from the company s operating budget and future funding is not anticipated to require special funding outside of historical levels for this item 
the financial impact to the company of the company s year compliance effort has not been and is not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations in any given year 
for example  during and  the company purchased and implemented new manufacturing and accounting information systems with a total capitalized cost of  the company has obtained written assurances from the vendor  qad inc  that the systems are year compliant  but has not conducted internal testing of the system readiness 
the company believes that its current products are year compliant 
certain of the company s older products  which may not be year compliant are no longer under warranty and the company believes it has no obligation related to these products 
if the company is mistaken in this assessment  the company could incur expenses in defending legal actions for breach of contract or causes of action 
there can be no assurances that such expenses will not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as discussed above  the company has recently implemented new information systems and accordingly does not anticipate any internal year issues from those information systems  databases or programs 
however  the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company expects to complete its assessment of the potential impact of these ancillary issues by may  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to detect all potential failures of the company s and or third parties computer systems 
a significant failure of the company s or a third party s computer system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  but the company is unable at this time to assess what might be the extent of such effect 
the company intends to complete a contingency plan by july   detailing actions that would be taken in the event that such a failure occurs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following disclosures about the company s market risk involve forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company faces exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
short term investments 
at december   the company held million in short term investments consisting of high quality financial instruments with an original maturity of from three to fifteen months 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair market value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
foreign currency exchange rate 
historically  the company s primary exposure has related to significant purchases of materials for manufacture of its series m product line which were denominated in yen 
in order to reduce the potential volatility related to its ongoing yen liability  the company has occasionally purchased foreign currencies and held them during the contract term 
at december  the company did not hold a hedge position against a foreign currency exposure 
during the year ended december   the average exchange rate for purchases denominated in yen improved to yen to the dollar from yen to the dollar for the year ended december   generating a reduction in cost of goods sold of over  assuming a similar volume of purchases denominated in yen  and that the company does not enter into a hedge in order to minimize volatility of its yen liability for that period  a return to average exchange rates for purchases of yen to the dollar or lower could increase cost of goods sold by  or more 
at december  the company had purchase commitments denominated in yen of  should there be a change in average exchange rates to from the average of yen to the dollar  the cost of those purchases would increase approximately  there can be no assurance that the exchange rate will not fall below yen to the dollar and thus that the company will not experience an even higher increase in the cost of goods sold if it has not elected to hedge prior to that time 
the company does maintain cash balances denominated in british pound sterling  irish punt  french francs  and german deutschemarks 
if foreign exchanges rates were to weaken against the dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at december   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
