item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since  we have transitioned to primarily leasing portable storage units from primarily selling them 
this has caused the composition of our revenues and expenses to change 
leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased to in from in and in from the end of to the end of  we increased the number of portable storage units in our lease fleet from  to  this is an average annual growth rate in units of approximately 
our leasing revenues include all rent we receive for our portable storage units 
our sales revenues include sales of portable storage units and other structures to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the portable storage units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales includes both our cost to buy  refurbish and modify used iso shipping containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate overhead for both our leasing and sales activities 
typically  annual repairs and maintenance expenses on our leased units have averaged approximately of lease revenues 
we expense our repair and maintenance costs as incurred  and we include them in leasing  selling and general expenses 
our portable storage units are depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life of years  with salvage values estimated at of our original cost 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of operations 
you should read this table and the discussions below with our financial statements 
year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses depreciation and amortization restructuring charge income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense income before provision for income taxes and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income compared to total revenues in increased by to million from million in leasing revenues in increased by to million from million in these increases resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease and a increase in the average rent per unit 
we added three branches in by acquisition in las vegas  oklahoma city and denver 
these three new branches generated an increase in units leased of in and accounted for of our increase in leasing revenues 
the branches that we opened before accounted for of our increase in leasing revenues and albuquerque  our start up location  contributed 
our revenues from the sale of units decreased by to million in from million in this reflects our focus on leasing rather than selling portable storage units 
this decrease was also caused by our decision in to curtail the sale of telecommunication shelters and discontinue our dealer program 
cost of sales decreased to of sales revenues in from of sales revenues in during  we paid less for both used iso shipping containers and the steel we use to manufacture portable storage units 
we also produced more portable storage units at our manufacturing plant in than in these factors caused the higher gross margin on portable storage unit sales in as a percentage of revenues  leasing  selling and general expenses increased to million in from million or in we had higher leasing related expenses because of the increase in the number of units on lease  higher commissions because of our higher leasing volume and million of expenses associated with the three branches we acquired and the one branch we started in these expenses totaled of our leasing revenues in both acquired and start up branches initially have lower profit margins until the branches fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  to of total revenues in from in this increase resulted from our larger lease fleet  additional equipment needed for manufacturing and maintaining the lease fleet and other equipment added at our branches 
our operating margin increased to in from in principally because we focused on leasing rather than selling our portable storage units and because leasing  selling and general expenses decreased as a percent of leasing revenues 
as a result  income from operations increased by to million in from million in interest expense increased by to million in from million in as a result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by  consisting of million of senior subordinated notes issued in october and an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we used this debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet 
the weighted average interest rate declined to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
including amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in we reported net income in of million  or per diluted share of common stock  compared to net income in of million  or per diluted share of common stock 
these increases were primarily because of our higher leasing revenues in and the decrease in leasing  selling and general expenses per unit on lease in our effective tax rate was for both and we had a increase in the weighted average number of common and common share equivalents outstanding in because of exercise of warrants we had issued in and common stock issued in connection with the acquisitions 
compared to total revenues in increased by to million from million in leasing revenues in increased to million from million in these increases resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease and an increase of million from our loss limitation waiver program which we introduced in our sales revenues from the sale of portable storage units and other structures decreased by because we began focusing on leasing rather than selling and because we discontinued selling modular buildings 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in revenues from the sale of telecommunication shelters 
during  we implemented price increases on the portable storage units we sell 
this and our discontinuation of selling low margin modular buildings caused a substantial increase in our gross margin on sales during as a result  cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to during from during leasing  selling and general expenses increased by to million in from million in we attribute this increase to higher leasing related expenses because we had more units on lease  higher commissions because of our higher leasing volume and increased expenses to develop the infrastructure we needed for our planned future growth 
these expenses totaled of our leasing revenues in  compared to in depreciation and amortization expenses increased by  to of total revenues in from in this increase resulted from our larger lease fleet  additional equipment needed for manufacturing and maintaining the lease fleet and other equipment added at our branches 
we recorded a restructuring charge in of  because we discontinued manufacturing modular buildings 
there was no similar charge in our operating margin increased to in from in principally because we focused on leasing rather than selling portable storage units and because we substantially improved our gross margin on sales of units 
income from operations increased by to million in from million in interest expense increased by to million in from million in as a result of our higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by and consisted of million of senior subordinated notes issued in october and an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we used this debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet 
the weighted average interest rate declined to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
including amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in in  we prepaid approximately million of debt and capital lease obligations at the time we entered into our credit facility 
as a result  we recognized an extraordinary charge to earnings in of  or per common share  net of the benefit of income taxes 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share of common stock  compared to net income before extraordinary item of  or per diluted share of common stock 
these increases were primarily because of the increase in leasing revenues in and the higher gross margin on sales of units in our effective tax rate was reduced to in from in excluding the restructuring charge  earnings before extraordinary item would have been  or per diluted share of common stock 
liquidity and capital resources our leasing and manufacturing businesses are very capital intensive 
we have financed our working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from equity and debt financings and borrowings under our credit facility 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in  million in and million in this increasing cash flow resulted primarily from our higher net income  increased depreciation expense and deferred income taxes 
the growth of our business  however  required us to use more cash to support higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in this increasing use of cash resulted primarily from higher levels of capital expenditures for lease fleet expansion and acquisitions 
capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in in addition  we spent million in for acquisitions 
no acquisitions were completed in or financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the majority of warrants exercised were issued in connection with our initial public offering in during  the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of proceeds from the issuance of senior subordinated notes with detachable redeemable warrants 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of proceeds from the issuance of notes 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the agreement effective in september  under which the company is designated as the fixed rate payer at an interest rate of per annum 
under the agreement  the company has effectively fixed  for a three year period  the interest rate payable on million of its revolving line of credit so that the rate is based upon a spread from  rather than a spread from the eurodollar rate 
since march  our principal source of liquidity has been our credit facility  which consists of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the interest rate under our credit facility is determined quarterly  based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
during  the average interest rate under our credit facility was 
as of march   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  and million of additional borrowings were available 
the amount we can borrow under the revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility is based upon the level of our inventories  accounts receivable and the value of our lease fleet 
the lease fleet is appraised at least annually for purposes of the credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  including all of our portable storage units 
the credit facility includes a term loan due in march the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of million at december  we must make principal and interest payments monthly on the term loan 
in october  we issued million of senior subordinated notes with detachable redeemable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
these notes are due november  but may be prepaid after november  without a prepayment penalty 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of these notes to repay million in bridge notes issued in july and to reduce borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
because the notes were sold with redeemable warrants  a portion of the sale price was allocated to the notes and a portion to the redeemable warrants  based on their respective fair market values 
the resulting discount increases the effective interest rate on the notes  and we are amortizing it as interest expense over the life of the notes 
we believe that our working capital  together with our cash flow from operations  borrowing under our credit facility and other available funding sources will be sufficient to fund our operations and controlled growth for the next months 
we believe that in order to maintain historical growth rates we will be required to obtain additional debt financing and to raise additional equity capital by issuing additional shares of our stock 
however  we cannot assure that we can obtain the necessary debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
seasonality although demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal  our operations as a whole has not been very seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units is stronger from september through december because retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return leased units to us early in the following year 
this has caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarters of the past several years 
year compliance and expenditures we recognize the problems associated with year transactions and have evaluated our computer hardware and software systems for potential year compliance issues relating to internal operating systems  suppliers and customers and third party services that we rely on in our daily operations 
internal operating systems 
we have completed our assessment of our major internal operating systems 
we installed a new software system in which has been certified by the vendor to be fully year compliant 
we continue to test this software  and all our other software and hardware  for compliance 
we believe our major internal operating systems are year compliant and we will test any new modular software packages added to our primary operating system 
we expect our assessment of internal operating systems to be fully complete in the second quarter of the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software  conversions to new software and replacement of some hardware  the year issue will be satisfactorily resolved in its own internal operating systems by the third quarter of the company has established an internal auditing process to track and verify the results of its plan and tests 
suppliers and customers 
we are currently evaluating the year readiness of our material vendors and suppliers 
we have forwarded questionnaires to all of our major suppliers and will evaluate responses on a case by case basis 
we are placing the emphasis of this review on our primary vendors  such as steel  paint and other suppliers and the phone systems 
in the event that our suppliers are not year compliant in a timely manner  we could experience a shortage in material supplies and  as a result  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we also sent questionnaires to our larger leasing customers for the year issue 
if the majority of our corporate customers are not year compliant in a timely manner  customer lease payments to us could be delayed and our cash flow would be affected 
we have not yet received sufficient information from suppliers and customers about their year compliance and remediation plans to predict the outcome of their efforts 
third party services 
we have contacted our outside service providers  including banks  invoice processors and payroll processors and discussed their assessment of their year readiness 
we have been advised by the agent under the credit facility that the year is not expected to cause delays or other problems in connection with our transactions under that facility 
we have not yet received sufficient information from other third party servicers about their year compliance and remediation plans to predict the outcome of their efforts 
where we are dependent on third party service providers  if they are not year compliant in a timely manner our operations could be disrupted and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are developing a contingency plan that is expected to address financial and operational problems that might arise on and around january  this contingency plan would include identifying back up processes that do not rely on computers whenever possible 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses allocable to internal staff  as well as costs for computer systems remediation and replacement in order to achieve year compliance 
we currently estimate that these costs will total approximately  we have incurred relatively low costs to date primarily due to the new software system implemented in that is year compliant 
the costs of the year program and the date on which we plan to be completely year compliant are based on current estimates  which reflect numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  the timing and effectiveness of third party remediation plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from our plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct relevant computer source codes and embedded technology  the results of internal and external testing and the timelessness and the effectiveness of remediation efforts of third parties 
if the modifications and conversions referred to above are not made or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
moreover  even if these changes are successful  failure of third parties to which we are financially or operationally linked to address their own system problems could have a material adverse effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates by entering into financial arrangements intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
an interest rate swap agreement is the only instrument used by the company to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting the company s variable rate debt 
the company currently has one outstanding interest rate swap agreement under which the company pays a fixed rate and receives a variable interest rate 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of the company s debt portfolio total fair at december  total at value at december  december  thereafter liabilities fixed rate in s      average interest rate floating rate in s      average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed in s    average pay rate average receive rate mo libor bba the company enters into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that it meets the objectives described above  and the company does not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s credit facility matures in  including a one year option 
these variable rate liabilities will continue to increase due to future growth until maturity 
see note line of credit in the notes to financial statements incorporated herein by reference for further description of the variable rate liability 
management intends to renew or replace the line of credit with similar arrangements or debt prior to maturity  on terms as reasonably favorable to their existing terms 
the company however  cannot be certain that such financing will be available or on terms acceptable to the company
