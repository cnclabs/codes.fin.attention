the improvement of results from certain of the acquired businesses having lower selling expenses than the company s other product lines  and the realization of reduced administrative expenses from integration of certain operations of the acquired businesses within the company s existing infrastructure 
not all of the administrative functions of the businesses acquired during fiscal have as yet been integrated 
it is expected that the integration process may not be completed until the end of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company aggressively started to promote awareness of its newly acquired brands and products in an effort to expand product distribution into existing and new market channels and territories 
prior to their acquisition by the company  these brands and certain market channels were not aggressively promoted 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting costs of start up activities sop 
sop is effective beginning on july   and requires the start up costs capitalized prior to such date be written off as a cumulative effect of an accounting change as of july  any future start up costs are to be expensed as incurred 
start up activities are broadly defined as those one time activities related to introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer or commencing some new operation 
had sop been adopted at the beginning of the years ended june  and  selling  general and administrative expenses would have increased million and million respectively 
without consideration to the one time accounting change  operating results subsequent to fiscal year are not expected to be materially affected by the adoption of sop the company plans to continue to invest in consumer spending and to enhance brand equity while closely monitoring its trade spending 
these spending categories include  but are not limited to  consumer advertising using radio and print  coupons  direct mailing programs  and other forms of promotions 
there is no guarantee that these investments will be successful  and as the company attempts to reduce its trade spending and increase consumer awareness  there may be a period of overlap

interest and financing costs for amounted to million  an increase of million over the period 
the increase was due to the debt incurred in connection with the fiscal year acquisitions  partially offset by reduced interest costs resulting from the prepayment in april of the company s then subordinated debentures 
the debentures were retired with the proceeds of senior debt carrying an interest rate of approximately 
income before income taxes for increased to million of net sales from million of net sales in this significant improvement in profitability was attributable to the aforementioned increase in sales  lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  offset by higher depreciation  amortization and interest expenses  as a percentage of sales 
income taxes increased to million in compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared with in of the increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the higher federal statutory rate resulting from the company s higher level of income  with a increase in the amortization of nondeductible goodwill arising from current year acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisition of nng on may  referred to above  and other mitigating factors  the company anticipates that its effective income tax rate in fiscal year ending june  will be approximately 
net income for increased by million over and amounted to of net sales  compared with in the period 
the increase was a result of a higher level of operating income discussed above offset by higher interest costs and higher effective tax rates 
in addition  in the company recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of tax benefit  resulting from the aforementioned prepayment of its subordinated debentures in april fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for increased by approximately million to million as compared with million in sales of westbrae accounted for a substantial portion of the increase 
gross profit for increased by approximately million to million of sales as compared to million of sales in the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable largely to the increased sales level in the increase in the gross margin percentage was attributable principally to a reduction in warehousing and delivery costs as a percentage of sales and the effect of the westbrae acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million of sales in as compared with million of sales in substantially all of the dollar increase was attributable to the acquisition of westbrae 
the reduction in such costs as a percentage of sales was attributable principally to higher sales levels which have the impact of better absorption of general operating costs 
depreciation and amortization costs increased to million in from million in the principal factor contributing to in the increase was amortization of goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of westbrae and the other businesses during the past three fiscal years 
interest and financing costs for amounted to million in as compared with million in in october  the company acquired westbrae principally with the proceeds of bank borrowings 
in december  the company issued million shares of common stock in a public offering  the proceeds of which were used to pay down a substantial portion of the debt incurred in connection with the westbrae acquisition 
accordingly  between october  and december  there was a higher level of debt which accounted for most of the increase in interest expense 
in april  the company prepaid million of its subordinated debentures with the proceeds of less costly bank borrowings 
this prepayment will result in lower interest costs subsequent to the prepayment 
income before income taxes and extraordinary charge for increased to million of sales from million of sales in this significant improvement in profitability was attributable to the aforementioned increase in sales  the improvement in gross profit margins  lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales  offset by the increase in amortization of goodwill and interest costs

this resulted in an extraordinary charge of approximately million before related income tax benefits of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires liquidity for working capital needs and debt service requirements 
the company had working capital of million at june  as compared to million at june  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to the cash flows provided by the company s operations of million offset by higher current principal debt service requirements for fiscal by million when compared to the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at the end of compared with at the end of the decrease in the current ratio is due to the aforementioned current debt service requirements for fiscal  higher current liabilities assumed in the nng merger offset in part by higher inventory and trade receivable levels 
although trade receivables are higher  day sales outstanding improved from in to in the improvement is a result of certain acquired businesses having days sales outstanding lower than the company s historical levels and improved credit and collection efforts 
the increase in inventories  which were financed by the company s operating cash flows in  are due to the slightly deteriorated inventory turnover rates from in to in the company expects to improve inventory turnovers from efficiencies obtained through integration efforts within operations and production scheduling methods 
cash flows provided by operations for the year ended june  was million compared to 
million for the year ended june  the primary reason for this increase is million of higher net income in compared to on july   in connection with the acquisitions of businesses from the shansby group and other investors  the company and its bank entered into a million amended and restated credit facility facility providing for a million senior term loan and a million revolving credit line 
the entire senior term loan was borrowed on that date to pay the cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions  fund closing costs  repay debt of the acquired businesses  and to repay the then existing balance million on the facility 
on may   in connection with the acquisition of nng  the company arranged for a million senior secured loan facility amended facility  which provided for a million credit facility and million of term loans 
this amended facility was used to complete the acquisition of nng  refinance the company s then existing indebtedness  which included million outstanding on the above mentioned million term loan  and provide for ongoing working capital needs 
under the amended facility  the term loans consist of a million tranche i loan and a million tranche ii loan 
the interest rate on the amended facility is based partially on the ratio of outstanding debt to operating cash flow as defined 
the company may elect to pay interest based on the bank s base rate or the libor rate 
borrowings on a base rate basis may range from below the bank s base rate to above the bank s base rate 
borrowings on a libor basis may range from to over the libor rate 
the amended facility term loans were borrowed on a libor basis during fiscal the tranche i loan requires principal quarterly installments starting september  through june  the tranche ii loan has similar repayment features  but matures june  amounts outstanding under the amended facility are collateralized by principally all of the company s assets 
the amended facility also contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants 
the company was in compliance with such covenants at june  as of august   million was available under the company s revolving credit line 
utilization of the revolving credit line varies over the course of the year based on inventory requirements and other business transactions 
the aggregate principal payments on the amended facility for the year ending june  are million 
the company believes that projected cash flows generated from its operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility should be sufficient to fund its debt service requirements  working capital needs  anticipated capital expenditures and other operating expenses for the foreseeable future 
the revolving credit facility provides the company with available borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of million 
the company s term loans impose certain restrictions on the company regarding capital expenditures  limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  dispose of assets  make repayments of indebtedness or amendments of debt instruments  pay distributions  create liens on assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  investments  loans or advances and acquisitions 
such restrictions could limit the company s ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business or acquisition opportunities
