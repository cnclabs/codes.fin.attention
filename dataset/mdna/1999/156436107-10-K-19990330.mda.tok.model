changes in interest income and interest expense can result from changes in both volume and rate 
the company has an asset and liability management policy designed to provide a proper balance between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  to attempt to maximize interest margins and to provide adequate liquidity for anticipated needs

the provision for credit losses was  in  compared with  for  increasing  or 
the increase was largely the result of a increase in loans  net of unearned income to million at december  from million at year end net charge offs increased to  in  from  in  the result of a  increase in charge offs in the commercial loan portfolios accompanied by reduced charge offs in other loan categories 
the provision for credit losses was  for  compared with  for  increasing  or

in addition  net charge offs increased to  for  from  in  primarily the result of a  increase in net charge offs in the installment and credit card loan portfolios 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in view of the company s plans to continue its loan growth with increased emphasis on commercial loans which are generally considered to be more risky than loans secured by real estate  it is likely that the company will continue to maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses through future provisions charged to income 
management will continue to closely monitor the performance of the loan portfolio and make additional provisions as considered necessary 
no assurance can be given that such provisions will not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in future periods 
noninterest income noninterest income for was  an increase of  or compared with noninterest income of  in this increase resulted largely from growth of the credit card program  increases in service charges on deposit accounts  as well as commissions and other fee income 
noninterest income in also included gains from the sale of investment securities  and the liquidation of other real estate owned 
noninterest income was  for  compared with  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily the result of increased fee income from the company s mastercard visa credit card program  which increased  or in in addition  commission and other fee income increased  or  due to increased atm transactions and other miscellaneous fee income in the following table sets forth the various categories of  and changes in  noninterest income for the years ended december   and noninterest income dollars in thousands year ended december  change change service charges on deposit accounts credit card and merchant fees commission and other fee income other income total noninterest income  noninterest expense noninterest expense was  in  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in was attributable to increased occupancy and equipment expenses of  professional fees of  data processing services of  and other operating expenses of  these increases were primarily attributable to the opening of three new branch offices in maryland and virginia in and  the corresponding growth in the loan portfolio  and efforts to prepare for and comply with year readiness issues 
noninterest expense was  for  compared with  for  representing an increase of  or 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to increased personnel and occupancy related expenses associated with the addition of two new branches in virginia in  and other increased expenses from the establishment of the company s lpo in maryland 
the company s noninterest expense has been consistently higher in relation to its asset size than the average for small community banks 
the company s strategy is to increase its asset size significantly so that its level of noninterest expense in relation to its assets is more in line with those of comparable institutions 
no assurance may be given  however  that the anticipated asset growth or branch expansions will occur 
the following table sets forth the various categories of  and changes in  noninterest expense for the years ended december   and noninterest expense dollars in thousands year ended december  change change salaries and employee benefits    professional fees occupancy and equipment expense depreciation and amortization data processing communications office and operations expenses marketing and public relations federal deposit insurance premiums other real estate owned other expenses total noninterest expense    income tax expense the company s income tax expense includes federal  state and local income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was thousand in compared to thousand in and thousand in this reflects effective tax rates of percent in  percent in  and percent in the higher effective rate in was primarily due to nondeductible expenses of  incurred in connection with the registration of shares of the company s common stock  as well as other nondeductible expenses 
the effective tax rate has been further reduced in due to the increase in interest income derived from us agency securities which are not fully taxable for state and local purposes  and a greater portion of earnings derived from virginia and maryland where the local income tax rates are lower than in washington  dc 
interest rate sensitivity and management of market risk net interest income  which constitutes one of the principal sources of income for the company  represents the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the difference between the company s interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities for a specified time frame is referred to as an interest sensitive gap 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income of a movement in interest rates 
a financial institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a financial institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets 
during a period of rising falling interest rates  a positive gap would tend to increase decrease net interest income  while a negative gap would tend to decrease increase net interest income 
management seeks to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position to protect its net interest margin from market fluctuations 
toward this end  the company maintains an asset liability committee alco which reviews  on a regular basis  the maturity and repricing of the assets and liabilities of the company 
alco has adopted the objective of achieving and maintaining a one year cumulative gap  as a percent of total assets  of between plus and minus 
on a consolidated basis  the company s one year cumulative gap was a negative of total assets at december  in addition  alco monitors potential changes in net interest income  net income and the market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  arising primarily from interest rate risk in the company s loan and investment portfolios  which can significantly impact the company s profitability 
net interest income can be adversely impacted where assets and liabilities do not react the same to changes in interest rates 
at year end  the impact of an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points and basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income over a month period of and  respectively  with a comparable decrease in interest rates resulting in an increase in net interest income of and 
management finds the above methodologies meaningful for evaluating market risk sensitivity  however  other factors can affect net interest income  such as levels of non earning assets and changes in portfolio composition

as of december  and  approximately million percent and million percent of the company s total loan portfolio  respectively  consisted of loans secured by real estate  of which one to four family residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit represented million percent and million percent  respectively  of the company s total loan portfolio 
loan concentrations are defined as aggregate credits extended to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or resident in the same geographic region  which would cause them to be similarly affected by economic or other conditions 
the company  on a routine basis  evaluates these concentrations for purposes of policing its concentrations and making necessary adjustments in its lending practices to reflect current economic conditions  loan to deposit ratios  and industry trends 
as a result of the company s existing branch locations  the company has significant concentrations of customers and assets in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
the primary types of loans in the company s portfolio are residential mortgages and home equity loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and consumer installment and credit card loans 
generally  the company underwrites loans based upon the borrower s debt service capacity or cash flow  a consideration of past performance on loans from other creditors as well as an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan 
with some exceptions  the company s general policy is to require conservative underwriting policies  primarily in the analysis of borrowers debt service coverage capabilities for commercial and commercial real estate loans  while emphasizing lower gross debt ratios for consumer loans and lower loan to value ratios for all types of real estate loans 
most of the company s commercial real estate loans consist of owner occupied properties financed for the company s regular commercial customers  rather than speculative or investor owned properties 
most of the company s commercial and commercial real estate loans are personally guaranteed by the owners of the business  the primary exceptions to this requirement being loans to non profit and membership organizations 
given the localized nature of the company s lending activities  the primary risk factor affecting the portfolio as a whole is the health of the local economy in the washington metropolitan area and its effects on the value of local real estate and the incomes of local professionals and business firms 
to mitigate this risk  the company s underwriting policy provides that each loan should be supported by an economically independent secondary source of repayment 
any exceptions to the general loan policy must be approved by the executive loan committee 
loans to directors  executive officers and principal stockholders of the company and to directors and officers of the bank are subject to limitations contained in the federal reserve act  the principal effect of which is to require that extensions of credit by the bank to executive officers  directors  and ten percent stockholders satisfy certain standards 
the bank routinely makes loans in the ordinary course of business to certain directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates  and members of their immediate families 
in accordance with federal reserve act guidelines  these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable transactions with others and do not involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features 
as of december   loans and commitments outstanding to directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates and members of their immediate families totaled million net of participations sold to other banks on a non recourse basis  which represented approximately percent of total loans as of that date 
as of december   none of these loans outstanding from the bank to related parties were on non accrual  past due  restructured or considered by management to be a potential problem loan

the company s portfolio of adjustable rate home mortgages consists of loans to customers in the local market area 
such loans generally have balloon maturities within ten years or less  with two percent annual and six percent lifetime caps on interest rate changes 
borrowers have the right to prepay such loans without penalty

asset quality nonperforming assets generally  interest on loans is accrued and credited to income based upon the principal balance outstanding 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify a loan as non accrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection  or when  in the opinion of management  principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation 
the company will generally charge off loans after days of delinquency unless adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  management believes that the loan will be repaid or brought current within a reasonable period of time 
loans will not be returned to accrual status until the loan has been brought current and future payments of principal and interest appear certain 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance until the status of the loan has changed 
real estate acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned oreo 
such loans are reclassified to oreo and recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value less estimated selling costs  and the estimated loss  if any  is charged to the allowance for credit losses at that time 
further allowances for losses are recorded as charges to other expenses at the time management believes additional deterioration in value has occurred

the second is a borrowing relationship which has gone through internal reorganization of company principals 
there is one major loan secured by the owner occupied mortgage on a medical practice as well as other assets 
the company expects this relationship to return to accrual status in march of once consistent payment performance is achieved 
no material losses are anticipated for the company on these two loans 
the last relationship is comprised of a real estate secured loan which was on accrual at or more days past due 
the company has significant real property collateral at acceptable margins and has maintained a good working relationship with the borrower 
interest lost on these nonaccrual loans was approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
the company did not receive any interest paid on these nonaccrual loans in and received approximately  and  for and  respectively 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses based upon  among other things  such factors as historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the company  the amount of nonperforming assets  regulatory policies  generally accepted accounting principles  general economic conditions  and other factors related to the collectibility of loans in the company s portfolio 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses  future adjustments may be necessary if such factors and conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
based upon criteria consistently applied during the periods  the company s allowance for credit losses was  of total loans as of december    of total loans as of december   and  of total loans as of december  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was  and as of december   and  respectively

in considering the loss potential associated with different types of loans  the company considers its own historical loss experience with each type of loan  together with any internal or external changes which might suggest that future losses will be higher or lower than the historical loss experience 
such additional factors include changes in national or local economic conditions which affect the repayment capacity of borrowers and or the market value of collateral  trends in past due payments  changes in underwriting standards  changes in loan originating and servicing personnel  changes in the types of credit offered  and other factors

year the year problem arose because many computer programs were designed to use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs did not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the extent of the potential impact of the year problem is not yet known  however  the consequences of the year problem could have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
in december  the company adopted a year compliance plan yk plan for the assessment of its exposure to the year problem  completion of any required remediation  and testing of systems compliance 
a specific timetable was established  and a senior officer of the company was assigned leadership responsibility

the company believes that it is presently on schedule with respect to its yk plan  and outside reviews to date found the company s year compliance efforts to be satisfactory 
as of december   the company s estimated percentage of completion of its yk plan was  and the estimated date for completion was august  testing of mission critical systems was completed in november testing methodology included copying the entire customer data base onto a year compliant hardware and software computer system  and utilizing the key year dates defined by the ffiec to test date sensitive transactions and calculations 
these tests were performed on all mission critical systems and results revealed compliance or very minor discrepancies which have been traced 
failed test transactions will be tested again in material third party risks principally include assessing the year preparation status of bank borrowing customers 
the company completed an assessment of year risk within its loan portfolio as of the september   regulatory target date  and will continue to monitor the progress of any borrowers deemed to be at high risk 
as part of its yk plan  the company expects to spend approximately  for the replacement of outdated computer hardware and software 
much of these expenditures would have been incurred in the ordinary course of business to maintain such computer systems  regardless of year problem considerations 
the human resources requirement will include the time of regular company employees  a network administration consultant  and approximately  of additional consulting expenses 
no significant computer systems projects have been delayed as a result of year preparations 
because most of the company s data processing services are provided by outside vendors on a contract basis  management does not currently anticipate that the costs to address the company s year issues will have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company believes that the most likely worst case scenarios due to the year problem could include liquidity issues due to customers withdrawal of extra cash  security preparations  or short term electric power interruptions 
the company is taking steps to establish and renew lines of credit with its correspondent banks and the federal home loan bank of atlanta to assure that adequate liquidity will be available to meet the needs of customers 
additional security precautions will be taken to prevent possible crimes due to heightened public awareness of additional cash reserves 
the company does not believe that long term and widespread electric power outages are likely  and has planned to address short term interruptions by training bank management and staff to be ready to provide limited service to customers 
the company is dependent upon the services of eds in reston  virginia  to provide access to customer data bases and other mission critical functions 
eds has back up service sites available and ready to provide services to the company should electric power interruptions or other problems occur in the reston location 
the company does not expect any significant loss in revenue to occur as a result of year problems 
the company s yk plan includes certain contingency plans to be implemented in the event that computer systems fail to perform in accordance with plans and expectations 
for the most part  these contingency plans involve a change to manual processes for all mission critical business functions  which the company believes is practical in view of the relative size and scope of its operations 
management and staff will be trained on these procedures and processes prior to july  and additional refresher training will be provided during november and december impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks  and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the company and its results of operations are not predictable
