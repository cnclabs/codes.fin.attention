item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction tricon global restaurants  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as tricon  the company  we or our became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements 
tricon is comprised of the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut and taco bell the core business es 
the spin off marked our beginning as a company focused solely on the restaurant business and our three well recognized brands  which together have more retail units worldwide than any other single quick service restaurant qsr company 
separately  each brand ranks in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units 
our  plus international units make us the second largest qsr company outside the united states 
this management s discussion and analysis md a is structured in five major sections 
the first section provides an overview and focuses on items that either significantly impact historical comparability or are anticipated to significantly impact our future operating results 
the second analyzes our consolidated  us and international results of operations 
the next two sections address our consolidated cash flows and financial condition 
finally  there is a discussion of certain market risks and our cautionary statements 
for purposes of this md a  we include the worldwide operations of our core businesses and  through their respective dates of disposal in  our us non core businesses 
these non core businesses consist of california pizza kitchen  chevys mexican restaurant  d angelo s sandwich shops  east side mario s and hot n now collectively the non core businesses 
where significant to the discussion  we separately identify the impact of the non core businesses 
in our discussion volume is the estimated dollar effect of the year over year change in customer transaction counts 
effective net pricing includes price increases decreases and the effect of changes in product mix 
portfolio effect represents the impact on operating results related to our refranchising initiative and closure of underperforming stores 
system sales represents our core businesses combined sales of the company  joint venture  franchised and licensed units 
where actual sales data is not reported  our franchised and licensed unit sales are estimated 
nm in any table indicates that the percentage is not considered meaningful 
b w in any table means better worse 
in addition  throughout our discussion  we use the terms restaurants  units and stores interchangeably 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages and the cautionary statements on page tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as specifically identified 
international operations in  our international business accounted for of system sales  of total revenues and of operating profit before unallocated and corporate expenses  foreign exchange gains  facility actions and unusual charges 
we anticipate that  despite the inherent risks and generally higher general and administrative expenses of operations  we will continue to invest in key international markets with substantial growth potential 
during  recognizing that two thirds of our international profits were coming from seven countries  we decided to substantially reduce our number of primary equity markets from to our ultimate goal of about ten markets 
by the end of  we expect to have only about primary equity markets outside the us given the significance of our international operations  it is important to consider that movements in currency exchange rates not only result in a related translation impact on our earnings  but also can result in significant economic impacts that affect operating results 
changes in exchange rates are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors which may change consumer behavior and may impact our operating results 
in addition  material changes may cause us to adjust our financing  investing and operating strategies  for example  promotions and product strategies  pricing and decisions concerning capital spending  sourcing of raw materials and packaging see discussion on asia below 
the following paragraphs describe the effect of currency exchange rate movements on our reported results 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we identify material effects on comparability of sales and operating profit arising from translation of operating results in the md a 
by definition  these translation effects exclude the impact of businesses in highly inflationary countries  where the accounting functional currency is the us dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates can also result in reported foreign exchange gains and losses  which are included as a component of our general  administrative and other expenses 
we reported a net foreign exchange gain of million in  compared to losses of million in and million in these reported amounts include transaction and translation gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets such as receivables and short term interest bearing investments as well as payables including debt denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
translation gains and losses arise from remeasurement of the monetary assets and liabilities of our businesses in highly inflationary countries into us dollars 
asian economic events the overall economic turmoil and weakening of local currencies against the us dollar which began in late throughout much of asia presented a challenging retail environment during the difficult economic conditions adversely affected the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and profits translation and reduced consumer demand as seen in reduced transaction counts  both of which impacted our consolidated results of operations 
asian operations in such countries as china  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan and thailand  among others  comprised approximately of our international us dollar translated system sales in  versus for asian system sales declined million or in excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asian system sales increased in system sales increases in china and taiwan were partially offset by declines in japan  korea and south asia 
our company revenues from asia declined million or in included in our revenues are franchise fees  which decreased million  or 
excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation  our revenues from asia increased approximately in new unit development in china  taiwan and korea led the increase  partially offset by volume declines in korea  china and thailand 
our operating profits from asia declined million or in excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  operating profits decreased in lower margins in korea and volume declines in both korea and china were partially offset by new unit growth as well as increased store margins in china and taiwan 
the discussion above reflects a change in the methodology we have used in to calculate the foreign currency translation effect attributed to asia s system sales  revenues and operating profits in previous md as 
we believe this revised methodology  which is consistent with the method we have historically used for total international  is preferable because it results in analytical relationships that are more consistent with our local currency operating results in asia 
under the revised method  the decline in operating profits attributed to the effect of foreign currency translation is million less than previously disclosed 
selected highlights of our recent operating results in asia are as follows b w vs 
system sales   of international system sales revenues of international revenues operating profit a of total international operating profit a a excludes facility actions net gain loss  unusual charges and foreign exchange gains losses 
in  we will continue to work with our suppliers to reduce food costs and focus on increasing our everyday value offerings  and we expect to continue to cautiously seek out investment opportunities in asia  drawing on lessons learned there  and from our experience in other countries which have faced similar problems in the past such as mexico and poland 
the complexities of the international environment in which we operate make it difficult to accurately predict the ongoing effect of currency movements 
actual effects will be reported in our financial statements as they become known 
however  we currently expect our sales and operating profits in asia will improve in aided by the reduction of certain regional support costs and more stable sales trends 
year we have established an enterprise wide plan to prepare our information technology systems it and non information technology systems with embedded technology applications et for the year issue  to reasonably assure that our critical business partners are prepared and to plan for business continuity as we enter the coming millennium 
our plan encompasses the use of both internal and external resources to identify  correct and test systems for year readiness 
external resources include nationally recognized consulting firms and other contract resources to supplement available internal resources 
the phases of our plan awareness  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation are currently expected to cost to million from through completion in the new estimate is higher than our original estimate of to million 
our original estimate did not include approximately million in costs related to the accelerated implementation of replacement systems 
additionally  we have increased our estimates for the approximate costs of remediating subsequently identified applications and the greater than anticipated complexity of certain remediation and contingency planning activities 
our plan contemplates our own it et as well as assessment and contingency planning relative to year business risks inherent in our material third party relationships 
the total cost represents less than of our total estimated information technology related expenses over the plan period 
we have incurred approximately million from inception of planned actions through december  of which million was incurred during we expect to incur approximately million in with some additional problem resolution spending in all costs related to our year plan are expected to be funded through cash flow from operations 
a 
it et state of readiness we have now completed our inventory process of hardware including desktops  software third party and internally developed and embedded technology applications 
completion of the inventory process significantly increased the previously reported tabulations of applications  as defined below  as more complete counts  primarily regarding desktop  hardware and et were obtained 
we have also implemented monitoring procedures designed to insure that new it et investment is year compliant 
based on this inventory  we identified the critical it et applications and are in the process of determining the year compliance status of the it et through third party vendor inquiry or internal processes 
we expect to be substantially complete with the conversion which includes replacement and remediation and unit testing of the majority of critical us systems in the second quarter of although our original timeline has been extended for approximately ten critical applications  we now expect to be able to convert  consolidate  or replace all such applications by late summer 
this timetable reflects certain delays attributable to identified incremental complexities of the remediation processes as well as slippage in the execution of our remediation plan 
further delays on these efforts or additional slippage could be detrimental to our overall state of readiness 
our international it et efforts  as expected  have continued to lag behind our us efforts 
however  we believe our business risk is minimized by the predominant use of unmodified third party it in our international business for which year compliant versions already exist 
current plans call for timely conversion of critical international systems to these compliant versions 
we will continue to closely monitor international progress 
we expect to continue integration testing on remediated  replaced and consolidated us and international systems throughout the following table identifies by category and status the major identified it et applications at december  remediation category compliant in process not compliant third party developed software  internally developed software desktop  hardware  et  other note we based the tabulations on the total inventory of identified applications that was completed at the end of we have defined the term applications as used in this year discussion to describe separately identifiable groups of programs  hardware or et which can be both logically segregated by business purpose and separately unit tested as to performance of a single business function 
we will either replace or retire not compliant applications before year applications have been prioritized and are being remediated based on expected impact of non remediation 
of the remaining in process applications in the internally developed category  which by definition require internal remediation  less than half have been identified as critical 
b 
material third party relationships we believe that our critical third party relationships can be subdivided generally into suppliers  banks  franchisees and other service providers primarily data exchange partners 
we completed an inventory of us and international restaurant suppliers and have mailed letters requesting information regarding their year status 
we are in the process of collecting the responses from the suppliers and assessing their year risks 
of approximately suppliers considered critical  approximately are high risk based on their responses and approximately have not yet responded to inquiries to date 
we expect to continue follow up  but by mid we expect to source through alternate compliant vendors where possible 
we will develop contingency plans in the first half of for us and international suppliers that we believe have substantial year operational risks 
we have sent letters to or obtained other information regarding compliance information from our primary lending and cash management banks relationship banks 
we will develop contingency plans by early for all banks that have not submitted written representation of year readiness 
we have limited the following table to relationship banks as we are currently preparing an inventory of us depository banks and have just completed the inventory of international banks responsible for processing restaurant deposits and disbursements 
we are following the process used for relationship banks to evaluate the year risks for the us depository and international banks 
we have approximately  us and international franchisees 
we have sent information to all us and international franchisees regarding the business risks associated with year in addition  we provided sample it et project plans and a report of the compliance status in company owned restaurants to the us franchisees 
in the early part of  we plan to mail letters to all us and international franchisees requesting information regarding their year status 
in the us  we intend to accumulate survey data and an inventory of point of sale hardware and software in use by our franchisees 
we then intend to contact pos vendors to assist the franchise community in determining year compliance 
outside the us  our regional franchise offices will be conducting the franchise survey 
we have identified third party companies that provide critical data exchange services and mailed letters to these companies requesting year status 
we will develop contingency plans for companies that we believe have significant year operational risks 
additionally  we are in the process of identifying all other third party companies that provide business critical services 
we are planning to follow the same process used for the data exchange service providers 
the following table indicates by type of third party risk the status of the readiness process responses received responses not yet received suppliers relationship banks service providers note as we have not yet requested information from our individual franchisees regarding year compliance status  this table contains no information regarding our franchisees 
in addition  we have only included relationship banks due to incomplete data regarding depository and payroll banks 
the forward looking nature and lack of historical precedent for year issues present a difficult disclosure challenge 
only one thing is certain about the impact of year it is difficult to predict with certainty what truly will happen after december  we have based our year costs and timetables on our best current estimates  which we derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  we cannot guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from our plans 
given our best efforts and execution of remediation  replacement and testing  it is still possible that there will be disruptions and unexpected business problems during the early months of we anticipate making diligent  reasonable efforts to assess year readiness of our critical business partners and will ultimately develop contingency plans for business critical systems prior to the end of however  we are heavily dependent on the continued normal operations of not only our key suppliers of chicken  cheese  beef  tortillas and other raw materials and our major food and supplies distributor  but also on other entities such as lending  depository and disbursement banks and third party administrators of our benefit plans 
despite our diligent preparation  unanticipated third party failures  general public infrastructure failures  or our failure to successfully conclude our remediation efforts as planned could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in and beyond 
inability of our franchisees to remit franchise fees on a timely basis or lack of publicly available hard currency or credit card processing capability supporting our retail sales stream could also have material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
fourth quarter charge in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million unusual charge million after tax 
the charge included estimates for costs of closing underperforming stores during  primarily at pizza hut and internationally  reduction to fair market value  less costs to sell  of the carrying amounts of certain restaurants we intended to refranchise in  impairment of certain restaurants intended to be used in the business  impairment of certain joint venture investments to be retained  and costs of related personnel reductions 
of the million charge  approximately million related to asset writedowns and approximately million related to liabilities  primarily occupancy related costs and  to a much lesser extent  severance 
the liabilities were expected to be settled from cash flows provided by operations 
through december   the amounts utilized apply only to the actions covered by the charge 
the charge included provisions related to  units expected to be refranchised or closed 
our prior disclosure of  has been revised to eliminate a duplication in the unit count only of units to be refranchised 
following is a reconciliation of the  units included in the charge to the remaining units at december  total units units expected to be included in closed refranchised the charge units at december   units disposed of units retained change in method of disposal other units at december  although we originally expected to refranchise or close all  units by year end  the disposal of units was delayed 
this was primarily due to longer than expected periods to locate qualified buyers  particularly for international units  extended negotiations with some lessors and execution delays in consolidating the operations of certain units to be closed with other units that will continue to operate 
we expect to dispose of the remaining units during as we indicated in our third quarter form q  we re evaluated during the fourth quarter of our prior estimates of the fair market values of units to be refranchised or closed and re evaluated whether to sell or close certain other units originally expected to be disposed of 
we made these re evaluations based primarily on the improved performance of pizza hut in the us largely as a result of decisions to retain certain stores originally expected to be disposed of  better than expected proceeds from refranchisings and favorable lease settlements on certain closed store leases  we have reversed million of the charge million after tax in these reversals have increased facility actions net gain by million million after tax and decreased unusual charges by million million after tax 
of the million charge  approximately million represented impairment charges for certain restaurants intended to be used in the business and for certain joint venture investments to be retained  which were recorded as reductions of the carrying value of those assets 
below is a summary of the other activity related to the fourth quarter charge through december  asset valuation allowances liabilities total december  utilizations income expense impacts completed transactions decision changes estimate changes other december  we believe that the remaining amounts are adequate to complete our current plan of disposal 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates 
we believe our worldwide business  upon completion of the actions covered by the charge  will be significantly more focused and better positioned to deliver consistent growth in operating profit before facility actions 
we estimate that the favorable impact on operating profit before facility actions related to the fourth quarter charge was approximately million million after tax  including million million after tax from the suspension of depreciation and amortization in for the stores included in the charge 
as anticipated in our annual report on form k  the benefits of our fourth quarter charge of million were largely offset by incremental spending related to our year issues of million and the decline in our asian businesses of million in compared to see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to the components of the fourth quarter charge and to all facility actions 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union emu adopted the euro as a common legal currency and fixed conversion rates were established 
from that date through june   participating countries will maintain both legacy currencies and the euro as legal tender 
beginning january   new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued and a transition period of up to six months will begin in which legacy currencies will be removed from circulation 
we have company owned and franchised businesses in the adopting member countries  which are preparing for the conversion 
expenditures associated with conversion efforts to date have been insignificant 
we currently estimate that our spending over the ensuing three year transition period will be approximately million  related to the conversion in the emu member countries in which we operate stores 
these expenditures primarily relate to capital expenditures for new point of sale and back of house hardware and software 
we expect that adoption of the euro by the uk would significantly increase this estimate due to the size of our businesses there relative to our aggregate businesses in the adopting member countries in which we operate 
the speed of ultimate consumer acceptance of and our competitor s responses to the euro are currently unknown and may impact our existing plans 
however  we know that  from a competitive perspective  we will be required to assess the impacts of product price transparency  potentially revise product bundling strategies and create euro friendly price points prior to we do not believe that these activities will have sustained adverse impacts on our businesses 
although the euro does offer certain benefits to our treasury and procurement activities  these are not currently anticipated to be significant 
we currently anticipate that our suppliers and distributors will continue to invoice us in legacy currencies until late we expect to begin dual pricing in our restaurants in we expect to compensate employees in euros beginning in we believe that the most critical activity regarding the conversion for our businesses is the completion of the rollout of euro ready point of sale equipment and software by the end of our current plans should enable us to be euro compliant prior to the requirements for these activities 
any delays in our ability to complete our plans  or in the ability of our key suppliers to be euro compliant  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial conditions or cash flows 
other factors affecting comparability unusual charges in  we had unusual charges of million million after tax versus unusual charges in of million million after tax 
unusual charges in included the following an increase in the estimated costs of settlement of certain wage and hour litigation and associated defense and other costs incurred  severance and other exit costs related to strategic decisions to streamline the infrastructure of our international businesses  favorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge related to anticipated actions that were not taken  primarily severance  writedown to estimated fair market value less costs to sell of our minority interest in a privately held non core business  previously carried at cost  now held for sale  and reversals of certain valuation allowances and lease liabilities relating to better than expected proceeds from the sale of properties and settlement of lease liabilities associated with properties retained upon the sale of a non core business 
unusual charges in included the following million million after tax of unusual asset impairment and severance charges included in our fourth quarter charge described above  charges to further reduce the carrying amounts of non core businesses held for disposal to estimated market value  less costs to sell  and charges relating to the estimated costs of settlement of certain wage and hour litigation and the associated defense and other costs incurred 
accounting changes in  our financial results will be impacted by a number of accounting changes 
these changes  which we believe are material in the aggregate  fall into three categories o required changes in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  o discretionary methodology changes implemented to more accurately measure certain liabilities and o policy changes driven by our financial standardization project 
following is a discussion of those changes which have affected or will affect comparability 
a 
required changes in gaap in  we will adopt statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement will require us to capitalize approximately million of costs of internal software development and of third party software purchases that we would have expensed previously 
amortization or depreciation of amounts capitalized will be dependent on the useful lives of the underlying software assets 
we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions upon its issuance in march eitf limits the capitalization of internal real estate acquisition costs to those site specific costs incurred from the point in time that the real estate acquisition is probable 
we consider acquisition of the property probable upon final site approval 
eitf resulted in approximately million million after tax of additional expense in the last three quarters of amounts of internal real estate acquisition costs capitalized in will also be further reduced from their levels by a discretionary policy change we have adopted to limit the types of costs eligible for capitalization to those direct costs described as capitalizable in sop the combined incremental impact on results of operations for the application of eitf and the policy change is expected to be approximately million million after tax  almost of which will impact the first quarter 
b 
discretionary methodology changes in  we will refine and enhance our existing actuarial methodology for estimating the self insured portion of our casualty losses 
our current practice is to increase our independent actuary s ultimate loss projections  which have a confidence level  by a consistent percentage to improve the confidence level of our loss estimates 
confidence level means the likelihood that our actual losses will be equal to or below those estimates 
based on our independent actuary s opinion  our current practice produces a very conservative confidence factor at a higher level than our target of 
our actuary believes our change will produce estimates at our target confidence level for each self insured year 
we estimate this change in methodology will increase our results of operations by million million after tax 
the majority of this increase will occur in our first actuarial evaluation which we currently expect to recognize in the first quarter 
accounting for pensions requires us to develop an assumed interest rate on securities with which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this discount rate  we look at rates of return on high quality corporate fixed income securities currently available and expected to be available during the period to the maturity of the pension benefits 
as it is impractical to find an investment portfolio which exactly matches the estimated payment stream of the pension benefits  we often have projected short term cash surpluses 
effective for  we changed our method of determining the pension discount rate to better reflect the assumed investment strategies we would most likely use to invest any short term cash surpluses 
previously  we assumed that all short term cash surpluses would be invested in us government securities 
our new methodology assumes that our investment strategies would be equally divided between us government securities and high quality corporate fixed income securities 
the change in methodology is estimated to favorably impact results of operations by approximately million million after tax 
c 
business standardization changes in  we will begin the standardization of our us people policies  which will require changes by certain of our businesses 
most of these changes are not expected to have a significant financial impact 
as part of this process  our vacation policies will be conformed to a fiscal year based  earn as you go  use or lose policy from policies under which employees vested vacations were attributable to services rendered in prior years 
over the two year implementation period for this vacation policy change  the reduction of our accrued vacation liabilities could be as much as million 
the total reduction and the portion attributable to are not determinable at this time  as final decisions regarding specific transition rules including possible vacation buyouts for some of the affected employee groups have not yet been made 
in addition  in  we will focus on standardizing all systems and accounting practices for our us businesses 
we currently estimate the results of standardizing our accounting practices will not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
store portfolio perspectives beginning in  we have been working to reduce our share of total system units by selling our restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can be leveraged to improve our concepts overall operational performance  while retaining our ownership of key markets 
in addition  we also began an aggressive program to close our underperforming stores 
our portfolio balancing activity has reduced  and will continue to reduce  our reported revenues and increase the importance of system sales as a key performance measure 
refranchising at appropriate prices frees up invested capital while continuing to generate franchise fees  thereby improving returns 
the impact of refranchising gains is expected to decrease over time as we approach a company franchise balance more consistent with our major competitors 
the following table summarizes our refranchising activities over the last four years total number of units refranchised    refranchising proceeds  pre tax  refranchising net gain  pre tax a b a includes unfavorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge of million 
excluding the adjustments  refranchising net gain was million 
b includes a fourth quarter charge of million 
excluding the charge  the refranchising net gain was million 
the following table summarizes our store closure activities over the last four years total number of units closed  store closure expense a b a includes favorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge of million 
excluding the adjustments  store closure costs were million 
b includes a fourth quarter charge of million 
excluding the charge  store closure costs were million 
our ownership percentage including joint venture units of our core businesses total system units decreased by almost percentage points from year end and by percentage points from year end to at december  this reduction was a result of our portfolio initiatives and the relative number of new points of distribution added and units closed by our franchisees and licensees and by us 
additional factors expected to impact comparisons with our facility actions net gain was million million after tax in excluding favorable adjustments to our fourth quarter charge 
facility actions net loss gain includes refranchising gains or losses  costs of closing underperforming stores and impairment charges for restaurants we intend to continue to use in the business or to close in a future quarter 
facility actions net gain in is expected to be half the level of the net gain recognized in however  if market conditions are favorable  we expect to sell more than the units we have currently forecasted which would impact the amount of our net gain for we are phasing in certain structural changes to our executive income deferral program eid during and which are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
one such change requires all subsequent payouts under the eid to be made only in our common stock rather than cash or common stock at our option 
this restriction applies only if the participant s original deferrals were invested in discounted phantom shares of our common stock 
previously  for accounting purposes  we were required to assume the payment was made in cash 
in  we will no longer expense the appreciation  if any  attributable to the investments in these phantom shares 
if this change had been in effect from the beginning of  general and administrative expenses would have been approximately million million after tax lower than reported 
the impact of the change is dependent on movements in the market price of our common stock and the effect of forfeitures  if any  and cannot currently be estimated 
in  we expect to incur approximately million million after tax of additional charges related to our unusual charge for our strategic decision to streamline our international businesses 
in  we also expect to incur approximately million million after tax of expenses related to the start up of a unified food service purchasing cooperative and costs associated with reducing the workforce in our internal purchasing function 
in  we incurred million million after tax related to the start up of the co op 
in  we completed our relocation of our wichita  kansas operations to other facilities 
the total cost we incurred in of million million after tax included termination benefits  relocation costs  early retirement and other expenses related to this relocation 
due to contractual disputes with the proposed buyer  the expected fourth quarter sale of the facility at a gain to this buyer did not occur and is not considered imminent 
we continue to expect to sell the facility at a price which should at least recover its carrying amount  but cannot estimate either the amount or timing of any potential gain at this time 
certain cost recovery agreements with ameriserve and pepsico reduced our general  administrative and other g a costs by approximately million million after tax 
these agreements were terminated during results of operations our spin off in  our fourth quarter charge  the impacts of the disposal of our non core businesses and fluctuations in the number and amount of gains related to refranchised stores represent significant items which complicate year over year comparisons 
prior to october   our historical financial statements were impacted by our lack of history as an independent  publicly owned company 
the amounts for certain items  specifically general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes  included in our historical reported results for periods prior to the spin off  include allocations or computations which are not indicative of the amounts we would have incurred if we had been an independent  publicly owned company during all periods presented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  comparative information is impacted by the operations of and disposal charges related to our non core businesses in these disposal charges included an estimated provision for all expected future liabilities associated with the disposal of our non core businesses 
we were required to retain these liabilities as part of the spin off 
our best estimates of all such liabilities have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual amounts incurred may ultimately differ from these estimates 
however  we believe the amounts  if any  in excess of our previously recorded liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flow

in addition  we experienced increased administrative expenses as an independent  publicly owned company and incurred additional expenses related to continuing efforts to improve and standardize administrative and accounting systems 
included in our and core g a were pepsico allocations of million and million  respectively  reflecting a portion of pepsico s shared administrative expenses prior to the spin off 
the allocated pepsico administrative expenses were based on pepsico s total corporate administrative expenses using a ratio of our revenues to pepsico s revenues 
we believe this basis of allocation was reasonable based on the facts available at the date of such allocation 
however  our ongoing g a as an independent  publicly owned company in exceeded the annualized amount of the pepsico allocation by approximately million 
the increase was partially offset by the absence of non recurring tricon start up costs of approximately million which were incurred in the increased expenses were higher than the million we estimated in our annual report on form k  primarily due to increased incentive and stock based compensation 
these increased compensation costs are due to better than expected operating results  as well as strong growth in the market value of our common stock for the second half of  partially offset by delays in staffing positions at tricon 
equity income from investments in our unconsolidated affiliates increased million in this increase was due primarily to lower amortization relating to the impact of the joint venture investment impairment included in our fourth quarter charge and  to a lesser extent  the impact of new unit development primarily by our joint venture in the united kingdom 
net foreign exchange gains were million in compared to net foreign exchange losses of million in this improvement was due primarily to non recurring foreign exchange losses  predominantly in thailand and the netherlands  and to foreign exchange gains in primarily due to us dollar denominated short term investments in canada

investment spending consisted primarily of costs related to improving and updating administrative systems  including initial spending of million on year compliance and remediation efforts  as well as investments in certain key international markets 
these higher expenses were partially offset by the lapping of a reorganization charge for pizza hut in  overall lower project spending and field overhead  particularly at pizza hut  and the favorable impacts of stores sold or closed

at that time  in response to the securities and exchange commission s sec interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  we changed our store closure accounting policy 
for closure decisions made subsequent to april   we only recognize any required asset impairment as a component of store closure costs when we have closed the restaurant within the same quarter the closure decision is made 
the impact of this change reduced store closure costs by million which was more than offset by increased impairment described in next paragraph 
we closed units in both and  and units in impairment charges were million in prior to april   our impairment charges resulted from our normal semi annual evaluation of stores which we will continue to use in the business 
stores that meet our two year history of operating losses  our primary impairment indicator  or which we believe may be impaired due to other changes or circumstances are evaluated for impairment 
in  upon adoption of the sec s interpretation of sfas  we also perform impairment evaluations when we expect to actually close a store beyond the quarter in which our closure decision is made 
this change resulted in additional impairment charges of million in we believe the overall decrease in impairment in was significantly impacted by decisions included in our fourth quarter charge to dispose of certain stores which may have otherwise been impaired in our evaluations  and improved performance primarily at pizza hut in the us impairment charges of million in and million in resulted from our semi annual impairment evaluations of restaurants

interest expense  net external debt pepsico allocation interest expense interest income interest expense  net prior to the spin off  our operations were financed through operating cash flows  proceeds from refranchising activities and investment by and advances from pepsico 
at the spin off date  we borrowed billion under a bank credit agreement to replace the financing previously provided by pepsico and  additionally  to fund a dividend to pepsico 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
for periods prior to the spin off  our interest expense included pepsico s allocation of its interest expense pepsico s weighted average interest rate applied to the average balance of investments by and advances from pepsico and interest on our external debt  including capital leases 
we believe such allocated interest expense is not indicative of the interest expense that we would have incurred as an independent  publicly owned company or will incur in future periods 
subsequent to the spin off date  our interest costs consist primarily of interest expense related to our bank credit agreement  unsecured notes and other external debt 
most of the other external debt existed at the spin off date 
our net interest expense decreased approximately million in the decline was due to an increase in interest income  partially offset by a slight increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was driven by higher average international investment balances 
the slight increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to the lower outstanding amount of pepsico provided financing 
this impact was partially offset by the higher interest rate on our bank credit agreement  as compared to the pepsico rate used in the allocation process  and also higher outstanding debt levels

the increase in state tax was primarily due to an increase in the provision related to prior tax years 
the effective tax rate attributable to foreign operations varied from year to year but in each year was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate

consolidated cash flows net cash provided by operating activities refranchising of restaurants capital spending net cash provided by operating activities decreased million or to million in cash used for working capital was million for compared to cash provided by working capital of million in the use was primarily due to an increase in current deferred tax assets and reduced income taxes payable 
excluding net changes in working capital  net income before facility actions and all other non cash charges was essentially unchanged despite the decline in the number of our restaurants in the current year relating to our portfolio activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million or to million 
this was driven by an increase in net income prior to facility actions net loss and unusual charges recorded in and an increase in our normal working capital deficit primarily related to higher income tax payables 
these increases were partially offset by reduced depreciation and amortization in the decrease in depreciation and amortization related to refranchisings  store closures and impairment charges

net cash used for financing activities of billion decreased slightly in compared to the use represents net debt repayments 
during  we issued unsecured notes resulting in proceeds of million  including the settlement of our treasury lock agreements 
these proceeds were used to reduce existing borrowings under our unsecured term loan facility and unsecured revolving credit facility 
net cash used for financing activities almost tripled in to billion  primarily reflecting the net payments to pepsico  partially offset by the bank borrowings in connection with the spin off 
this net use was partially offset by the increase in short term borrowings of million in versus a decrease of million in and payments on the revolving credit facility 
financing activities during  we reduced our reliance on bank debt by over billion by reducing term debt 
term debt was reduced through a combination of proceeds from the debt securities offered under our shelf registration discussed below  proceeds from refranchising activities and operating cash flows 
a key component of our financing philosophy is to build balance sheet liquidity and to diversify sources of funding 
consistent with that philosophy  we have taken steps to refinance a portion of our existing bank credit facility referred to below 
in  we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s with respect to offerings of up to billion of senior unsecured debt 
in early may  we issued million unsecured notes due may   and million unsecured notes due may   under our shelf registration 
the proceeds were used to reduce existing borrowings under our unsecured term loan facility and unsecured revolving credit facility 
we may offer and sell from time to time additional debt securities in one or more series  in amounts  at prices and on terms we determine based on market conditions at the time of sale  as discussed in more detail in the registration statement 
to fund the spin off  we negotiated a billion bank credit agreement comprised of a billion senior  unsecured term loan facility and a billion senior  unsecured revolving credit facility which mature on october  interest is based principally on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a variable margin as defined in the credit agreement 
during the year ended december   we made net payments of billion and million under our unsecured bank term loan facility and the unsecured revolving credit facility  respectively 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are expected to fluctuate from time to time  but term loan reductions cannot be reborrowed 
such payments reduced amounts outstanding at december   to million and billion from billion and billion at year end  on the term facility and revolving facility  respectively 
at december   we had unused revolving credit agreement borrowings available aggregating billion  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
the credit facilities are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants as well as limitations on additional indebtedness including guarantees of indebtedness  cash dividends  aggregate non us investments  among other things  as defined in the credit agreement 
this substantial indebtedness subjects us to significant interest expense and principal repayment obligations  which are limited in the near term  to prepayment events as defined in the credit agreement 
our highly leveraged capital structure could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future or to undertake refinancings on terms and subject to conditions that are acceptable to us 
since october   we have been in compliance with the bank covenants 
we will continue to closely monitor on an ongoing basis the various operating issues that could  in aggregate  affect our ability to comply with financial covenant requirements 
we continue to use various derivative instruments with the objective of reducing volatility in our borrowing costs 
we have utilized interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of our variable rate libor bank debt to fixed rate 
during  we entered into treasury lock agreements to partially hedge the anticipated issuance of our senior debt securities discussed above 
we have also entered into interest rate arrangements to limit the range of effective interest rates on a portion of our variable rate bank debt 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on our variable bank debt  including the effect of derivatives  was 
other derivative instruments may be considered from time to time as well to manage our debt portfolio and to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures 
we anticipate that our combined cash flow from operating and refranchising activities will be lower than levels primarily because of our expectations of reduced refranchising activity 
however  we believe it will be sufficient to support our expected capital spending and still allow us to make significant debt repayments 
consolidated financial condition assets decreased million or to billion at year end this decrease is primarily attributable to refranchising and store closures and a decrease in us cash which was attributable to improved cash management 
liabilities decreased billion or to billion primarily due to net debt repayments 
partially offsetting this decrease is an increase in other liabilities largely due to increased deferred compensation liabilities  pension liabilities and self insured casualty claims 
additional salary and bonus deferrals and imputed earnings on deferrals under our compensation programs caused the deferred compensation liability to increase 
the pension liability increased based on current actuarial valuations 
the increase in casualty claims is due to the decision in the current year to effectively self insure a portion of our exposure compared to a fully insured program in our operating working capital deficit  which excludes cash  short term investments and short term borrowings  is typical of restaurant operations where the vast majority of sales are for cash  and food and supply inventories are relatively small 
our terms of payment to suppliers generally range from days 
our operating working capital deficit decreased million to million at year end this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in income taxes payable and an increase in deferred tax assets 
also contributing to this decrease was a reduction in the core businesses working capital deficit due to our reduced number of restaurants resulting from our portfolio activities and also due to increased inventories of promotional items 
this decrease was partially offset by higher levels of above store accounts payable and other current liabilities due to timing of payments as well as higher levels of outside services and an increase in total incentive compensation accruals 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments our policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
our current use of derivative instruments is primarily limited to interest rate swaps and collars and commodity futures contracts 
interest rate swaps and collars are entered into with the objective of reducing the volatility in borrowing costs 
in and  we entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our variable rate bank debt to fixed rate 
payment dates and the floating rates indices and reset dates on the swaps match those of our underlying bank debt 
at december   our payables under the related swaps aggregated million 
interest rate collars are entered into with the objective of reducing the impact of variable interest rate changes in our bank debt thereby reducing volatility in borrowing costs 
in  we entered into interest rate collars to guarantee an upper cap and lower floor level of interest rates associated with a portion of bank debt 
collar reset dates and indices match those of our underlying bank debt 
we make payments when interest rates fall below the floor level 
we receive payments when interest rates rise above the cap 
at december   our payables under the related collars were immaterial  and there were no related receivables 
our credit risk related to these derivatives is dependent upon both the movement in interest rates and the possibility of non payment by counterparties 
we mitigate credit risk by entering into the agreements only with high credit quality counterparties  netting payments within each contract and netting exposures upon default across all contracts with a given counterparty 
however  we believe the risk of default is minimal 
commodity futures contracts traded on national exchanges are entered into with the objective of reducing food costs 
while this hedging activity has historically been limited  hedging activity could increase in the future if we believe it would result in lower total costs 
open contracts  deferred gains and losses and realized gains and losses were not significant for all years presented 
market risk of financial instruments our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
in addition  less than of our debt is denominated in foreign currencies which exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt was not considered significant 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assumes no change in the volume or composition of debt at december  in addition  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term rates at december  would increase the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts approximately million and  the fair value of our unsecured notes would decrease approximately million 
fair value was estimated by discounting the projected interest rate cash flows
