for the years ended december  and  the aurora casino paid or accrued wagering taxes of million and million  respectively 
had the new rates been in effect during  the wagering tax for the aurora casino would have been million 
management has pursued an operating strategy of implementing changes to its cruising schedule and curtailing marginally profitable operations in response to the increased taxes

write down of assets in connection with a refinancing of its indebtedness in  gbcc issued million discounted principal amount face amount of million of deferred interest notes the ppi funding notes to hcc in exchange for million principal amount of notes issued by another gbcc subsidiary and held by hcc 
it was anticipated that one of hcc s primary methods of realizing the carrying value of the new notes would be through the utilization of existing tax net operating losses of the gbcc group 
as a result of hcc s distribution of gbcc stock at december  to its shareholders  gbcc s tax net operating losses are no longer available for utilization in hcc s consolidated tax returns 
accordingly  at december   hcc provided a valuation allowance in the amount of million which reduced the carrying amount of the ppi funding notes to their estimated realizable value of million at that date 
as a result of the filing for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code by gbcc s most significant operating subsidiary on january   hcc took an additional write down during further reducing the carrying amount of the ppi funding notes at both december  and to an estimated realizable value of million 
management presently anticipates that the remaining balance will be realized through a combination of repayments from gbcc and asset acquisitions from gbcc and its subsidiaries 
during november  hcc loaned million of the proceeds from the offering of its senior secured notes in october see liquidity and capital resources financing activities below to an unaffiliated gaming company in the form of two million notes 
on february   both parties agreed to settle the outstanding obligations with the payment of million and the issuance of two new  short term obligations totaling million  which were paid in april the million difference between the million carrying amount of the notes receivable and the agreed upon settlement was reflected as a write down of the notes receivable as of december  during  management determined that certain properties in texas acquired as potential sites for future development should be offered for sale 
an evaluation of the net realizable value for such sites resulted in a write down for the anticipated loss on disposal of the properties of million for the year ended december  no additional write downs were recorded in or net interest expense net interest expense did not change significantly during compared to net interest expense of the hcc group increased million during compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to additional interest incurred with respect to the new parking garage at the aurora casino which is treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes and to the capitalization of interest at the tunica casino with respect to construction of its new hotel tower during loss gain on disposal of assets the loss results primarily from the sale of certain slot machines at the tunica casino as part of its program to update such equipment  the gain resulted primarily from the sale of a company owned aircraft 
hcc consolidated items income taxes as previously disclosed in hcc s quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   and subsequent to the issuance of the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has determined that it should revise its tax treatment of the spin off of the stock of gbcc which occurred on december  as a result  the and consolidated financial statements have been restated from amounts previously reported to record the appropriate amounts for income taxes  accrued income taxes  deferred taxes  interest and penalties due to the recognition of additional taxable income resulting from the revised tax treatment of the spin off 
for the year ended december   hcc utilized approximately million of its available net operating loss carryforwards nol s as a result of the additional taxable income the company recognized from the spin off 
for alternative minimum tax amt purposes  the revised tax treatment resulted in the company utilizing all of its remaining amt loss carryforwards and being liable for the payment of approximately million in additional amt taxes 
hcc paid its million amt obligation for plus accrued interest thereon during the fourth quarter of as a result of the obligation for amt payments and the impact on net deferred tax assets  the company has restated its consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity deficit from amounts previously reported to provide an additional million charge to paid in capital consistent with the treatment of other effects of the spin off transaction 
for the year ended december   the revised tax treatment resulted in hcc s recognition of additional income tax expense of million and the accrual of interest on the underpayment of its federal tax obligations 
hcc paid million during september with respect to its revised estimated federal income tax obligation 
in connection with the revised tax treatment  hcc has commenced litigation against its former independent accountants and tax advisors alleging negligent advice and breach of contract 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future consolidated taxable income of hcc primarily from the aurora casino and the tunica casino will be sufficient to utilize a portion of the nol s  tax credits and other deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences 
accordingly  under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the consolidated balance sheet reflects net deferred tax assets of million as of december  sales by hcc or existing stockholders of common stock by a five percent stockholder  as defined in the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  can cause a change of control  as defined in section of the code  which would limit the ability of hcc or its subsidiaries to utilize these loss carryforwards in later tax periods 
should such a change of control occur  the amount of loss carryforwards available for use in any one year would most likely be substantially reduced 
future treasury regulations  administrative rulings or court decisions may also effect hcc s future utilization of its loss carryforwards 
tax settlement costs tax settlement costs of million represent both costs incurred to date as well as management s estimate of probable costs to be incurred arising from and directly related to the modification of hcc s tax treatment of the spin off of gbcc stock previously discussed 
extraordinary item hcc is required to make an offer to purchase not more than million in principal amount of its senior secured notes at each semiannual interest payment date 
during  hcc made two redemption offers and redeemed million of the senior secured notes resulting in an extraordinary loss of  during  hcc made one such offer and redeemed million of the senior secured notes 
the redemption resulted in an extraordinary loss of  reduced by an estimated income tax benefit of  year compliance in the year  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than such an error could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
management has initiated a program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications as well as its non information technology embedded microchip systems for the year the initial stage of the program consisted of identifying those systems which might be at risk 
all identified systems were categorized as those necessary for regulatory compliance purposes  essential systems and non essential systems 
within the essential systems group  an additional rating factor of one to five was assigned to each system with a factor of one indicating the greatest significance 
readiness for information technology and non information technology systems for the year is currently being investigated or has been determined by means of vendor certification or internal testing 
system readiness for the year is anticipated to be completed by september with the essential and regulatory systems anticipated to be completed by june the two major information technology systems identified as not year compliant are being updated  modified or replaced 
management expects the costs of acquiring  testing and converting such systems will be less than million 
the majority of these costs will be incurred during and have been included in management s forecast of capital expenditures see liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures and other investing activities below 
the company has also initiated formal communication with its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which its operating and information systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to resolve their year compliance issues 
an initial determination of the company s exposure with respect to third party supplied systems has recently been completed 
additional procedures  if necessary  are now being taken to remediate potential vulnerabilities 
contingency plans are also being developed by management with respect to internally developed systems not fully tested prior to the year accordingly  the company does not anticipate any internal systems failures will have a material impact on its operations or financial condition 
the company will continue its efforts to ensure that major third party vendors as well as public and private providers of infrastructure services such as utilities and communication services will be year compliant 
the failure of such infrastructure services could result in a worst case scenario in which operations relying on such services eg mechanical gaming devices would be temporarily disrupted 
the company can not presently estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures 
while there can be no assurance that the company and its suppliers and customers will fully resolve their year compliance issues  neither the estimated costs nor the outcome of the year problem is expected to have a material impact on the company s operations  liquidity or financial position 
inflation management believes that in the near term  modest inflation  together with increased competition within the gaming industry for qualified and experienced personnel  will continue to cause increases in operating expenses  particularly labor and employee benefits costs 
seasonality and other fluctuations historically  the aurora casino s operations have experienced some seasonality due to severe winter weather 
consequently  the results of hcc s operations for the first and fourth quarters have traditionally been less profitable than the other quarters of the fiscal year 
furthermore  management believes that seasonality may also cause fluctuations in reported results at the tunica casino 
in addition  the operations of the aurora casino and the tunica casino may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including chance 
such seasonality and fluctuations may materially affect hcc s casino revenues and overall profitability 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities the operations of the aurora casino and tunica casino constitute hcc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources 
the aurora casino contributed approximately million of cash flow from operations during after deducting the payment of million of management fees

the internal revenue service is currently examining the consolidated federal income tax returns of hcc for the years through management believes that the results of such examination will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of hcc 
during  consolidated cash flow from operations million  collections on notes receivable million and borrowings under financing agreements million were used  in part  by hcc to fund capital expenditures of million  to repay third party indebtedness and make payments under capital lease obligations of million and  respectively  to fund its initial million investment in a joint venture formed to construct a gaming and hotel facility in shreveport  louisiana and to pay distributions amounting to million to gbcc as limited partner in pml

prt funding and pratt casino corporation pcc  and the holders of million of senior notes currently in default which were issued by prt funding 
under the terms of the agreement  the company would purchase the stock of pcc from gbcc for nominal consideration as part of a debt restructuring the restructuring of prt funding  pcc and other subsidiaries of pcc 
upon completion of the restructuring  pcc s assets will consist of its limited partnership interest in pml and a consulting agreement for the tunica casino 
these assets will serve as collateral for million of new notes to be issued by pcc to the holders of the senior notes as part of the restructuring 
the acquisition of pcc will also result in a charge to expense by the company of approximately million during as no asset value will be attributed to the management contract and consulting agreement when acquired 
after the acquisition of pcc  the company will have incurred additional debt and associated interest  but will no longer report a minority interest in pml nor pay the tunica consulting fee to a gbcc subsidiary 
the minority interest and consulting fee expense totaled million for the year ended december  the successful completion of the restructuring is subject to the execution of definitive documents and will require that pcc and prt funding file for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code with the above transactions included as part of a pre negotiated plan of reorganization
