the company s cash and temporary cash investments at december  were million  or a decrease of million from the company anticipates that available funds  together with anticipated cash flows generated from future operations and amounts available under its line of credit will be sufficient to fund the company s planned capital expenditures and other operating cash requirements through the end of in addition  the company has million of marketable securities  which are invested in public utility preferred stocks under a dividend capture program 
these marketable securities can be converted to cash in a short time period 
in  working capital decreased 
million  from million to million 
the million decrease in current assets at december  versus december  was primarily due to the decrease in cash 
the million decrease in current liabilities is substantially due to decreases in trade payables 
year the year issue relates to the way computer systems  software and some equipment define calendar dates  they could fail or make miscalculations due to interpreting a date including to mean  not in  the company determined that certain of its computer software was originally programmed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  this software could have been unable to process transactions beyond december  if correction or replacement of the software was not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations and could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
the assessment phase of the company s software  systems and equipment began in it was initially determined that the systems most likely to be affected by the year issue were the general accounting systems and payroll 
to remedy the year issue with regard to these areas  the company began devoting significant resources to replace the affected software with a new enterprise computer system 
it was decided that this enterprise computer system should also be implemented for the manufacturing processes 
the company estimates the implementation status of general accounting systems and payroll to be complete for the testing phase and approximately complete for the implementation phase at december  as of this date  the implementation status for manufacturing processes is estimated to be approximately complete for the vehicle segment and approximately complete for the housing segment 
full testing and implementation of the new computer system for all divisions of the company is occurring on an ongoing basis throughout and is expected to be complete in adequate time to enable proper processing of transactions throughout the company before january  the company also initiated a senior management focus team in to identify and review other possible business system failures that could occur and to assess the need for contingency plans 
the focus team is in the process of determining if the company s equipment with embedded systems is year compliant 
the focus team does not believe the company s equipment is  for the most part  calendar date sensitive 
nonetheless  it has initiated an inventory of all such equipment  including telecommunications equipment and facilities 
those business systems considered most critical to continued operations are being given the highest priority 
the company believes the key risk factors associated with year are those from outside the company that it cannot directly control  such as the readiness of its key material suppliers  dealers  customers  financial institutions and public infrastructure suppliers 
the company relies on third parties to provide goods and services necessary for the manufacture and distribution of its products 
the focus team is in the process of identifying and communicating with third party suppliers about the status of their compliance with year as of december   the company has not received sufficient response from its thrid party suppliers to determine the status of their readiness 
the company sells its products to numerous independent dealers 
management believes the risk associated with year compliance by the dealers is minimized since the risk is spread among the dealers 
due to the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties  the company is currently unable to determine whether the consequences of year failures of third parties will have a material impact on the company s operations 
while the company is working diligently to obtain assurance from its mission critical third parties that they will be compliant  there can be no assurance that the systems of any third party on which the company s operations rely will be timely compliant 
nevertheless  the company does not anticipate a material impact on its operations from direct interfaces with third parties 
the focus team is in the process of assessing the risk and the need to develop contingency plans to address potential disruptions that could be caused by third parties 
the company believes the worst case scenario for year issues would be the disruption or unavailability of utility services 
this could hinder or stop the performance of normal business functions  such as manufacturing and selling  and might disrupt retail demand 
however  due to the multiple business locations of the company  its manufacturing facilities  and its owned and independent retail outlets  normal business functions could continue at those locations where utility disruptions or unavailability did not occur 
if they do occur  it is expected they will be temporary  and some utility services may be available from remote locations  as through electric grids 
the focus team is in the process of determining whether a contingency plan is feasible to mitigate worst case disruptions 
the worst case scenario could include halting of production due to the inability of a single source supplier to deliver a critical product or component 
the company is implementing a contingency plan to identify replacement suppliers if a key supplier is unable to adequately assure the company that it will be compliant  and to closely monitor inventory levels of critical components 
the largest exposure appears to be the company s interface with chassis manufacturers for order processing 
the company believes these order processing systems to be year compliant based on statements from representatives of the companies involved 
the chassis suppliers have also advised the company that the chassis are year compliant 
based on a review of its products by segment  vehicles and housing  the company has determined that the products it has sold and will continue to sell should not require remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to the company s products 
the objective of the company and each of its operating subsidiaries is to have all of their significant business systems  including those that affect facilities and manufacturing activities  functioning properly with respect to year  before january  the total cost is currently estimated to be in excess of million  of which approximately million has been incurred as of december  of the amount incurred  
million has been expensed and million has been capitalized for new systems and equipment 
all costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
these costs do not include any costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans 
if determined to be feasible  the company intends to create its contingency plans by september forward looking statements this annual report contains certain statements that are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and are dependent on factors which may include  but are not limited to  the availability of gasoline  which can impact sales of recreational vehicles  availability of chassis  which are used in the production of many of the company s recreational vehicle products  interest rates  which affect the affordability of the company s products  and also on the state of the recreational vehicle and modular housing industries in the united states 
other factors affecting forward looking statements include competition in these industries and the company s ability to maintain or increase gross margins which are critical to the profitability whether there are or are not increased sales  and the company s ability to make its software and equipment year compliant 
at times  the company s actual performance differs materially from its projections and estimates regarding the economy  the recreational vehicle and housing industries and other key performance indicators 
readers of this report are cautioned that reliance on any forward looking statements involves risks and uncertainties 
although the company believes that the assumptions on which the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate given the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events 
there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements contained in this report will prove to be accurate 
the inclusion of a forward looking statement herein should not be regarded as a representation by the company that the company s objectives will be achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing and investing yields 
the company has not utilized its line of credit facilities during the past three years and  accordingly  changes in interest rates would only impact the company s long term debt 
at december   the company had million of long term debt  consisting of industrial development revenue bonds and promissory notes  all of which have variable or floating rates 
the company s marketable securities consist of public utilities preferred stocks which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
these financial instruments are subject to market risk in that changes in interest rates would impact the market value of the preferred stocks 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company utilizes us treasury bond future options as a protection against the impact of increases in interest rates on the fair value of the company s investments in these fixed rate preferred stocks 
outstanding options are marked to market with market value changes recognized in current earnings 
the us treasury bond futures options generally have terms ranging from to days 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   including variable or floating rate debt and derivatives used to hedge the fair value of fixed rate preferred stocks  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
