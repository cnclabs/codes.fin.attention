item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity the company s loan agreement loan agreement  provides for a total facility of million  consisting of a revolving credit facility through may  and a term loan thereafter  maturing on may  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to a borrowing value which is subject to a semi annual redetermination 
as of the latest borrowing value determination  million of the commitment is available to the company 
the loan agreement contains certain covenants which require the company to maintain consolidated tangible net worth of at least million  a current ratio of not less than to  a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to and a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to in addition  working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
at december   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million 
at february   borrowings under the loan agreement totaled million with million available for future borrowings 
the interest rate on the bank debt was and percent at december  and february   respectively 
at the company s election  any portion of the debt outstanding may be fixed at the london interbank offered rate libor rate  as adjusted per the loan agreement depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total borrowing base  for   or days with the remainder of the outstanding debt subject to the chase manhattan bank  n 
a 
prime rate chase prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  the company may not pay in part or in whole the outstanding principal balance of the note to which such libor rate option applies 
at both december  and february   million of borrowings were subject to the libor rate as adjusted 
a commitment fee of of percent is charged for any unused portion of the borrowing base 
shareholders equity at december  was million  making the company s ratio of long term debt to equity 
to the company s primary source of liquidity and capital resources in the near and long term will consist of cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under the loan agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million as compared to million in at december  and january   the company had working capital of million and million  respectively 
the company s capital expenditures during were million 
the company s oil and natural gas operations had capital expenditures of million  with million and million used for exploration and development drilling and producing property acquisitions  respectively 
capital expenditures made by the company s contract drilling operations were million in drilling capital expenditures in were for drill pipe and collars  the refurbishment of one drilling rig previously stacked and major overhauls on large rig components of drilling rigs in service 
the company s drilling rigs are composed of large components some of which  on a rotational basis  are required to be overhauled to assure continued proper performance 
such capital expenditures will continue in future years with approximately million projected for during  the company s oil and natural gas exploration subsidiary plans to continue its developmental drilling program 
however  lower spot market natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of have increased the potential availability of economical producing property acquisitions and  as a result  a larger portion of the company s capital expenditure budget may be shifted to producing property acquisitions in the majority of the company s capital expenditures are discretionary and primarily directed toward increasing reserves and future growth 
current operations are not dependent on the company s ability to obtain funds outside of the company s loan agreement 
the decision to acquire or drill on oil and natural gas properties at any given time depends on market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and the availability of opportunities to obtain financing given the circumstances involved  thus providing the company with a large degree of flexibility in incurring such costs 
depending  in part  on commodity pricing  the company plans to spend approximately million on its exploration capital expenditure program in on november   the company acquired hickman drilling company  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement  entered into by and between the company  hickman drilling company and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of hickman drilling company the selling stockholders 
under the terms of this acquisition  the selling stockholders received  in aggregate   shares of common stock and promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of  payable in five equal annual installments commencing january  the acquisition included nine land contract drilling rigs with depth capacities ranging from  to  feet  spare drilling equipment and approximately million in working capital 
the notes bear interest at the chase prime rate which at both december  and february  was percent 
in december  the company also purchased a mid continent u a  horsepower rig with a  feet depth capacity and spare components from two additional rigs for a total consideration of million  of which  was paid at closing and the balance is being paid out over a period ending no later than three years after the acquisition date 
the balance is paid out monthly with the monthly amount calculated on the basis of a predetermined daily rate multiplied by the number of days in such month that the acquired rig is employed for the account of the seller  all as more fully specified in the acquisition agreement 
if the balance of the purchase price has not been fully paid at the end of three years the remaining amount is to be paid in cash to the seller 
at december   the balance remaining under this purchase agreement was  in march of  a vice president of south america drilling operations was hired to facilitate the company s efforts to expand its contract drilling operations outside the continental united states  specifically into areas of south america 
drilling markets in south america have the potential to provide higher profit margins and higher profit contributions  with longer term multi year contracts which could also provide a leveling effect on drilling rig utilization 
the company has not previously conducted international contract drilling operations  but it anticipates that such operations would involve a number of additional political  economic  currency  tax and other risks and costs not generally encountered in its domestic operations 
to date  the company has not entered into any contracts for international work 
prior to december   the company received monthly payments on behalf of itself and other parties collectively the committed interest from a natural gas purchaser pursuant to a settlement agreement the settlement agreement 
the monthly payments paid by the purchaser for natural gas not taken the prepayment balance were subject to recoupment in volumes of natural gas through a period ending on the earlier of recoupment or december  the recoupment period 
at december   the settlement agreement and the natural gas purchase contracts which were subject to the settlement agreement terminated 
as a result of the settlement agreement  the december  prepayment balance of million became payable in equal annual payments over a five year period 
the first payment of  was due and paid on june  the price per mcf under the settlement agreement was substantially higher than current spot market prices 
the impact of the higher price received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the natural gas previously subject to the settlement agreement is now being sold at spot market prices consistent with primarily all of the rest of the natural gas sold by the company 
oil and natural gas prices received by the company were volatile throughout average oil prices received by the company in december  as compared to january  dropped by percent 
average natural gas prices in december  as compared to january  were one percent higher after recovering from a percent decrease in august and september of the company s average price received for oil during was and the average natural gas price was 
average oil prices and natural gas spot prices received in february were up percent for oil and down percent for natural gas  when compared with december  average prices 
the large drop in natural gas prices in february had a significant impact to the value of the company s natural gas reserves as reported at december  if this lower natural gas price had occurred at year end  it would have caused the company to reduce the carrying value of its natural gas properties by approximately million before taxes 
if prices do not recover from this february level and depending on other variables  the company will record a provision to reduce the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties in the first quarter of oil prices within the industry remain largely dependent upon world market developments for crude oil 
prices for natural gas are influenced by weather conditions and supply imbalances  particularly in the domestic market  and by world wide oil price levels 
declines in natural gas or oil prices could also adversely effect the company operationally by  for example  adversely impacting future demand for its drilling rigs or financially by reducing the price received for its oil and natural gas sales and also by adversely effecting the semi annual borrowing value determination under the company s loan agreement since this determination is calculated on the value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
at december   the company did not have any hedge against the fluctuation in the price of oil and natural gas nor did the company maintain any forward or future contracts relating to the production of its oil and natural gas 
in the first quarter of  the company initiated swap transactions to help manage its exposure to commodity price risk in the month to month sale of natural gas 
these transactions cover approximately percent of the company s daily production and cover the period from march  to june  these activities have been designated as hedging activities by the company and will be accounted for as such 
increases decreases in the fair value of these instruments will generally offset increases decreases in the spot market prices of natural gas 
implicit gains or losses  resulting from changes in the fair value of hedges which have not yet been settled  are not recognized to the extent that they relate to changes in the spot price of anticipated natural gas sales 
gains or losses arising from hedge transactions are recorded in sales in the month of the hedged transaction 
as a result of the depressed condition existing in the contract drilling industry over much of the past decade  the company s ability to fully utilize its complement of drilling rigs during portions of and when there was a rapid increase in drilling activity was limited due to the lack of qualified labor and certain support equipment not only within the company  but in the industry as a whole 
the company s ability to utilize its drilling rigs at any given time is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to  the price of both oil and natural gas  the availability of labor and the company s ability to supply the type of equipment required 
although the company currently does not have a shortage of rig labor or support equipment  the company s management expects that these factors will continue to influence the company s rig utilization especially if demand should rapidly increase 
in the third quarter of  the company s board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of the company s outstanding common stock on the open market 
since that time   shares have been repurchased at prices ranging from to per share 
during the first quarters of  and    and  of the purchased shares  respectively  were reissued as the company s matching contribution to its k employee thrift plan 
at december    treasury shares were held by the company 
year statement the company has initiated a comprehensive assessment of its information technology it and non information technology non it systems to try and ensure that such systems will be year compliant 
the year problem exists because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to define the year 
therefore  these computer programs do not recognize years that begin with a and assume that all years begin with a 
if not corrected many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results which could cause disruption of operations not only for the company but also for its customers and suppliers  so the company has also initiated an assessment of its customers and suppliers efforts to become year compliant 
evaluation of the company s it systems began in house during the company s it systems consist mainly of office computers  related computer programs and mangement financial information software 
the company believes nearly all of the company s hardware is year compliant and approximately percent of its related computer programs and software are year compliant 
the company has expended approximately  and estimates it will expend an additional  to bring the remaining systems compliant by the end of the second quarter of the company s non it systems consist of office equipment and other systems associated with its oil and natural gas properties and its drilling rigs 
the company began assessing these non it systems and the associated cost during the fourth quarter of the assessment and replacement of equipment  if any  should be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company anticipates that the cost associated with non it systems will be minimal 
during the third quarter of  the company issued questionnaires to its key suppliers and customers to assess their preparation for year compliance 
the company received responses from percent of these entities 
approximately percent of the responses indicated that these entities are aware of and are in the process of resolving their year issues 
during the first quarter of  the company will issue second request questionnaires to those key suppliers and customers who did not respond to the questionnaires issued during the third quarter of upon the return of the second request questionnaires from these non affiliated entities  the company will review their responses and will begin the process of assessing the preparedness of these entities 
as noted  the company currently anticipates that all of its internal systems and equipment will be year compliant by the end of the second quarter of and that the associated costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
however  the failure to properly assess or timely implement a material year problem could result in a disruption in the company s normal business activities or operations 
such failures  depending on the extent and nature  could materially and adversely effect the company s operations and financial condition 
as a result  the company will continue to evaluate its year exposure  both internally and externally 
since a portion of the company s overall evaluation of its year readiness will  of necessity  be based on the information to be supplied by and the readiness of the company s key suppliers and customers  the company cannot currently determine the impact  if any  such third parties will have on the company s year exposure 
as noted  the company intends to evaluate this information as  if and when it is made available to it 
to date  the company has not developed a contingency plan 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operations in previous years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  during third and fourth quarters of and throughout as drilling rig day rates and drilling rig utilization increased  the impact of inflation intensified as the availability of related equipment  third party services and qualified labor decreased 
in  the impact of inflation was reduced as oil and natural gas prices became depressed 
the impact on the company in the future will depend on the relative increase  if any  the company may realize in its drilling rig rates and the selling price of its oil and natural gas 
if industry activity suddenly increases substantially  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor will occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in material and labor costs 
these market conditions may limit the company s ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
results of operations versus net income for was  compared with  in increases in the number of rigs utilized and increased natural gas production were more than offset by substantial decreases in the average price received for both oil and natural gas and to a lesser extent from reduced oil production and contract drilling day rates 
oil and natural gas revenues decreased percent in due to a percent and percent decrease in average natural gas and oil prices received  respectively along with a percent reduction in oil production 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in natural gas production 
oil production declined from levels due to the company s emphasis over the past three years in drilling development wells which focused on replacing and increasing natural gas reserves 
average natural gas spot market prices received by the company decreased percent 
the natural gas previously subject to the settlement agreement  which ended at december  and contained provisions for prices higher than current spot market prices  is now being sold at spot market prices consistent with the rest of the natural gas sold by the company 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately  in in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs operating in to rigs operating in daywork revenues per rig per day decreased percent between the comparative years 
during the first three quarters of  the company s monthly rig utilization consistently remained at or above rigs with daywork revenue per rig per day declining by percent from the january rate 
in the fourth quarter utilization dropped percent from the previous quarter and dayrates decreased another percent from the previous quarter 
total daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in decreased operating margins resulted primarily from the decrease in average natural gas and oil prices received by the company between the two years 
total operating costs were percent higher in compared to as the company continues to add producing properties 
operating margins for contract drilling decreased from percent in to percent in margins in were lower primarily due to decreases in both daily rig rates and utilization in the fourth quarter of total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased drilling rig utilization and costs associated with the november hickman acquisition 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization and additional drilling capital expenditures throughout and depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent and the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel increased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs increased 
interest expense increased percent as the company s average outstanding debt increased percent during the average interest rate decreased from percent in to percent in versus net income for was  compared with  in increases in rig utilization  contract drilling day rates  average natural gas prices received and natural gas production from new wells drilled during the year all combined to produce the increase in net income 
oil and natural gas revenues increased percent in due to a percent and percent increase in natural gas production and average natural gas prices received  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a percent decline in oil production and a percent decrease in average oil prices received by the company in oil production declined from levels due to the company s emphasis over the past two years in drilling development wells which focused on replacing and increasing natural gas reserves 
average natural gas spot market prices received by the company increased percent while volumes produced from certain wells included under the settlement agreement  which ended at december  and contained provisions for prices higher than current spot market prices  dropped percent 
the impact of higher prices received under the settlement agreement increased pre tax income by approximately  and  in and  respectively 
in  revenues from contract drilling operations increased by percent as average rig utilization increased from rigs operating in to rigs operating in  and daywork revenues per rig per day increased percent 
during the first three quarters of  the company s monthly rig utilization consistently remained above rigs with daywork revenue per rig per day steadily climbing by percent 
in october utilization dropped slightly below rigs before the company acquired rigs through the hickman acquisition in late november and another rig in december  raising the company s rig count to rigs and its utilization in december to rigs 
daywork revenue per rig per day continued to rise in the fourth quarter  but the company s average dayrate declined percent in december compared to november since the acquired rigs  due to their depth capabilities  earned lower dayrates 
total daywork revenues represented percent of total drilling revenues in and percent in turnkey and footage contracts typically provide for higher revenues since a greater portion of the expense of drilling the well is born by the drilling contractor 
operating margins revenues less operating costs for the company s oil and natural gas operations were percent in compared to percent in increased operating margins resulted primarily from the increase in natural gas production and the increase in natural gas prices received by the company between the two years 
total operating costs were percent lower in compared to operating margins for contract drilling increased from percent in to percent in margins in improved due to increases in daily rig rates and utilization 
total operating costs for contract drilling were up percent in versus due to increased drilling rig utilization 
contract drilling depreciation increased percent in response to increased rig utilization and additional drilling capital expenditures throughout depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties increased percent as the company increased its equivalent barrels of production by percent and the company s average dd a rate per equivalent barrel increased percent to in general and administrative expenses increased percent as certain employee costs and outside services increased 
interest expense decreased percent as the average interest rate on the company s outstanding bank debt decreased from percent in to percent in average bank debt also decreased percent during prior to  the company s effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by its net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   the company s net operating loss and statutory depletion carryforwards were fully recognized for financial reporting purposes  therefore  the company s effective income tax rate in and increased to approximately the statutory rate
