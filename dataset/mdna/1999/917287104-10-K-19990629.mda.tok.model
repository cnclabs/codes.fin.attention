item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of ursus should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and other information regarding ursus included elsewhere in this form k 
we are a facilities based provider of international telecommunications services 
we offer a broad range of discounted international and enhanced telecommunication services  including us originated long distance service and direct dial international service  typically to small and medium sized businesses and travelers 
our primary service is call reorigination  which accounted for approximately of our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  we also sell services to other carriers and resellers on a wholesale basis 
our retail customer base  which includes corporations and individuals  is primarily located in south africa  latin america  the middle east lebanon and egypt  germany  france and japan 
we operate a switched based digital telecommunications network 
we installed our first switch in sunrise  florida  which became fully operational in october as of march   we operated six nact stx switches with a capacity of  ports out of our central hub in sunrise  florida 
we installed an additional switch in paris  france during the quarter ended march   which became operational on march  on september   as described below  we acquired access authority 
this acquisition effectively tripled the number of minutes going through our switches 
from november until the current time  we have grown by marketing our services through a worldwide network of independent agents which now serves in the aggregate approximately  active registered subscribers as of march  usage of our services has increased from  minutes in the fiscal year ended march  to  minutes in the fiscal year ended march  on september   we purchased all the issued and outstanding common stock of access for million in cash 
access provides international long distance telecommunication services  including call reorigination  domestic toll free access and various value added features to small and medium sized businesses and individuals in over countries throughout the world 
access markets its services through an independent and geographically dispersed sales force consisting of agents and wholesalers 
access operated a switching facility in clearwater  florida  which has now been fully integrated into our sunrise  florida facility 
we have accounted for the access acquisition using the purchase method 
accordingly  the results of operations of access are included in our consolidated results as of september   the date of acquisition 
under the purchase method of accounting  we have allocated the purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values 
our management believes that the funds raised by our initial public offering has and will allow us to expand our customer base and the number of markets we penetrate by o acquiring competitors using the remaining portion of the proceeds of our initial public offering as the cash component of the purchase price for strategic acquisitions and using debt as the other component of the purchase price 
we believe such leveraged acquisitions will add additional annual revenues to our business 
deregulation and increased competition in the telecommunications industry have created a strong motivation to gain market share rapidly in selective markets through acquisitions 
o acquiring equity interests in our exclusive agents in selected markets to further solidify the contractual relationships with these agents and to expand our business in markets offering favorable opportunities and returns 
o deploying new technologies such as ip telephony technology to bypass today s switched telephone network by using cost effective packet switched networks and or the public internet for the delivery of fax and some voice communications 
we intend to deploy a number of fax servers and pop s in selected countries to exploit the opportunities provided by ip telephony technology 
this strategy will allow for more aggressive market penetration in selected markets  particularly in regulated markets  and a possible reduction in transmission costs 
o purchasing telecommunications equipment  including switches  using financing arrangements in order to expand our direct access and ip network 
o developing an electronic commerce e commerce internet site called thestream 
com  which will enable subscribers from around the world to enjoy a full array of our services on line and in real time 
further  the site will incorporate a series of high quality and client friendly service options such as voice over the internet  pc to phone and other sophisticated web centric applications 
revenue the geographic origin of our revenues is as follows year ended march  africa    europe    latin america    middle east    other    united states    our subscriber base has grown as follows as of number of subscribers march   march   march   subscribers are defined as the number of users of our network whether as a direct retail customer or through a wholesaler reseller 
the number of our independent agents has varied as follows as of number of independent agents march  march  march  of which are non exclusive 
the number of agents is based on the average number of active agents on a monthly basis 
the percentage of retail minutes sold to retail end users and wholesale minutes sold to other telecommunication carriers and resellers revenues has been as follows period ended retail wholesale year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  we expect that wholesale revenues will increase in the near term and may become a more significant portion of our total revenue 
we generate retail revenues primarily through our independent agents 
no single subscriber represents or more of our revenue 
agency agreements can be exclusive or non exclusive and typically have an initial term of five years with two additional three year renewal periods 
the four largest independent agents account for approximately of our revenue for the year ended march  any material disruption in or termination of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
an adverse economical and political climate in russia during fiscal year has contributed to a substantial slow down in our business from this region and has resulted in the termination of our agency agreement in moscow 
similarly  our agency agreement in ecuador was also terminated and resulted in significant bad debt 
the total revenues from these regions in fiscal year amounted to approximately of which approximately was from russia and approximately from ecuador 
we believe our retail services are priced below those of the itos in each country in which we offer our services 
prices for telecommunications services in many of our core markets have declined as a result of deregulation and increased competition 
we believe that worldwide deregulation and increased competition are likely to continue to reduce our retail revenues per billable minute 
we believe  however  that any decrease in retail revenues per minute will be at least partially offset by an increase in billable minutes by our customers 
in addition  our cost per billable minute has decreased as a result of the deployment of direct access facilities  the application of ip telephony technology particularly for fax transmissions  and our ability to exploit purchasing discounts based on increased traffic volumes 
cost of revenues and gross margin the most significant portion of our cost of revenues are transmission and termination costs which vary based on the number of minutes used 
we purchase switched minutes from other carriers 
we have historically purchased a portion of the minutes subject to fixed volume commitments 
carriers have recently reserved the right to terminate these agreements upon short notice 
we have historically been able to arrange favorable volume purchase arrangements based upon our high usage and excellent credit history  and these arrangements continue under more recent terminable agreements 
during the last year  our segment of the international telecommunications industry has experienced a continuing tightening of gross margins due to declining retail and wholesale prices 
despite such adverse trends we were able to increase  during fiscal year ended march   our gross margin by to a yearly average of 
factors impacting our margin performance are primarily the reduction of carrier costs as a percentage of revenues 
this was due to volume induced discounts resulting from the dramatic growth in traffic due to the acquisition of access  the deployment of the ip network and the resulting increased utilization of fixed dedicated circuit facilities 
the reduction in retail prices reflects increased competition arising from deregulation as well as our strategic decision to gain market share and increase revenue through more competitive pricing 
by increasing total minutes purchased through aggressive retail and wholesale expansion  we expect to reduce the rates we pay for switched minutes through volume discounts and other mechanisms 
the benefits of such cost reductions  however  can have a slower impact on our operating results compared to the more immediate revenue reductions resulting from price discounting 
our cost of providing telecommunications services to customers consists largely of variable costs associated with origination  transmission and termination of voice and data telecommunications services over other carriers facilities and costs associated with owning or leasing and maintaining switching facilities and circuits 
currently  the variable portion of our cost of revenue predominates  based on the larger proportion of call reorigination customers and the number of minutes of use transmitted and terminated over other carrier s facilities 
thus  our existing gross profitability primarily reflects the difference between revenues and the cost of transmission and termination over other carriers facilities 
we are seeking to lower the variable portion of our cost of services by eventually originating  transporting and terminating a higher portion of our traffic over our own network or via media such as the internet and private data networks and by increasing our purchasing power and volume discounts through an increase in the number of minutes we purchase from other carriers 
in addition  we seek to reduce our cost of revenues by expanding and upgrading the network  by adding more owned and leased facilities and increasing the traffic volume carried by these facilities 
this should result in lower variable costs as a percentage of our revenues  including the higher access costs associated with call reorigination 
this would allow us to spread the fixed costs over increasing traffic volumes and negotiate lower cost of transmission over the facilities owned and operated by other carriers  principally through increased purchasing volumes and expanding our least cost routing choices and capabilities 
we realize higher gross margins from our retail services than from our growing wholesale services which currently average about margin 
our overall gross margins may  however  fluctuate in the future based on the mix of wholesale and retail international long distance services and the percentage of calls using private circuits  direct access and or call through compared to call reorigination 
operating expenses operating expenses include commissions  selling expenses  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses 
we pay commissions to our network of independent agents 
our decision to use independent agents has been driven by the low initial fixed costs associated with this distribution channel and the agents familiarity with local business and marketing practices 
commissions paid as a percentage of retail revenues have been as follows year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  because our contracts with agents are generally long term  commissions have remained stable as a percentage of revenue at least until the acquisition of access 
since the acquisition of access  we have increased our wholesale business and therefore have decreased commissions as a percentage of sales 
we do not pay commissions to generate wholesale sales 
we expect that commissions will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues as a result of increased direct access traffic  which typically has lower commission rates and increased wholesale traffic  which typically has no commissions 
selling expenses  exclusive of commissions  consist of selling and marketing costs  including salaries and benefits  associated with attracting and servicing independent agents 
we perform standard due diligence prior to signing agency agreements and then expend significant time training the agents in our practices and procedures 
our general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  benefits and corporate overhead  including bonuses paid to executive officers 
we believe our general  selling and administrative costs are lower relative to our competitors  due to our agent network 
we have achieved these results because of our ability to attract  train and retain high quality independent agents and because the independent agents contractually assume the risk of credit loss and the cost of collection on the underlying sales 
our financial results may reflect higher levels of bad debt losses as our wholesale and other lines of business expand and as we make equity investments in our independent agents 
we expect that general and administrative expenses may increase as a percentage of revenues in the near term as we incur additional costs associated with our development and expansion  expansion of our marketing and sales organization  and introduction of new telecommunications services such as internet based web centric products 
in addition to our efforts to reduce our cost of revenue sold by migrating customers to direct access and by deploying ip telephony technology and maximizing volume discounts  we are also actively seeking to reduce our selling  general and administrative expenses 
a major emphasis has been placed on continuing to re evaluate our consolidation program with access 
in keeping with this focus of reducing selling and administrative expense  we have utilized our network of exclusive independent agents to bear much of the marketing expenses that our competitors may bear directly 
furthermore  our strategy of using our competitors infrastructure to carry our telecommunications traffic also limits our fixed costs 
we are aggressively managing our back office systems  by developing and implementing efficient computerized systems in order to maximize the efficiency of selling  general and administrative expenses and maximize our existing productivity per employee 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of the expenses associated with our investments in equipment and the acquisition of access 
we expect that depreciation and amortization will continue to increase substantially as we install additional switches and other fixed facilities 
we expect these increased costs will be amortized over an increased revenue base  resulting in stable percentage costs 
other income expense consists primarily of interest expense on long term debt and interest income earned in connection with short term investments  loss on equity investment and other non recurring items 
summary of operating results stated as a percentage of revenues year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses commission selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income results of operations for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  revenues 
revenues increased million from million for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the revenue increase attributable to the access acquisition amounted to million for the year ended march  ursus  on a consolidated basis  had a million increase in minutes of traffic for a total of million minutes versus million minutes over the same period last year 
access contributed approximately million minutes to ursus on a consolidated basis since its acquisition on september  revenue per minute declined from per minute to per minute or about over the fiscal year period resulting from the lower per minute rates generated by access since october  the decrease in revenue per minute is consistent with our entry into the more mature markets of germany and japan and with an increase of in wholesale sales which traditionally generate lower revenues per minute 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased from to 
this decrease in our costs as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects declining carrier cost per minute as the result of aggressive rate negotiation  volume discounts  as well as the use of advanced least cost routing techniques and the gradual deployment of the ip telephony network 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased from during the year ended march  to for the year ended march  gross profit increased as a result of a reduction in carrier costs as a percentage of revenue  despite higher wholesale sales  which traditionally have lower margins 
the acquisition of access more than tripled the number of minutes ursus purchased thereby increasing the likelihood of further volume based carrier discounts 
for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march   the average cost per minute has decreased approximately to an average of per minute 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million for the year ended march  to million for the year ended march  the increase was due primarily to the acquisition of access  which added approximately million in operating expenses 
in addition  we had an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of salaries and benefits for executives  additional marketing  customer service and accounting personnel and increased bad debt expenses 
as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased from to 
we have aggressively expanded our personnel and operational infrastructure in anticipation of increased traffic and revenues through the implementation of our acquisition program and other marketing sales programs  such as  the ongoing e commerce initiative 
we expect that operating expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease with the final integration of the operations of access  the start of the e commerce site and other potential future acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately  from approximately  for the year ended march  to approximately  for the year ended march  as a result of the expansion of our infrastructure in connection with its acquisition program and the deployment of our ip network 
the increase is attributable to new switches  upgrades to existing switches  the purchase of additional computer equipment and software  and leasehold improvements 
in addition  amortization of the intangibles as a result of the acquisition of access was approximately  as compared to zero amortization expense for the same period last year 
operating income 
operating income decreased from million for the year ended march  to approximately million for the year ended march  primarily as a result of a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and a increase in depreciation and amortization 
other income expense 
other income increased approximately by  from approximately  for the year ended march  to approximately  for the year ended march  this increase was primarily due to investment income derived from the invested proceeds of funds from our initial public offering and the resolution of a carrier billing dispute 
net income 
as a result of all of the foregoing factors  particularly a increase in operating expenses  and in light of our strategic decision to increase our gross revenues and market share through price reductions  our net income decreased approximately million from approximately million for the year ended march  to approximately million for the year ended march  net income has also been impacted by start up losses from our subsidiaries in france and argentina  which amounted to approximately  for the year ended march  management believes that our current strategy to actively implement new network while controlling selling  general and administrative expenses  in addition to increasing the revenue base through acquisition  aggressive pricing and the e commerce initiative may result in greater net income in the future 
year ended march  compared to march  revenues 
revenues increased million from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in revenues reflects increased billed retail customer minutes  particularly in the south african and middle eastern markets 
in addition  we earned million of wholesale revenue in the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  in the fiscal year ended march  cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in cost of revenues primarily reflects an increase in sales volume  based on number of minutes sold 
costs of revenues as a percentage of sales increased from to  because selling prices per minute decreased faster than costs per minute 
this increase in our costs as a percentage of revenues primarily reflects declining retail prices  the growth of the less profitable wholesale business  and increasing incremental non billable access costs associated with our call reorigination business 
as discussed in cost of goods sold and gross margin above  retail price reductions tend to reduce gross revenues before the benefits of the negotiated volume based rate reductions by carriers can be realized  a fact which resulted in a decline in the gross profit margin in the retail segment of revenues from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the fiscal year ended march  our margins for fiscal year ended march  reflected this trend  despite the increased costs of revenues being in part mitigated by the settlement of a dispute regarding a purchase contract from a supplying carrier 
the effect of such settlement was a one time savings in cost of revenues equal to 
gross profits 
gross profit increased million from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased from in the fiscal year ended march  to in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit margin decreased because sales price per minute decreased faster than cost price per minute  and we began our wholesale carrier business which operates on much lower gross profit margins of as compared to for the retail segment for the fiscal year ended march  the reduction in prices reflects price competition from deregulation as well as our strategic decision to gain market share and increase revenue through more competitive pricing 
by increasing total minutes purchased not only through aggressive retail expansion  but also through expansion of our wholesale business  we eventually expect to reduce the rates we pay for switched minutes through volume discounts and other mechanisms 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was due to an increase in commission expense of million reflecting increased gross revenues in spite of a decrease in total commission paid to agents as a percentage of retail revenues  and increases in salaries and wages of million and a general sg a expenses increase of million 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by  primarily because additional sg a expenses were more than offset by increased revenues in the fiscal year ended march   and our sg a expenses were absorbed by a larger base of revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately  from approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  to approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  as a result of switch upgrades  the purchase of additional computer equipment and software  and leasehold improvements 
interest expense 
interest was approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  and  in the fiscal year ended march   reflecting a reduction in our outstanding long term debt 
operating income 
operating income decreased million from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  primarily as a result of decreased gross margin rates due to the increase in cost of revenues from to of revenues  this despite the fact that total operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 
other operating expenses did not change significantly 
net income 
as a result of all of the foregoing factors including a increase in sg a  and in particular because of our strategic decision to increase our gross revenues through price reductions  net income decreased approximately  from approximately million in the fiscal year ended march  to approximately million in the fiscal year ended march  year ended march  compared to march  revenues 
revenues increased million  from in to million in the increase in revenues primarily resulted from an increase in billed customer minutes from retail sales  principally in the international call reorigination business 
this increase reflects our increased market penetration  especially in the south african  russian and middle eastern markets 
the total number of independent agents increased from to in addition  we earned wholesale revenues of million in with no corresponding amount in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million from million in to million in  principally reflecting the increased amount of traffic being handled by us 
the slight increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects our wholesale revenues in the fiscal year ended march  with a lower profit margin than retail revenues of million  with no corresponding amount in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit 
gross profit increased million from million in to million in reflecting the increase in number of minutes billed 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased from in to in the gross profit margin on the retail segment of the business was compared to for the fiscal year ended march   while wholesale revenues generated a gross profit margin  which was unusually high due to a one time favorable rate arbitrage opportunity on a route to thailand 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million from million to million 
this increase was due to an increase in commission costs of million attributable to the increased sales volume generated by our independent agents 
bonuses paid to officers pursuant to their employment agreements  additional consulting and travel expenses related to maintaining and improving agency relations  additional legal and professional fees and travel expenses related to the attempt by us to secure expansion financing and negotiate strategic alliances resulted in increased costs of million 
in addition  we increased staffing levels from to and secured additional office facilities at our headquarters in sunrise  florida resulting in increased costs of million 
the growth in other categories of operating expenses of million related primarily to our increased level of activity 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately  as a result of switch upgrades  the purchase of additional computer equipment and software  and leasehold improvements incurred in connection with the office expansion 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased slightly to in from in  as additional revenue offset the additional costs and expenses 
operating income 
operating income increased by million from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  operating income decreased by to in from in  primarily reflecting a reduction created by the impact of the commencement of the lower margin wholesale business in interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  from approximately  reflecting reductions in long term debt 
net income 
as a result of these factors  and principally reflecting the growth in our minutes billed to customers  net income increased to million from million in liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements consist of capital expenditures in connection with the acquisition and maintenance of our switching capacity  e commerce web site and other and working capital requirements 
historically  our capital requirements have been met primarily through funds provided by operations  term loans funded or guaranteed by our majority shareholder and capital leases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in net cash used in operating activities was million in the net cash provided by operating activities in and mainly reflects net earnings offset by increases in accounts receivable relative to accounts payable to carriers 
for the fiscal year ended march   the net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a reduction of carrier and other payables subsequent to the acquisition of access 
the decrease also resulted from a reduction in net income in fiscal as compared to fiscal and net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash used in investing activities in  and principally reflects an increase in equipment purchases 
in fiscal we made several acquisitions which resulted in cash payments of approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately  in and  in cash provided by financing activities was million in the activities consisted of debt repayment  primarily to our bank for long term financing obtained in and net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately  reflecting debt repayment and deferred costs related to our initial public offering 
for the year ended march   the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from the sale of our stock in the initial public offering offset by lease payments 
on may   we completed our initial public offering  which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
aggregate proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock by us in the initial public offering were  net proceeds of the initial public offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and professional fees  aggregated approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of access  we utilized million  representing the purchase price plus the costs of the transaction 
in addition  we have utilized approximately million for the starcom acquisition and million for working capital purposes 
consequently  approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering remain as of march  we expect that the million of net proceeds remaining from our initial public offering  together with internally generated funds  will provide sufficient funds for us to expand our business as planned and to fund anticipated growth for the next months 
however  the amount of our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including performance of our business  the rate and manner in which we expand  staffing levels and customer growth  as well as other factors not within our control  including competitive conditions and regulatory or other government actions 
if our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate or the net proceeds of the initial public offering  together with internally generated funds or other financing  prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  then some or all of our development and expansion plans could be delayed or abandoned  or we may have to seek additional funds earlier than anticipated 
in order to provide flexibility for potential acquisition and network expansion opportunities  we may seek in the near future to enter into a financing arrangement 
other future sources of capital for us could include public and private debt  including a high yield debt offering  equipment leasing facilities  and equity financing 
there can be no assurance that any such sources of financing would be available to us in the future or  if available  that they could be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
while such a financing may provide us with additional capital resources that may be used to implement our business plan  the incurrence of indebtedness could impose risks  covenants and restrictions on us that may affect us in a number of ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations may be required for the repayment of interest and principal payments arising from the financing  with such cash flow not being available for other purposes  such a financing could impose covenants and restrictions on us that may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business or that could restrict our ability to redeem stock  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets and consummate mergers  consolidations  investments and acquisitions  and our degree of indebtedness and leverage may render us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business  in the telecommunications industry or the economy generally 
on december  and in connection with our growth strategy  we entered into an equipment lease facility of up to million  which provides for leases of four to five years at market interest rates 
the interest rates are fixed at the inception of each lease  with subsequent leases based on the change in five year treasury securities 
seasonality we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  a decrease in the use of our services in the months of august and december due to the closing of many businesses for holidays in europe and the united states during those months 
risks associated with the year overview we are currently in the final stages of evaluating whether we will encounter any problems related to the year the impact of the year  which has been widely reported in the media  could cause malfunctions in certain software and databases that use date sensitive processing relating to the year and beyond 
we have completed an evaluation of all our systems and found that most of the computer systems  software and database which are proprietary to ursus are year ready 
we have also begun to evaluate third party business entities with which we are engaged in business or for which we provide services  to determine if there will be any unexpected interruptions 
we have requested representations from these third parties as to whether or not they anticipate any difficulties in addressing year problems and  if so  whether or not we would be adversely affected by any of such problems 
our management expects to have this process completed by the end of the third quarter of we have obtained representations from the manufacturer of the telephony switches that they are year ready 
as these switches are critical to us  they have been tested internally and found to be year ready 
our billing system  which was scheduled for an upgrade for operational reasons will be upgraded to a year ready version in the second quarter of fiscal at minimal cost to us 
we have received assurances from other software and equipment manufactures that their hardware and software are year ready 
costs our management has determined that costs to correct any problems encountered with the year will be immaterial 
however  until such time as the third parties with which we conduct business respond to us  the full impact of the year is not known 
as a result  the impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition cannot be assessed with certainty 
risks we believe that we will complete our goal of readiness prior to december  consequently  we do not believe that the year problem will have a material adverse effect on our business  cash flows  or results of operations 
however  if we do not achieve readiness prior to december   if management s plan fails to identify and remedy all critical year problems or if major suppliers or customers experience material year problems  our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
contingency plans we have begun to develop appropriate contingency plans to mitigate  to the extent possible  any significant year noncompliance  if any 
we expect to complete our contingency plans by september  if we are required to implement our contingency plans  the cost of year readiness may be greater than the amount referenced above and there can be no assurance that these plans will be adequate
