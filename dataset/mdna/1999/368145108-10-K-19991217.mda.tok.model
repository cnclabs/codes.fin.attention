item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general demand for brown paper packaging has historically corresponded primarily to changes in the rate of growth of the manufacturing sector in the us economy 
growth in the us economy generally stimulates demand for packaging products 
historically  the industry s cyclical nature has been driven by the inelasticity of supply due to the capital intensive nature of the industry 
because productive capacity cannot be added quickly  containerboard and unbleached kraft paper inventory levels tend to fall during periods of rising demand  exerting upward pressure on prices 
in periods when capacity exceeds demand  efforts to control inventory levels have been viewed as limited  because containerboard and unbleached kraft paper mills operate most economically near capacity operating levels 
consolidation among major containerboard industry producers during the past to months has resulted in the mothballing of approximately percent of the domestic containerboard capacity 
this rationalization combined with limited new containerboard capacity additions and stable domestic demand growth has resulted in relatively balanced industry supply demand conditions 
demand for unbleached kraft paper has declined in recent years due to displacement by plastics 
the company can vary its production of unbleached kraft paper  depending on market conditions  because all four of the company s paper machines that produce unbleached kraft paper also have the capability to produce containerboard 
from the fall of through the fall of  published linerboard and grocery sack paper transaction prices declined approximately percent and percent  respectively 
published industry prices for linerboard and grocery sack paper recovered significantly throughout fiscal and fiscal  increasing approximately percent and percent  respectively  and reaching record highs 
increases in industry containerboard capacity and softening demand for corrugated containers contributed to a decrease in published prices for linerboard and grocery sack paper of approximately percent and percent  respectively  between september and september  and an additional percent and percent  respectively  through september by september  published linerboard prices had recovered slightly  increasing by approximately percent over september levels  while grocery sack paper prices remained flat over the same period 
the industry experienced a percent increase in linerboard and a percent increase in grocery sack paper published industry prices in september compared to september november published industry prices for linerboard remained unchanged from september levels 
results of operations year ended september  fiscal compared with year ended september  fiscal 
net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of percent compared with net sales of million in fiscal operating income for fiscal was million compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal fiscal resulted in a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal  which included a million extraordinary loss per share on the early retirement of debt 
sales in fiscal were unfavorably affected by lower average net selling prices  which decreased net sales by approximately million 
higher corrugated shipments increased net sales by approximately million in the year to year comparison 
gross margin increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year primarily due to lower fiber costs million and higher volume million 
these improvements were offset in part by reduced earnings from the company s chemical subsidiary  as a result of a significant decline in demand for the subsidiary s products in asian markets in the first half of fiscal million 
corrugated shipments increased approximately percent in fiscal to billion square feet compared to billion square feet in fiscal  primarily as a result of opening a new sheet feeder plant in the first quarter of fiscal and increased demand 
multiwall bag shipments decreased approximately percent to thousand tons in fiscal compared to thousand tons in the prior year 
total mill production increased by percent to  tons per day tpd  calculated on the basis of the number of days in the period in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal containerboard production increased approximately percent to  tpd in fiscal compared to  tpd in the prior year 
unbleached kraft paper production increased approximately percent to tpd in fiscal from tpd in fiscal average selling prices were essentially unchanged for corrugated products and increased approximately percent for multiwall bags due mainly to a mix change in fiscal compared to the prior year 
average selling prices decreased for the company s domestic linerboard  export linerboard and unbleached kraft paper  by approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal fiber costs decreased primarily due to lower average delivered costs for recycled fiber and wood chips 
the average delivered cost for occ old corrugated containers and dlk double lined kraft clippings decreased approximately percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreased demand 
in addition  the average delivered cost for wood chips decreased by approximately percent in fiscal compared to the prior year 
unusually wet weather in the southern us resulted in higher wood chip costs in fiscal selling and administrative costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to higher information system costs related primarily to the year effort  and increased long term incentive and litigation costs 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher average debt levels increased interest expense by approximately million  while lower average borrowing rates reduced interest expense by approximately million 
the lower average borrowing rates resulted primarily from the refinancing of the company s senior subordinated debentures in the second quarter of fiscal the company recognized a tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the tax benefit decreased in the year over year comparison primarily due to improved operating results in fiscal over fiscal the effective tax rate was approximately percent in both fiscal and fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  the company issued million principal amount of senior notes due in and million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due in and used the proceeds to redeem and retire all of the then outstanding senior subordinated debentures million principal amount due in in conjunction with the retirement  approximately million of deferred financing fees were written off

in fiscal  the net loss was million  or per share  after a million extraordinary loss per share on the early retirement of debt 
sales and earnings in fiscal were favorably affected by higher average selling prices for the company s products which increased net sales by approximately million compared with the prior year 
average selling prices for the company s domestic linerboard  export linerboard and corrugated products increased approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal over fiscal average selling prices increased approximately percent for unbleached kraft paper and percent for multiwall bags compared to the prior year 
higher volumes of corrugated products shipped in fiscal increased sales by approximately million compared to fiscal corrugated shipments increased approximately percent in fiscal to billion square feet compared to billion square feet in fiscal  primarily due to the start up of a new sheet feeder facility in the first quarter of fiscal multiwall bag shipments increased approximately percent to thousand tons in fiscal compared to thousand tons in the prior year 
total mill production decreased to  tons per day tpd  calculated on the basis of the number of days in the period in fiscal compared to  tpd in fiscal containerboard production was essentially unchanged with  tpd in fiscal compared with  tpd in the prior year 
unbleached kraft paper production decreased to tpd in fiscal from tpd in fiscal  due primarily to market related downtime 
gross margin increased to million from million in the prior year 
gross margin was favorably impacted by higher volume million and higher average selling prices million for the company s products 
the favorable impact was reduced by higher fiber costs million and incremental fixed costs associated with the start up of the new sheet feeder facility million 
increased fiber costs were primarily due to higher prices for wood chips with an average delivered cost increase of approximately percent in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in wood chip cost was due to unseasonably wet weather in the southern us and increased demand relative to supply 
meanwhile  old corrugated container occ costs decreased by approximately percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  which partially offset the effect of the increased wood chip costs 
selling and administrative costs were million for fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to higher information system costs principally related to the year effort  higher costs associated with employee recruitment and retention  incremental costs for the new sheet feeder facility and general inflation 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal higher average debt levels increased interest expense by approximately million  while lower average borrowing rates reduced interest expense by approximately million 
the lower average borrowing rates were the result of the fiscal refinancing of the senior subordinated debentures due  and the refinancing of the senior notes due in mid fiscal the company recognized a tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the tax benefit decreased in the year over year comparison primarily due to improved operating results in fiscal over fiscal the effective tax rates in fiscal and fiscal were approximately and percent  respectively

liquidity and capital resources general the company has historically financed its operations through cash provided by operations  borrowings under its credit agreements and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the company s principal uses of cash are to pay operating expenses  fund capital expenditures and service debt 
the company is prohibited from paying dividends and making purchases of additional common stock by the terms of its bank credit agreement and public debt securities 
net cash used for operations for fiscal was million compared to million for the prior year 
the improvement was due to a decrease in working capital requirements 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal in addition to capital spending  the company acquired million  million and million of equipment through vendor financing or capital leases in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
since its inception in  the company has made significant capital expenditures primarily to expand capacity  install advanced papermaking technology  improve product quality  realize operating efficiencies and maintain its existing facilities 
for fiscal  capital spending is expected to be in the range of to million  while capital spending beyond fiscal will be targeted to approximate the company s annual depreciation expense 
capital spending will  however  be adjusted from time to time as market conditions and available cash flows dictate 
in fiscal  the company determined it would be unlikely that its antioch  california unbleached kraft paper mill the east mill  which was closed in fiscal  could be sold as a mill site or that the east mill  or a portion thereof  could be operated economically by the company 
in fiscal  the company incurred approximately million of costs for demolition and asbestos removal and to maintain the east mill 
such costs were net of proceeds from the sale of scrap 
at the end of fiscal  approximately million of spending remained to complete the demolition work 
management expects to complete the remaining demolition during fiscal at september   the balance sheet reserve for demolition was approximately million and the net book value of the east mill was million 
liquidity at september   the company had cash and equivalents of million  an increase of million from september  as cash from financing exceeded cash used for operations and investments 
total debt increased by million from million at september  to million at september  the increase in revolver borrowings was primarily due to interest payments on the company s public debt

at september   the company had primary working capital of million  an increase of million from september   primarily due to increased trade receivables offset somewhat by increased trade payables 
the increase in trade receivables was primarily due to higher sales in fiscal compared to fiscal consolidation among major containerboard industry producers during the past to months has resulted in the mothballing of approximately percent of the domestic containerboard capacity 
this rationalization combined with limited new containerboard capacity additions and stable domestic demand growth has resulted in relatively balanced industry supply demand conditions 
during the early spring and mid summer of calendar  published prices of linerboard increased by per ton and per ton  respectively 
subsequently  the company implemented corresponding price increases for its corrugated products 
average delivered costs for wood chips decreased by approximately percent in fiscal compared to the prior year 
unusually wet weather in the southern us resulted in higher wood chip costs in fiscal average delivered prices for occ and dlk decreased approximately percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased demand 
fiber markets are difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance of the future direction of occ  dlk and wood chip prices 
on october   the company acquired the remaining percent share of s g packaging from its joint venture partner smurfit stone container corporation smurfit stone 
s g packaging is the largest us producer of retail paper grocery sacks and bags  consisting of six converting plants with annual sales of approximately million 
in connection with this transaction  the company paid smurfit stone million for its percent interest 
in addition  smurfit stone forgave million of its trade receivable for kraft paper sold to s g packaging 
the company also repaid  through borrowings on its revolver  approximately million oustanding on s g packaging s revolving loan facility  which was then terminated 
in connection with the acquisition  s g packaging entered into a paper supply agreement to purchase at market prices  tons   tons and  tons of kraft paper in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal through fiscal  respectively  from smurfit stone 
s g packaging s corporate staff will be integrated into the company s headquarters staff  providing cost savings associated with the elimination of duplicative functions 
the company also intends to move promptly to reduce costs by better aligning s g packaging s converting capacity with its customer needs 
the company currently estimates that it will spend approximately million implementing these actions over the next to months 
as of october   the company had approximately million of revolver borrowings outstanding and approximately million available under the revolving portions of its credit agreements 
based on current announced prices for converted products  current raw material costs and assuming maintenance levels of capital spending and including the projected impact of the acquisition of s g packaging  the company believes that cash provided by operations and borrowings available under its credit agreements will provide adequate liquidity to meet debt service obligations and other liquidity requirements over the next to months 
unless there is additional product price improvement  however  the company will need to seek additional covenant modifications to its bank credit agreement by the end of december to maintain continued access to its liquidity

year readiness disclosure the year issue refers generally to the potential problems that software and processing systems could encounter in determining the correct century for the year 
software and processing systems with date sensitive functions that are not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in system failures or the creation of erroneous results 
the company crossed the fiscal year end boundary at the end of september and its business systems are now operating in fiscal the company has experienced no major incidents related to the year the company developed a comprehensive  phased year readiness plan to address its internal systems that are comprised of both information technology it and non it systems 
the company s it and non it systems are comprised of computers and application software for financial and business management  electronic data interchange  process control and equipment monitoring  telecommunications  and environmental controls 
the plan included development of corporate awareness  assessment  implementation including remediation  upgrade  replacement  and deployment of certain products  validation testing  and contingency planning 
the company believes that  by modifying or upgrading existing systems  and or converting to new systems  the year issue can be resolved without material operational difficulties 
the company has incurred approximately million through fiscal to correct the year issue and expects to incur an additional million through the second quarter of fiscal the company has funded its year effort with cash from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit agreements 
the company has largely completed the awareness  assessment  remediation  implementation and testing activities for business critical items 
testing will continue on non business critical systems through the remainder of calendar it systems were verified for accuracy across the year boundary as well as other special calendar date situations 
a national consulting firm specializing in year issues assisted the company throughout the planning process and was retained to assist in the year verification testing 
the testing approach employed was intended to identify all potential problems with processing the year it is impractical to assure that all potential problems will be identified during these testing procedures 
therefore  the company may experience a greater than normal need for support activities immediately following the change to the year the it staff  with the assistance of designated outside vendor support  is prepared to react and correct these problems in a timely fashion  as it does with problems that occur in the normal course of business 
a consulting firm specializing in industrial controls developed an equipment inventory and assisted in the validation of equipment compliance for certain non it systems at the company s paper mills 
at its other facilities  internal resources  both operational and it staff  were used to inventory and to validate the non it systems 
all business critical non it systems used in the manufacturing and conversion processes have been remediated and verified 
the company believes that many of its customers  suppliers and financial institutions are also impacted by the year issue  which could affect the company 
the company has assessed the compliance efforts of a significant portion of the company s critical partners 
to date  no material deficiencies have been identified 
assessment activities will continue through the remainder of the year 
if the company s current or future customers  or suppliers  however  fail to achieve year compliance  the company believes that  due to lack of concentration of major customers or critical suppliers  results of operations  financial position or cash flow are not expected to be materially adversely affected 
the company has projected that the most likely worst case year scenario would be the result of unidentified year issues  which could result in unplanned downtime of production facilities at a rate higher than is normally experienced 
contingency plans have been developed to respond to the likelihood of these higher than normal system incidents 
any system failure which results in a business disruption is expected to be handled in a timely fashion  as would any normal day to day failures 
these potential disruptions are not expected to result in a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow
