item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general fx energy explores for oil  gas and gold in poland where it has oil and gas exploration rights in five separate project areas covering approximately million gross acres including million gross acres of concessions and million gross acres of options on pogc controlled areas and approximately  gross acres of gold exploration rights 
in the western united states  fx energy produces oil from fields in montana and nevada  has a drilling and well servicing company and approximately  net acres of undeveloped leaseholds in the williston basin of north dakota 
from its organization in january until the first quarter of  fx energy generated revenue principally from the sale of oil and gas prospects in the western united states and management fees from domestic exploration groups formed by fx energy 
during this period  fx energy reported substantial operating losses 
in the second quarter of  fx energy purchased certain producing oil properties in montana and nevada  well servicing equipment and a drilling rig capable of drilling up to  feet 
fx energy then realized increased operating revenues but continued to report operating losses 
since  when fx energy acquired oil and gas exploration rights to approximately million acres in the baltic project area in poland  fx energy has focused an increasing amount of resources and activities towards oil and gas exploration in poland 
as of january   fx energy had acquired oil and gas exploration rights  including concessions and options on pogc controlled areas  covering approximately million gross acres  resulting in fx energy owning the largest gross and net acreage position by a foreign company in poland 
fx energy has minimized its financial exposure in poland by forming strategic alliances with several industry partners such as apache  pogc  homestake and rwe dea 
fx energy realized net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock in the third quarter of the proceeds from the stock offering were used to pay off long term debt of million and to fund fx energy s exploration activities for the remainder of and all of and at the end of  fx energy had million in cash and marketable debt securities with no outstanding long term debt 
since its inception in through  fx energy has incurred cumulative net losses of million  including net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy may continue to incur net losses during and beyond  depending on results from its exploration and development activities in poland and the western united states 
results of operations by business segment fx energy operates within two segments of the oil and gas industry  exploration and production e p and drilling and well servicing drilling  and within the exploration segment of the mining industry 
in poland  fx energy explores for oil  gas and gold 
in the western united states  fx energy has a limited amount of exploratory acreage primarily in north dakota  produces oil montana and nevada and has a contract drilling and well servicing company in northern montana 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs dd a directly associated with the production and drilling segments are detailed within the following discussion 
general and administrative costs g a  interest income  other income  interest expense and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes and are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
mining  which consists of gold exploration on fx energy s sudety project area in poland  is not considered by management to be a material segment for the periods ended december   and as of the end of  fx energy had limited exploratory activity associated with gold exploration in poland  including  spent on gold exploration during and a gain from the sale of property interest of  during e p operations oil and gas exploration and production revenues oil revenues oil revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during and  fx energy s oil revenues were adversely affected by depressed oil prices and lower production rates attributable to the natural production declines of fx energy s producing properties 
a summary of the percentage change in oil revenues  average oil price and oil production for  and is set forth below year ended december  oil revenues    percent change versus prior year average oil price percent change versus prior year production volumes    bbls percent change versus prior year gain on sale of property interests fx energy recognized a gain on sale of property interests of  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
the gain on sale of property interests of  includes  relating to fx energy s mining operations  which are excluded from the discussion of the results of operations by business segment 
there was no gain from the sale of property interests in during  apache paid fx energy  in initial cash consideration relating to its participation in the carpathian project area which was offset by  of associated costs 
during  fx energy received  from apache in initial cash consideration relating to its participation in the lublin project area which was offset by  of associated costs and  from the purchase of lubex petroleum company  fx energy s wholly owned polish exploration subsidiary which operates the original blocks within fx energy s lublin project area 
the amount of gain on sale of property interests will continue to vary from year to year  depending on the timing of completed deals and the amount of up front cash consideration  if any 
exploration and production costs lease operating costs fx energy s lease operating costs are composed of normal recurring lease operating expenses loe and production taxes 
lease operating costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
loe costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy initiated a cost control program in to limit its loe costs  primarily by utilizing company owned well servicing equipment on its producing properties 
during  and fx energy performed only routine maintenance on its producing properties and has deferred workovers until the depressed oil price improves 
lifting cost per barrel was relatively flat during  and  amounting to  and per barrel  respectively 
production taxes were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and production taxes averaged approximately of annual oil revenues 
the decrease in the amount of production taxes from year to year is directly associated with decreased oil prices and decreased oil production from year to year

the dd a rate per barrel was relatively constant at  and for  and  respectively 
domestic proved property impairment as of december   fx energy s pv value for its domestic proved properties was approximately  consisting solely of proved developed reserves 
due to the current level of depressed oil prices  which fx energy expects to continue into the foreseeable future  management determined its domestic proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of will likely not be developed in the future and subsequently reported only domestic proved developed reserves at the end of in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  during the third and fourth quarters of  fx energy recorded total impairment expense of  which represents the difference between the net book value of its domestic proved developed properties and the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
fx energy did not record any impairment expense for its domestic proved properties during or exploration costs fx energy s exploration costs consist of geological and geophysical costs g g  exploratory dry holes and non producing leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the exploration costs of  include  of g g costs relating to fx energy s mining operations  which are excluded from the discussion of the results of operations for this segment 
a comparative discussion of each component of exploration costs incurred during  and follows g g costs were   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  fx energy incurred approximately  of cost relating to its share of the lublin project area seismic acquisition program with apache and  relating to the polish lowlands study 
during  fx energy completed a seismic survey on wola  a pogc concession in the southern carpathian area  costing  during  fx energy completed a seismic survey costing approximately  in the baltic project area 
during the years ended december   and fx energy spent an average of approximately  annually relating to the wages and associated expenses for employees and consultants directly engaged in g g activities 
fx energy has five project areas for oil and gas exploration in poland  including the warsaw west project area obtained january   the lublin  carpathian and pomeranian project areas obtained primarily in and the baltic project area obtained in g g costs are expected to continue at current or higher levels as fx energy increases its exploratory efforts in poland and continues to spend a limited amount on its exploratory acreage in the western united states 
exploratory dry hole costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all of the exploratory dry hole costs incurred during were associated with wells drilled prior to during  fx energy participated in drilling two exploratory dry holes  the czernic and the poniatowa  in poland on the lublin project area 
both wells were apache exploratory wells under fx energy s agreements with apache 
as such  apache covered all of fx energy s pro rata share of costs for each well 
during  fx energy drilled four exploratory dry holes  two in poland and two in the western united states 
in poland  fx energy drilled the orneta  the first exploratory oil well drilled by a western company in poland  at a cost of  and the gladysze a at a cost of  both of which were on fx energy s baltic project area 
in the western united states  fx energy drilled the murray in central montana at a cost of  and the mega springs federal in nevada at a cost of  in  fx energy drilled one exploratory dry hole in nevada costing  there were no non producing leasehold impairments during non producing leasehold impairments were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  fx energy wrote off  relating to its devil s basin prospect in central montana where the murray was drilled   relating to its mega springs prospect in nevada where the mega springs federal was drilled and  relating to its horse trap prospect in wyoming where fx energy no longer has drilling plans 
in  fx energy wrote off its lake valley prospect in nevada at a cost of  non producing leasehold impairments will vary from period to period based on fx energy s determination that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not realizable 
extraordinary gain baltic project area as of december   fx energy had  of long term debt associated with advances received from rwe dea relating to rwe dea s commitment to earn a fifty percent interest in fx energy s baltic project area 
during  rwe dea advanced fx energy an additional  bringing the total amount of such advances to  all of which fx energy recorded as notes payable prior to the polish government approving rwe dea s participation in fx energy s baltic project area 
on june   after the polish government had previously approved rwe dea s participation in the baltic project area  rwe dea elected not to earn an interest in fx energy s baltic project area 
fx energy was not contractually obligated to pay back any funds previously advanced by rwe dea 
accordingly  fx energy eliminated its long term debt associated with the rwe dea advances and recognized an extraordinary gain of  for the year ended december  fx energy did not record any extraordinary gains during or drilling and well servicing operations drilling revenues drilling revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  fx energy s drilling revenues consisted of  from drilling four wells in northern montana on a day work contract basis and  of well servicing revenue resulting from contracting fx energy s well servicing equipment to third parties 
fx energy had previously utilized its well servicing equipment solely on its company owned properties 
during  fx energy drilled two wells on a day work contract basis resulting in revenues of  and  from the murray and the state  respectively 
in addition to the drilling revenues received  fx energy had a working interest in the murray  a dry hole and a working interest in the state  an oil discovery 
a gross operating profit before dd a from drilling operations of  was realized during  consisting of  from drilling both wells  less  in downtime costs 
the drilling net profit helped offset the combined working interest well cost of  that fx energy incurred on these wells 
fx energy drilled one well during  resulting in revenues of  drilling revenues will continue to fluctuate year to year based on the number  timing and retained working interest of wells drilled and the degree of emphasis on utilizing well servicing equipment on company owned properties 
drilling costs drilling costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  fx energy drilled four wells costing a total of  on a day work contract basis  incurred  of cost relating to contract well servicing and  on downtime costs  all of which resulted in a total gross profit before dd a expense of  during  fx energy drilled two wells on a day work contract basis costing a total of  and incurred  of downtime costs  all of which resulted in a gross profit before dd a expense of  during  fx energy drilled one well on a day work contract basis costing  and incurred  of downtime  resulting in a net loss before dd a expense of  drilling costs will continue to fluctuate year to year based on the number  timing and retained working interest of wells drilled and the degree of emphasis on utilizing well servicing equipment on company owned properties

fx energy spent   and  on upgrading its drilling and well servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
dd a expense was progressively higher year to year due to prior year capital additions being depreciated in succeeding years 
results of operations non segmented information g a costs g a costs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
g a costs incurred during were substantially unchanged as compared to fx energy incurred substantially more g a costs associated with its expanded polish activities during as compared to  principally as a result of forming three new polish exploration subsidiaries  karpaty petroleum company  lubex petroleum company and sudety mining company 
during  fx energy incurred g a costs associated with its polish activities on the baltic project area only 
g a expenses are expected to continue at current or higher levels as fx energy further expands its presence in poland 
dd a expense corporate dd a expenses for corporate activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during and  fx energy spent approximately  on software to upgrade its accounting and exploration software systems and  on additional computer equipment  which resulted in progressively higher dd a expense for and interest and other income interest and other income were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fx energy s cash and marketable debt securities balance was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
interest and other income was lower in as compared to due to lower average cash and marketable debt security balances 
fx energy received net proceeds of million from a public stock offering in the third quarter of  which resulted in substantially higher cash balances for the remainder of and all of fx energy earned interest income of   and  during  and  respectively 
interest expense fx energy had no interest expense during the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  fx energy incurred interest expense of  and  respectively 
interest expense was lower during due to a lower average outstanding amount of long term debt in as compared to fx energy s long term debt of  was paid off in august using net proceeds from a public stock offering 
fx energy had long term debt associated with rwe dea of  as of december  and received  in additional funding from rwe dea during the first six months of  all of which was recorded as long term debt 
however  upon rwe dea s election not to earn an interest in the baltic project area on june   fx energy eliminated its long term debt associated with rwe dea and recognized an extraordinary gain of  as of december   fx energy had no long term debt 
income taxes fx energy incurred net operating losses in  and which can be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
fx energy s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of fx energy s exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in fx energy s conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  fx energy did not recognize any tax benefit in its consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   or net loss fx energy incurred net losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss in was due principally to a domestic proved property impairment of  g g costs of  and a decline in oil prices coupled with a decline in oil production 
the net loss in was due principally to g g costs of  an exploratory dry hole costing  drilled without an outside partner and leasehold impairments of  all of which resulted in expenditures without any substantial offsetting revenues 
the net loss in was due principally to g g costs of  and lease impairments of  capitalized costs for unproved oil and gas properties fx energy follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net revenues determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as a result of the foregoing  the results of operations of fx energy for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
polish project areas fx energy and apache ami effective january   fx energy and apache entered into an agreement which further defined the relationship between fx energy and apache in poland by establishing an ami covering the entire country of poland  except for the baltic project area  for oil and gas exploration  production  development and acquisition activities for a period of two years 
under agreements between fx energy and apache signed during  and early  apache has agreed to perform certain earning requirements in order to earn a fifty percent interest in fx energy s lublin and carpathian project areas 
a summary of the items for which apache must pay all of fx energy s pro rata share of costs during the first three years of a six year exploration period to earn a fifty percent interest in the lublin and carpathian project areas is as follows project area lublin carpathian total drilling costs wells wells wells completion costs wells wells d seismic  km km  km concession and usufruct    fees annual training costs    g a costs incurred in all through all through all through poland should an exploratory well discover commercial reserves  apache will be required to pay fx energy s pro rata share of completion costs for exploratory wells drilled on the lublin project area 
fx energy must pay for its pro rata share of any completion costs for exploratory wells drilled on the carpathian project area 
annual training cost amounts reflect expenditures required to be spent each year 
fx energy will not incur any of its pro rata share of apache s polish g a costs on the lublin or carpathian project areas until after apache fulfills its exploratory well drilling requirements on each of the respective project areas or the end of  whichever is later 
under other terms of the fx energy and apache ami  fx energy and apache are equal fifty fifty partners in the pomeranian and warsaw west project areas and apache is the operator of all project areas covered by the fx energy and apache ami 
during late  apache commenced drilling the first two exploratory wells  which were subsequently determined to be exploratory dry holes during february  and completed shooting its minimum requirement of  kilometers of d seismic on the lublin project area 
apache expects to drill the remaining five exploratory wells on the lublin project area by the end of  acquire kilometers of d seismic on the carpathian project area during and and drill three exploratory wells by mid on the carpathian project area 
option agreements with fx energy  apache and pogc fx energy and apache entered into agreements the option agreements with pogc during and whereby each has an independent reciprocal right to participate  with up to a one third interest  in hydrocarbon exploration of pogc controlled areas adjacent to and near the lublin  carpathian and pomeranian project areas 
in turn  pogc has the reciprocal right to participate in hydrocarbon exploration  with up to a one third interest determined on a block by block basis  on the lublin  carpathian and pomeranian project areas 
the option agreements cover approximately million acres of pogc controlled areas  including million acres on the lublin project area  million acres on the carpathian project area and million acres on the pomeranian project area and approximately million acres of fx apache controlled areas  including million acres on the lublin project area  million acres on the carpathian project area and million acres on the pomeranian project area 
the warsaw west and baltic project areas  containing approximately million and million acres  respectively  are not subject to any option agreements between fx energy  apache or pogc 
sudety project area agreement with homestake homestake and fx energy entered into a strategic alliance during to jointly explore for gold on fx energy s sudety project area with homestake as operator 
under terms of the agreement  homestake paid fx energy  and agreed to fund all concession costs  usufruct costs and future exploration costs  including spending a minimum of  during and exploring the sudety project area 
should homestake propose to construct a mine  fx energy may elect on a mine by mine basis to convert its interest into a six percent net smelter return royalty or a seven and one half percent net proceeds interest  both at no cost to fx energy  or into a twenty five percent working interest by paying back costs according to a predetermined formula 
baltic project area agreement with rwe dea in may  rwe dea and fx energy entered into an agreement to jointly explore for oil and gas on fx energy s baltic project area 
rwe dea was entitled to earn a fifty percent interest in the baltic project area by paying fx energy  in cash   for a seismic survey  the first  of the initial exploratory well s cost and fifty percent of the cost of the second exploratory well on the baltic project area with fx energy as operator 
formal approval by the polish government was required to effect the fifty fifty ownership between fx energy and rwe dea in the baltic project area 
prior to the polish government s approval in june  fx energy recorded all funds received from rwe dea as a long term notes payable 
through june   rwe dea advanced fx energy  to fund its agreed upon share of costs incurred in the baltic project area 
on june   rwe dea elected to not fund its fifty percent share of the second exploratory well 
as a result  rwe dea forfeited its right to earn a fifty percent interest in the baltic project area 
fx energy was not obligated to repay any of the advances it had received from rwe dea 
as a result  fx energy eliminated its long term notes payable associated with rwe dea and recognized an extraordinary gain of  during  fx energy drilled the orneta and the gladysze a wells in the baltic project area at a cost of  and  respectively  both of which were dry holes 
the orneta was drilled with rwe dea as a partner and the gladysze a was drilled without an industry partner 
future exploration efforts in the baltic project area will depend on whether or not fx energy is able to execute a strategic alliance with an industry partner 
liquidity and capital resources historically  fx energy has relied primarily on proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund its operating and investing activities 
during  and  fx energy received net proceeds from the sale of its securities  net of redemptions  of   and  respectively 
fx energy also benefits from funds provided by other participants in drilling groups formed by it to undertake specific drilling or other exploration activities 
operating activities fx energy used net cash of   and  to fund its operating activities during  and  respectively 
during  a major portion of fx energy s net cash used in operating activities resulted from spending  on exploration costs  which was comprised of  of g g costs and  of exploratory dry hole costs 
the net cash used in operating activities during was  less than the amount used during during  a major portion of fx energy s net cash used in operating activities resulted from spending  on exploration costs  which was comprised primarily of  of g g costs   of dry hole costs and  of non producing leasehold impairments 
the net cash used in operating activities during was  higher than the amount used during during  fx energy utilized its net cash used in operating activities to fund additional exploration and g a costs associated with expanding its activities in poland 
investing activities fx energy received net cash from investing activities of  and  during and  respectively  and used net cash of  during to fund its investing activities 
during  fx energy spent  on additions to properties  received  of proceeds from sale of property interests and received a net amount of  relating to investing in marketable debt securities 
the net cash received from investing activities during was  higher than the amount received during during  fx energy spent a net amount of  on additions to properties  which was partially offset by the net amount of  fx energy received relating to investing in marketable debt securities 
the net cash received from investing activities during was  higher than the amount used in during  fx energy spent  on additions to properties   on additions to other assets  realized  from asset sales and invested a net amount of  in marketable debt securities 
financing activities fx energy used net cash to fund financing activities of  during and received net cash of  and  during and  respectively  from its financing activities 
during  fx energy advanced  to officers and received  from the exercise of warrants and options on its common stock 
the cash used in financing activities during was  lower than the amount received during during  fx energy advanced  to an officer  realized  in advances from rwe dea and  from the exercise of warrants and options on its common stock 
the cash received in financing activities during was  lower than the amount received in during  fx energy received  in proceeds from long term debt  relating to rwe dea  paid off all of its other long term debt totaling  and realized net proceeds of  from sale of securities 
strategic alliances fx energy has benefited and anticipates that it will continue to benefit from strategic alliances with industry or financial partners to provide funding and expertise  which helps reduce fx energy s financial exposure and risk 
during the period of through  fx energy estimates that its strategic partners have paid or committed to carry approximately  of fx energy s share of costs in various projects 
in  apache committed to cover approximately  of fx energy s cost relating to exploring its lublin project area over approximately three years in exchange for a fifty percent percent interest in the project 
during early  apache committed to cover approximately  of fx energy s cost relating to exploring the southern carpathian project area over approximately three years in exchange for a fifty percent percent interest in the project 
also  during  homestake committed to paying approximately  of fx energy s cost over approximately two years relating to gold exploration on the sudety project area in poland 
rwe dea committed approximately  to cover fx energy s cost relating to the baltic project area during and other industry partners committed approximately  to cover fx energy s costs in other projects during and credit facility in june  fx energy established a million bank credit facility with bank one  texas  na  primarily to finance the acquisition of producing oil properties in montana and nevada 
during the third quarter of  fx energy used proceeds from a public offering to pay off its existing bank debt of  fx energy subsequently revised its credit facility with bank one in may to provide for an initial borrowing base of  and a revolving commitment of  fx energy did not utilize the credit facility during or and subsequently terminated the credit facility at the end of working capital fx energy had working capital of   and  as of december   and  respectively 
working capital as of december  was  lower as compared to the end of  primarily due to cash used in operating and financing activities of  and additions to properties of  during working capital was  lower as of december  as compared to the end of  primarily due to the net cash used for operating activities of  during the higher amount of working capital at the end of was attributable to the net amount of  received from the sale of securities during capital requirements fx energy had million of cash and marketable securities with no long term debt as of december   an amount which fx energy expects to be sufficient to fund its exploration and operating requirements 
however  fx energy does intend to seek additional capital to fund its activities in the lachowice field  and  as warranted  development activities on new polish projects that fx energy may enter into in the future and on existing projects in poland if exploration funded by apache results in discoveries warranting development 
exploration capital requirements during  fx energy expects to have substantially all the cost of its share of exploration activities covered by apache and other industry partners 
the primary focus for is expected to be in the lublin project area  where apache is expected to complete its requirement to drill the remaining five of seven exploratory wells  all at no cost to fx energy  to earn a fifty percent interest in the lublin project area 
in the carpathian project area  apache is expected to commence drilling the first of three exploratory wells in late  at no cost to fx energy  which are required for apache to earn a fifty percent interest in the carpathian project area 
initial exploratory efforts  which include new d seismic acquisition and the first exploratory well  are expected to occur in on the pomeranian project area and in on the warsaw west project area  where fx energy and apache are equal partners 
additional exploration of the baltic project area has been deferred until fx energy attracts another strategic partner 
in the sudety project area  homestake is paying for all gold exploration costs during in accordance with its agreement with fx energy 
due to the current state of depressed oil prices and its focus on poland  fx energy expects to incur minimal exploration expenditures on its domestic operations during development capital requirements development activity on the lachowice field is expected to commence during the second quarter of  with initial production scheduled for fx energy expects to spend approximately  per well for its pro rata share of costs to re enter and recomplete up to three shut in gas wells during  million per well to drill three additional development wells during and million for production facilities during the lachowice field development agreement  the first joint development agreement signed by western companies with pogc  established a legal framework for similar oil and gas development deals with pogc 
under the ami agreement with apache  fx energy and apache are now aggressively pursuing a series of such opportunities with pogc 
fx energy intends to seek additional funding for the lachowice field  and  as warranted  each polish development project it may inter into in the future 
due to the current state of depressed oil prices and its focus on poland  fx energy expects to incur minimal developmental expenditures on its domestic operations during and other capital requirement considerations the allocation of fx energy s capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures is discretionary and will depend upon future events that cannot be predicted 
such events include the actual results and costs of future exploration and development drilling activities 
consistent with previous practice  fx energy may obtain partial funding for its exploration and potential development activities through strategic arrangements with industry or financial partners 
in addition to fx energy s own expenditures and strategic alliances already established  fx energy expects it will continue to benefit from funding provided through its other exploration and development arrangements with strategic partners 
in forming strategic alliances with industry or financial partners  fx energy intends to seek reimbursement of all or a portion of the costs incurred by fx energy in identifying the prospect  obtaining initial exploration rights and generating an initial exploration plan 
fx energy s ability to form strategic alliances with industry or funding partners is dependent on the oil and gas potential of specific prospect areas  perceived political or business risks of the country and region in which the prospect is located  prevailing prices and other conditions in the oil and gas industry in particular and the energy industry in general and other factors which fx energy is unable to control or predict 
if the exploration activities in poland funded by apache result in one or more discoveries that warrant development  fx energy will likely require additional capital to fund its share of costs to undertake a multi well development program  install oil and or gas facilities  build pipelines and purchase other investments required to support large scale production 
in addition to its current activities underway  fx energy is actively seeking additional exploratory  development and property acquisition opportunities in cooperation with pogc and apache  which may also require additional capital 
fx energy has no current arrangement for any such additional financing  but may seek required funds from the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial property interests  strategic alliances with other energy or financial partners or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of existing shareholders in fx energy or fx energy s interest in the specific project financed 
there can be no assurance that additional funds could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms favorable to fx energy 
in order to maintain its interest in the lublin  carpathian  pomeranian  warsaw west  baltic and sudety project areas  fx energy is required to make certain annual payments and meet certain exploration commitments 
fx energy has budgeted sufficient funds and obtained financial commitments from apache and homestake to meet all of such obligations through at least december  fx energy also maintains its interests in leases in the united states not held by production by making annual lease payments  which are not material in amount 
see items and description of business and properties 
changing prices  currency exchange rates and inflation fx energy s revenues and the value of its oil properties have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil prices 
fx energy s ability to obtain exploration and or development capital through strategic alliances with other energy firms and attract additional capital  if required  through the sale of securities or borrowings on attractive terms are also affected by oil prices 
such prices are subject to substantial seasonal and other fluctuations that are beyond the ability of fx energy to control or predict 
in the past  fx energy has not hedged its oil production and has no future plans to do so 
although certain of fx energy s costs and expenses are affected by the level of inflation  inflation did not have a significant effect on fx energy s operations during  or fx energy customarily contracts for goods and services  including those related to seismic surveys and drilling  in us dollars to reduce the potential impact of inflation within poland 
fx energy s activities in poland may be affected by the rates of inflation in poland and other countries 
poland has experienced gradually decreasing inflation rates  estimated at approximately  and during  and  respectively 
the amounts in fx energy s agreements with apache  homestake and its other strategic partners and the government of poland relating to fx energy s activities in poland are expressed in us dollars 
nevertheless  fx energy s activities in poland may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the polish zloty  the us dollar and other currencies 
the exchange rate for the polish zloty was  and per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
in the past  fx energy has not hedged its foreign currency activities and has no future plans to do so 
year fx energy uses computers principally for administrative functions such as word processing  accounting  management reporting and financial forecasting 
fx energy also uses computers for scientific functions such as map making  geological interpretations and geophysical analysis 
substantially all of fx energy s principal computer systems have been purchased since fx energy s core software systems accounting  internet  word processing and spreadsheet and vendors are certified as year compliant 
an ongoing program has been implemented by fx energy to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by year software failures 
in addition to its own computer systems  in connection with its activities in the united states and in poland  fx energy interacts with suppliers  customers  creditors and financial service organizations domestically and globally which use computer systems 
fx energy is surveying all of the major businesses fx energy interacts with during the normal course of business and is requesting a certification of year compliance from each of them 
substantially all of fx energy s core vendors banking  insurance  stock market makers  strategic partners  oil purchasers  communications  etc 
have either already certified that they are year compliant or indicated they have a program underway to become year compliant before the year fx energy intends to modify or replace those systems  if any  which are not year compliant 
it is impossible for fx energy to monitor all such systems  particularly those of parties in another country
