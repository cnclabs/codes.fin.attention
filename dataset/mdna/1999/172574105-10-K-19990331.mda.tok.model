item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements reflecting circle s current expectations that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to such factors as economic and political conditions around the world  international laws  currency exchange rates  the effect of circle s accounting policies and other risk factors detailed herein and the impact year may have on information systems 
there can be no assurances that circle s actual future performance will meet such expectations 
there may also be important  unforeseen risks not described herein 
results of operations versus revenue in increased by million or over air freight forwarding revenue increased by million or over as a result of revenue increases in asia pacific and europe where circle handled higher kilo volumes and an increased number of shipments 
these increases were partially offset by revenue reductions in north america where circle handled less kilo volume and a reduced number of shipments due primarily to decreases in export activity to asia pacific 
ocean freight forwarding revenue increased by million or over as a result of increased revenue and shipments in asia pacific and europe 
circle s north america operations experienced lower volumes as well as a shift of export activity from asia pacific to other parts of the world  resulting in a revenue decrease 
customs brokerage and other revenue which includes warehousing  distribution and other logistics services  increased  or million over in europe there was higher import activity which was partially offset by lower import activity in asia pacific due to weakened local currencies 
warehousing and distribution  and other revenue increased in europe  north america  and asia pacific over the same period last year 
the gross revenue increase of million included a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately million resulting from converting foreign currency into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
net revenue in increased by million or over air freight forwarding net revenue increased by million or over as a result of improved margins in all regions and increased shipment volume in europe and asia pacific 
in north america  net revenue declined due to lower air freight revenue 
this reduction was substantially offset by more effective purchasing of transportation services 
although the result was lower net revenue  margins in north america improved by two percentage points 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased by million or over as a result of increased shipments and revenue in asia pacific and europe 
net revenue grew at a faster rate than revenue due to improved margins 
the net revenue increase of million included a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately million resulting from converting foreign currency into us dollars for financial reporting purposes

this increase included million of special charges related to merger integration costs for alrod international  inc  the write off of certain receivables at circle trade services as part of repositioning that business  certain charges related to latin america operations  facility consolidation  the write down of information technology assets and employee severance costs 
the remaining million increase was mainly due to an increase in occupancy costs related to additional warehousing and distribution facilities as well as an increase in professional fees and depreciation related to the upgrading of computer systems and relocation of the information technology group supporting the north america operations 
there were also higher communication costs across all regions  due to a higher volume of transactions 
in late  circle implemented cost reductions to partially offset the increased expenses from the expansion of its sales force and increased information technology costs 
the benefit of these reductions is expected to occur primarily during other income  net  decreased million 
income from affiliates decreased million primarily due to the effect of the downturn in the latin america and asia pacific economies on circle s automotive logistics affiliate 
the increase in interest  net  of million was attributable to income on irs tax refunds and to a reduction in circle s debt levels 
other  net  decreased million 
the effective income tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax benefit from the special charges was only 
this resulted in an overall increase in the tax rate for the year 
the effective tax rate for excluding the special charges was 
the increase from is a result of the favorable resolution of irs audits of the years through versus revenue in increased by million or over air freight forwarding revenue increased by million or over as a result of revenue increases in asia and the americas 
increases were due to higher kilo volumes and increased number of consolidation export shipments  offset slightly by lower direct agency shipments

customs brokerage and other revenue increased million or over the improvement was a result of increases in the number of customs entries processed and in warehousing and distribution services 
net revenue in increased by million or over air freight forwarding net revenue increased million or over the prior year due to an increase in the number of shipments in asia and the americas

other income  net  increased million or from prior year primarily due to strong earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates and higher foreign exchange gains resulting from us dollar denominated transactions in asia 
these gains were partially offset by higher minority partner expense associated with our consolidated joint ventures as well as lower interest income and higher interest expense due to the sale of marketable securities during and additional debt incurred in the third quarter of to acquire of tds logistics  inc the effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
circle s effective tax rate fluctuates due to changes in foreign tax rates and regulations and the level of pre tax profit in foreign countries 
in  circle benefited from the favorable resolution of irs audits of the years through  resulting in net refunds in excess of amounts previously anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources and net cash provided by operations increased to million for the year ended december   from million in cash used in investing activities decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to proceeds from sales of investments of million in compared to purchases of million in in addition  in circle used cash of million to acquire businesses 
long term notes payable decreased million 
this is primarily due to a reduction in commercial paper issued and outstanding by million  from million as of december   to million as of december  this reduction was partially offset by acquired mortgage liabilities in conjunction with circle s concord acquisition in singapore 
net working capital at december   was million compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the timing of receipts and disbursements 
the fluctuations in individual components is largely due to acquisitions 
circle makes significant disbursements on behalf of its customers for transportation costs and customs duties 
the billings to customers for these disbursements  which are several times the amount of revenue and fees derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenue and expense on circle s income statement  but are reflected in circle s trade receivables and trade payables 
capital expenditures for circle during were million and were funded by working capital 
circle expects to increase capital expenditures by to during as a result of increased investment in information technology

new accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements 
year general discussion the following discussion of the implications of the year problem for circle contains forward looking statements based on inherently uncertain information 
the cost of year compliance and the date on which circle plans to complete its year modifications are based on circle s best estimates  which were derived utilizing a number of assumptions of future events including the continued availability of internal and external resources  third party modifications and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ 
moreover  although circle believes it will be able to make the necessary modifications in advance  there is no assurance that failure to modify the systems would not have a material adverse effect on circle 
circle relies on several internal systems to support its freight forwarding  customs brokerage  logistics management and warehouse management systems worldwide 
circle is also reliant upon system capabilities of customs offices  business partners  trading partners  customers  suppliers and governmental agencies in many countries around the world 
circle places a high degree of reliance on computer systems of such third parties 
although circle is assessing the readiness of these third parties and preparing contingency plans  there can be no guarantee that the failure of these third parties to modify their systems in advance of december   would not have a material adverse effect on circle 
readiness a year program management office has been established to provide overall direction of circle s year efforts worldwide 
internal management reporting requirements have been established 
plans and progress against those plans are reviewed by the year program management office and are reported to the chief information officer and the board of directors 
the core business systems that support circle in each geographic region have been assessed for year compliance and are undergoing upgrades to become year compliant 
these upgrades to core business systems  including testing and certification  are expected to be completed by september circle has plans for a comprehensive site validation that will result in a year readiness health check of all computing resources and non it devices located in branch offices worldwide 
mission critical branch office systems and mission critical devices are expected to be renovated or replaced by september circle has accelerated its communication with third parties to determine the extent to which circle s systems are vulnerable to the non compliance of these third party systems 
contact information for various customs offices will be gathered and year efforts of customs offices will be closely monitored 
circle plans to conduct systems testing with business partners  trading partners  suppliers and key governmental agencies during calendar year additionally  circle is participating with software vendors user groups in year testing of the three core business systems used by circle 
there is no certainty that the systems of various third parties will be compliant  and there is some likelihood that the systems of third parties such as overseas governmental agencies will not be year ready 
costs because of the potential overall impact of year on circle  circle has adopted a centralized corporate strategy to address the year problem 
this corporate strategy is budgeted and managed from headquarters and is the responsibility of the chief information officer 
year costs are estimated to be between and million through the end of with an additional to million estimated for post year work that is deemed non mission critical 
approximately million of this estimate is allocated to testing  including end to end testing with business partners  trading partners  critical suppliers and governmental agencies 
approximately million is allocated to business contingency planning 
the expected funding of all year costs is through cash flows from operations 
included in the estimated costs for year readiness are the costs of the year health check to assess branch office systems and non it devices  the replacement of mission critical devices  the replacement or modification of application software and the implementation of contingency plans 
actual costs as of december  as of december   circle has spent approximately million in costs specifically directed to the year remediation 
this amount does not include costs incurred in the development of new systems or systems replacement that assisted in the retirement of non compliant code 
risks because of the significant reliance on the systems of third parties unaffiliated with circle  there can be no assurance that circle will not experience some disruption in its systems 
in circle s opinion  there is likely to be some interruption in services as a result of non compliance by third parties 
in the event circle s systems or the systems of third parties that are critical to circle s business are not year compliant by january   circle s business performance may be adversely affected 
certain of circle s systems may need to operate in a manual mode for some limited time 
circle will work closely with customers and business partners to minimize the impact of manual operations on service levels 
circle believes the greater risk is with the potential non compliance of third party systems  a risk which is inherent to the industry 
circle is unable to estimate the financial impact of the risks stated above 
however  circle believes that its initiatives to solve the year problem  and a comprehensive business contingency plan  should reduce the possibility of a material adverse effect on business operations 
of all the external risks  circle believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be a business disruption resulting from an extended communications failure 
with its extensive use of technology  circle is dependent upon data and voice communications to receive  process  track and bill customer orders 
based on circle s information regarding the readiness of communication carriers  as well as circle s contingency plans  circle expects that any such disruption would be localized and of short duration 
contingency planning contingency planning for business continuity is led by a member of corporate senior management 
each geographic region s contingency plans will reflect the areas of risk that are unique to a particular region or country 
each branch  country and region will be required to prepare a detailed contingency plan and procedures that address the following communication plan  priority operations and performance thresholds  emergency instructions for extended outages includes activation of a hot site  special security instructions  identification of responsibilities recovery team director  recovery team command center  command center coordinator  recovery team leaders  recovery team members  damage assessment teams  plan activation process notification and activation authority  identification of minimum infrastructure capabilities to operate a location computer hardware  network infrastructure  software  physical facilities  utilities  vendor support  personnel and embedded systems  assure on hand inventories of mission critical supplies  an assessment of the organization s direct suppliers to determine those that are high risk  identification of the weak link in each critical supply chain 
euro conversion circle is engaged in various efforts worldwide related to the introduction in january of the european single currency known as the euro 
circle does not believe that the euro will have a material impact on the competitiveness of its services in europe 
circle believes that its current accounting systems will accommodate the euro conversion with minimal intervention and does not expect to experience material adverse tax consequences as a result of the conversion 
based on the results of its efforts to date  management believes that the internal and external costs incurred to address the euro conversion will not have a material impact on the operations  cash flows or financial condition of circle 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk discussion circle s cash flow and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
circle attempts to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
circle provides services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  has a well diversified range of functional currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  asia  the south pacific and europe 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the earnings effect of potential changes in value of circle s local currency denominated revenues 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of intercompany obligations two times per month 
in addition  certain exposures are managed by financial market transactions in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts typically with maturities of twelve months or less 
forward foreign exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the receivable or payable being covered  and the term of the forward foreign exchange contract matches the term of the underlying receivable or payable 
circle covers known and measurable exposed receivables and payables denominated in currencies that have a liquid  cost effective forward foreign exchange market  and that are of sufficient size to warrant such coverage 
the receivables and payables being covered arise from trade and intercompany transactions of and among circle s operating units and intercompany loans among circle s operating and other business units 
circle does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on circle s consolidated net income 
circle does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates because of the low levels of marketable securities and the amount and term of debt on circle s balance sheet 
circle does not undertake any specific actions to cover its exposure to interest rate risk and circle is not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
circle does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
exchange rate sensitivity circle s use of derivative financial instruments is limited to forward foreign exchange contracts 
at december   the nominal value of all open forward foreign exchange contracts was million related to seven transactions denominated in us dollars  australian dollars  japanese yen and british pounds 
a appreciation or depreciation against the us dollar of any or all of the underlying currencies would not have a material effect on circle s net income 
the following table provides information about circle s non functional currency components of balance sheet items by currency  and presents such information in us dollar equivalents 
the table summarizes information on transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates is then subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency 
non functional currency exposure in us dollar equivalents as of december  in thousands foreign exchange gain loss if functional currency non functional net exposure appreciates depreciates currency asset liability long short by by united states dollar      swiss franc singaporean dollar irish punt german mark indian rupee british pound italian lira dutch guilder all others  totals
