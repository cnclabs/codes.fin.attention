item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this review contains management s discussion of the company s operational results and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
overview medimmune commenced operations in april and  through  revenue was generated solely from research and development agreements and research grants 
in  contract revenues rose substantially and the company began selling its first product  cytogam  to an exclusive distributor 
in december  the company reacquired the cytogam marketing rights from its distributor and launched an expanded marketing program for this product through its own sales force in january on january   the company s second product  respigam  was licensed for marketing by the us food and drug administration fda for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv in children under months of age with bpd or a history of pre maturity 
on june   the company s second generation rsv drug  synagis  was approved for marketing by the fda and the company s gaithersburg pilot plant facility was licensed for production of synagis 
synagis is approved in the us for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by rsv in pediatric patients at high risk for rsv disease 
because of the seasonal nature of rsv  limited sales  if any  are expected during the second and third quarters of any calendar year  causing results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
on november   the company s board of directors authorized a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend payable december  accordingly  all share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect this stock split 
results of operations compared to product sales increased for the year ended december  over the year ended december  due primarily to demand for synagis  launched in sales of synagis generally will be expected to occur each year in proximity to the rsv season  from september through march 
synagis sales  commenced in september and were million for the year 
of those sales  million were sales to abbott international  the company s exclusive distributor outside the us  for named patient sales of synagis 
as of december  the company and abbott international have filed international registrations in countries for approval of synagis 
there can be no assurance that approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities will be granted 
respigam sales decreased to million in from million in respigam sales in primarily reflect sales for the end of the season  as most customers had switched to synagis for the beginning of the season 
net sales for respigam in include an adjustment of million recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting actual and expected product returns as a result of the shift in demand from respigam to synagis 
the company estimates that there will be limited usage of respigam over the remainder of the rsv season and that usage in the rsv season will be limited 
sales of cytogam increased to million in from million in domestic units sold increased by and international units sold increased by 
cytogam is sold at a lower selling price to international distributors than domestic units 
the increase in domestic units sold reflects both an increase in the core business for cytogam and substitution occurring as a result of the worldwide shortage of standard intravenous immune globulin ivig products 
the duration of this shortage and continued impact  if any  on cytogam sales cannot be determined at this time 
the company also received in december  fda approval for the use of cytogam in kidney  lung  liver  pancreas and heart transplants 
the company does not expect the approval to significantly affect future sales in the us as many physicians have already been prescribing cytogam s use in the settings of solid organ transplantation 
the increase in international cytogam sales reflects a greater focus on this market as well as the effects of the worldwide shortage of ivig products 
the level of future product sales will be dependent on several factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and extent of future regulatory approvals of the company s products and product candidates  availability of finished product inventory  approval and commercialization of competitive products and the degree of acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace 
other revenue increased to million in from million in revenues in include a million milestone payment from abbott laboratories abbott received upon fda approval of synagis  and million of funding from smithkline beecham sb in connection with the hpv vaccine development collaboration  including a million milestone payment that was due upon signing of the agreement 
other revenues in consist primarily of a million payment made by abbott in connection with the signing of the international distribution agreement 
the company would also become entitled to receive an additional million from abbott if marketing approval for synagis is obtained in europe 
the level of contract revenues in future periods will depend primarily upon the extent to which the company enters into other collaborative contractual arrangements  if any  and the extent to which the company achieves certain milestones provided for in its existing agreements 
cost of sales of million was recorded in versus million in  an increase of 
factors impacting cost of sales include a charge of million related to the writedown of respigam inventory and by product inventory  offset by credits for the reversal of previously recorded respigam royalties expected to be due to massachusetts health research institute mhri 
excluding the respigam inventory writedown and the royalty adjustments from cost of sales and excluding the respigam returns from product sales  gross margins improved to in from in  reflecting the change in product mix towards synagis  which has a lower cost than cytogam and respigam 
the company s products are primarily manufactured by third parties and future per unit cost of sales could increase if the company is unable to negotiate favorable pricing 
the company has completed construction of its own manufacturing facility intended for the production of some portion of two of its approved products as well as potentially for other product candidates if approved for marketing 
this facility is subject to inspection and approval by the fda and any resulting sales of product from this facility would not commence for at least the next to months 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  or  reflecting primarily million of expenses in for conducting the company s  patient phase synagis clinical trial 
no large phase trials were conducted in the level of research and development spending in future periods will fluctuate depending on the extent of clinical trial spending and the level of investment in new or existing programs 
the company expects higher clinical trial expenses in  as it continues to move new product candidates into the clinic  and continues testing of products already in clinical trials 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in a significant portion of the increase in expenses in reflects payments expected to be due to the ross products division of abbott for co promotion of synagis and approximately million of marketing expenses for the launch of synagis 
additionally  sg a reflects increased spending over for increased distribution costs resulting from synagis sales as well as for added headcount and facilities needed to handle growth in the company s operations 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in will be significantly impacted by the level of synagis sales  due to the nature of the threshold based co promotion agreement with abbott 
other operating expenses were million in versus million in  an increase of 
this increase is primarily a result of increased wages and supply costs as the frederick manufacturing facility increased staffing levels in  increased consulting costs for plant validation and start up activities  and a million charge for the buydown of certain synagis royalty obligations prior to fda approval in june other operating expenses are expected to continue to be significant in and into as the company continues start up and validation activities at the frederick plant 
interest income increased to million for from million in reflecting higher cash balances available for investment  including the proceeds from the company s private placement of stock in january resulting in net proceeds of million  offset by a decrease in interest rates which lowered the overall portfolio yield 
interest expense of million was recorded in versus million in  reflecting primarily interest on the company s convertible debt net of amounts capitalized and interest on equipment financing beginning in june interest expense in and is net of million and million  respectively  of interest capitalized for the manufacturing facility and the pilot plant expansion 
the company s convertible debt is callable in july if the convertible debt is called or converted  interest expense is expected to decrease substantially in the second half of the company recorded an overall net income tax benefit of million in as a result of a reversal of the company s valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
the company believes that it is now more likely than not that such benefit will ultimately be utilized

basic earnings per share in were on million shares 
diluted earnings per share were on million shares 
basic and diluted loss per share was in on million shares 
the company does not believe inflation had a material effect on its financial statements 
these results were consistent with the company s objectives for the year and with the continued development of its immunotherapeutic and vaccine products 
the factors that affected results may continue to affect near term future financial results 
compared to product sales increased for the year ended december   over the year ended december   due to increased demand for respigam in the first half of the product s second full season of sales  as well as a increase in cytogam sales 
respigam sales were million in versus million in  a increase  reflecting an increase in vials sold 
supply constraints limited sales 
cytogam product sales increased to million from million in due primarily to a increase in units sold  and two price increases that took effect in mid and mid in cytogam product sales were reduced by a million reserve for trade receivables due from a pharmaceutical wholesaler that filed chapter bankruptcy in august  million was recovered against this loss in as a result of a sale of the receivables to a third party 
other revenues increased to million in from million in other revenues in reflect primarily fees paid by abbott laboratories for the right to distribute synagis outside the us other revenues in reflect the completion of milestone and research funding payments under the company s strategic alliance with ahp  formerly american cyanamid company 
under the terms of the alliance  the company and ahp share in the profits or losses of respigam  reimbursements or payments under this arrangement are deducted from or added to operating expenses and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in  due to a increase in vials sold 
gross margins in improved to versus in  reflecting the increased sales of respigam in the product mix  which has a lower royalty rate than cytogam 
margins were adversely impacted by a charge for an estimate of additional royalties due to mhri as part of a possible settlement of an ongoing inquiry by the inspector general of the commonwealth of massachusetts 
the charges were reversed in as the matter was substantially resolved without financial impact to the company 
research  development and clinical costs of million were incurred in compared to million in  an increase of

expenses also include million in license fees relating to synagis and medi  a monoclonal antibody that inhibits t cell responses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in reflects primarily ahp s share of respigam s profits  which resulted in a charge of million to selling expenses as calculated under the terms of the strategic alliance

other selling and marketing expenses increased by million  reflecting increased commission and product distribution costs resulting from the increased product sales

year the company has established a year project team comprised of representatives from key functional areas to complete a review of its internal and external systems for year readiness 
the year issue is expected to affect the systems of the company and various entities with which the company interacts  including the company s marketing partners  suppliers and various vendors 
the year project is designed to address three major areas information technology systems  hardware  equipment and instrumentation  including embedded systems  and third party relationships 
the company s plan involves inventorying  assessing and prioritizing those items which have year implications  remediating repairing  replacing or upgrading non compliant items  testing items with major exposure to ensure compliance  and developing contingency plans to minimize potential business interruption 
the inventory  assessment and prioritization phases of the project are substantially complete 
with regard to the company s information technology systems  hardware  equipment and instrumentation  the company has identified mission critical and non critical items and is in the process of updating and or replacing items that are non compliant 
the company believes that it should be able to substantially complete implementation of critical aspects of its year plan prior to the commencement of the year because the company has relied primarily on off the shelf software for its information technology needs and because much of the hardware  equipment and instrumentation is currently compliant  the company does not anticipate that the costs for internal remediation efforts will be significant 
the company does not separately track the internal costs of its year compliance efforts and therefore these costs are unknown 
as of december   the company estimates that it has spent no more than  replacing  upgrading or repairing the systems and or equipment that are non compliant and expects the cost to complete these efforts should not exceed  the company presently anticipates that its remediation efforts will be substantially complete by june  testing of certain business critical items is expected to be completed by the third quarter in addition to the risks associated with the company s own computer systems and equipment  the company has relationships with  and is in varying degrees dependent upon  a large number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to the company 
these include  but are not limited to  third party manufacturers  suppliers  customers  and distributors 
the company has identified those third parties with which the company has material relationships to assess their year readiness 
the company has distributed surveys and or contacted these parties to aid in this assessment 
for mission critical functions  the company intends to visit third parties to assess their year readiness 
the company may also be affected by the failure of other third parties to be year compliant even if they do not do business directly with the company 
for example  the failure of state  federal and private payors or reimbursers to be year compliant and thus unable to make timely  proper or complete payments to sellers and users of the company s products  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the government accounting office has stated that the health care financing administration  the principal federal reimburser for the company s marketed products  may not become fully year compliant on a timely basis 
the company does not currently have a year contingency plan established 
the company expects by mid to have finalized a contingency plan which will address the most likely worst case year scenario 
the company believes that its most likely worst case scenario would be delays in product shipments due to a complete or partial manufacturing shutdown 
to mitigate this risk  the company plans  among other things  to stock extra inventory 
with regard to the company s year readiness plan  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to identify all aspects of its business that are subject to year problems  including issues of its customers or suppliers  that the company s software vendors  third parties and others will be correct in their assertions that they are year ready  that the company s estimate of the cost of year readiness will prove ultimately to be accurate  that the company will be able to successfully address its year issues and that this could result in interruptions in  or failures of  certain normal business activities or operations that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

the company s contract for the purchase of synagis from bi is denominated in german marks 
in an effort to reduce the impact of fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the german mark on the cost of the company s purchases of synagis  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts 
these contracts permit the company to purchase german marks  in an amount the company believes will be sufficient to fund its inventory purchase obligations  at a fixed exchange rate 
each contract terminates on the day the company expects to make payment for a shipment of synagis 
the company does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the table below provides information about the company s foreign exchange forward contracts 
the anticipated purchase amount is the amount  in german marks dm  that the company is contractually obligated to pay bi 
the contract amount is the sum of all of the company s forward contracts during the period indicated 
the forward contract exchange rate is the rate at which the company has agreed to purchase german marks upon termination of the contract
