overview the company achieved record earnings for the fifth consecutive year in and the third consecutive year as a publicly traded company 
net income in amounted to million  of sales  compared to million in revenue was million in  compared to million in the company did not meet management s revenue expectations in primarily because the award of a follow on department of defense contract was delayed until september and because completion of the nebula fault tolerant network switch has been delayed until the second quarter of the company s financial performance improved significantly during the second half of sales during the second half of the year were higher than in the first half and diluted earnings per share were  compared to  higher 
at year end  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents per share and virtually no debt 
for  the company generated income from operations  excluding depreciation and amortization ebitda of million and cash from operating activities amounted to million  compared to million for return on equity for was and return on assets was 
during  international sales increased to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in as the company enters  management is focusing on the development and delivery of new products for two distinct communications markets wide area networking communications and local area network switching 
wide area networking the company s overall wide area networking strategy is to provide customers with hardware and software product solutions which support a variety of open system platforms and operating systems 
the growth in the wide area networking wan communications market is being driven by the expansion of the internet  cellular communications and the convergence occurring between data communications and telecommunications 
at the same time  the technologies for wide area networking products are changing dramatically 
server  workstation  and telecommunications providers are migrating their platforms and applications from older bus standards such as vmebus and sbus  to the newer standard hardware bus architectures  pcibus and compactpci 
these technology changes offer a significant opportunity for the company 
pti began developing wan communications products for the pcibus market in in  pcibus products represented less than of the company s wan revenue 
through a combination of internal development  licensing and strategic partnering  the company created a comprehensive group of wide area networking communications products for this market 
during and  pti wan product revenue increased by and pcibus products represented of the company s wan revenue in the next emerging wan market the company is addressing is compactpci cpci 
cpci is a new standard hardware bus architecture that combines the attributes of the vmebus and pcibus into a ruggedized industrial hardware system for the embedded oem marketplace 
the telecommunications and defense industries are expressing great interest in the cpci system architecture for meeting their application requirements 
currently  the company s cpci wan products are being evaluated for numerous potential integration opportunities and we expect shipments of cpci products in the second half of to complement the company s hardware development  communication software protocols have been developed for the pcibus and cpci product lines including frame relay  signaling system ss  x  high level data link control hdlc and a variety of protocols to facilitate high and low speed communications 
the markets and applications for wide area network products are expanding rapidly 
in order to gain broader market penetration  the company established strategic partnering relationships with a number of major server  workstation and telecommunications equipment suppliers including sun microsystems  compaq computers  nortel networks and adc newnet  as well as several leading compactpci platform manufacturers 
local area network switching the company has been developing its second generation family of high performance mbit gigabit network switches for local area networks 
during  the company completed development of its new nebula tm workgroup switch and its new nebula high density departmental switch 
the centerpiece of the company s local area network switch strategy is the nebula fault tolerant backbone switch 
this ethernet switch is the first network switch to offer true fault tolerance at an affordable price 
the nebula s redundant switch fabric has been engineered for maximum availability and its innovative design ensures that no single point of failure will shutdown a network 
the market demands for fault tolerant computing and networking are rising rapidly 
server manufacturers including compaq computers and tandem computers have developed server clusters to meet their customers fault tolerant server requirements 
networking companies including novell are actively promoting and selling networking solutions for mission critical applications 
management believes that deployment of its fault tolerant technologies in the new nebula backbone switch differentiates pti from the other vendors in the network switching marketplace 
this new product is being positioned for ethernet based business and mission critical applications in enterprises where round the clock operations demand highly resilient network infrastructures 
prospective customers in the banking  brokerage  medical imaging and defense industries are expressing serious interest in this product 
as of march  the nebula was operating in a number of early beta sites  including the company s communications network 
additional beta sites have been selected and units are expected to be installed in these locations in april and may 
shipments to customers are expected to commence in the second quarter 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of sales and is included as an aid to understanding the company s results and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report year ended december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes and minority interest 
provision for income taxes minority interest net income year ended december   compared with the year ended december  sales 
sales for were  compared to  in the company s sales are in one product segment and are grouped into five product categories wan communications products  lan interface products  network systems products  mass storage interface products and inter system connectivity products 
beginning in  sales will be grouped into four product categories wan communications products  lan interface products  network switching and other combining network systems products  mass storage interface products and inter system connectivity products 
shipments of wan communications products represented of sales during  compared to in the increase in wan sales is primarily attributable to the development of several new pcibus products being sold to customers including sun microsystems  compaq computers and adc newnet 
during  the company experienced a decline in vmebus and sbus revenue as customers moved to newer technologies 
the company has developed several new wan products for the compactpci market and these products are in evaluation by numerous telecommunications and defense suppliers 
management expects pcibus and compactpci revenue to increase in while the vmebus and sbus revenue declines as these technologies become less prevalent 
shipments of lan interface products amounted to of sales in and the largest share of the company s lan interface product business is generated from commercial off the shelf cots department of defense projects 
defense project revenue declined in by because the award of a significant multi year contract was delayed until mid september and interim orders were not received during the delay period 
also in the third quarter of  a significant contract was received from a new oem customer for pcibus lan products 
pcibus products represented almost of lan revenue in  versus in revenue from this oem customer could approach million in shipments of network systems products represented of sales in  compared to in network systems are primarily comprised of shipments of i o subsystems to an oem customer and sales of specialized communication server hardware and protocol software for specialty wan applications 
as anticipated  shipments to the oem customer declined by approximately million in and sales of specialized communication servers also declined in the engineering staff supporting the server business was reassigned at the beginning of to develop software for wan communications products 
a further decline in network systems product revenue is expected in and beyond 
shipments of mass storage interface products for amounted to of sales  compared to in the technologies used in this market are moving from sbus to pcibus and from scsi to fibre channel 
the pcibus market has become a commodity market with greater competition and lower pricing 
while this market was also moving to the fibre channel technology  there were delays in the adoption of standards 
as a result of these factors  the company s pcibus and fibre channel products do not effectively compete in today s market 
a further decline in mass storage product revenue is forecasted in and beyond 
shipments of inter system connectivity products represented of sales in compared to of sales in the company is not investing in this group of products and a declining trend for this revenue is expected 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including materials costs  manufacturing expenses and amortization of software development costs 
gross profit in increased by  to  from  in gross margin improved to of sales in  from in while gross margin for the company s wan  lan interface and other products is expected to average or in  the gross margin on the new network switching products is forecasted to average approximately for the year because the company intends to aggressively price these products in the market 
total operating expenses 
total operating expenses remained relatively constant at of sales in and the company increased its investment in research and development during  while controlling selling and marketing expenses and reducing its general and administrative expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to  in  from  in  of sales in and during  the company delayed certain planned marketing and promotional activities associated with the nebula in order to coordinate spending with the product s availability 
during the second half of  the sales and marketing staff for the network switch group was increased in order to have a greater impact on sales in management intends to market its new products aggressively in and expects sales and marketing expenses to increase as a percentage of sales 
research and development expenses increased by to  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in recruiting and hiring engineers continues to be one of the company s greatest challenges 
while a number of engineers were hired during  the company continues to actively recruit to fill open positions and has engaged outside engineering consultants to assist on new product development projects 
the increase in research and development expenses in was primarily the result of new engineers hired  outside engineering consultants  and higher development costs for new products 
management believes research and development expenses can fluctuate quarterly during but will only increase modestly as a percentage of sales for the year 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  or of sales in  compared to  or of sales in while the company maintains tight control over its general and administrative expenses  more than one half of the expense reduction was associated with the company not achieving the internal growth goals and objectives established in the company s annual incentive plan 
management believes general and administrative expenses should decline as a percentage of sales in other income  net

the funds are primarily invested in high quality municipal and us treasury securities with maturities of less than one year 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for is based upon the combined federal and state effective tax rate of  compared to in year ended december   compared with the year ended december  sales 
sales for increased by  to  from  for the company s products are grouped into five categories wan interface adapter products  lan interface adapter products  network systems products  mass storage interface products and inter system connectivity products 
shipments of wan interface adapter products amounted to of sales during  compared to for this increase is attributable to introductions over the last twelve to eighteen months of several new wan products and several new oem customers integrating these products into their product applications 
shipments of lan interface adapter products for amounted to of sales  compared to for the largest share of the company s lan business is generated from commercial off the shelf cots defense applications which is project oriented and is difficult to predict on a quarterly basis 
combined wan and lan sales grew by in and represented of the company s business in the fourth quarter of shipments of network systems products represented of total sales in and for network systems are primarily comprised of shipments of i o subsystems to a major oem customer and specialty protocol software business sold by the company s subsidiary  uconx corporation 
during the first nine months of  shipments of the i o subsystem to this customer represented million of revenue 
due to what appears to be a slowdown in orders for the customer s product that incorporates the company s i o subsystem product  this customer requested delays of its fourth quarter deliveries and has not placed any orders for product deliveries for the first half of the specialty software protocol business is typically project oriented which can result in fluctuations 
the volume of this business in was less than originally forecasted and at the end of  the company integrated the uconx organization into its corporate structure 
the products and services of uconx will continue to be sold but future engineering efforts will be more focused on pti s wan projects 
shipments of mass storage interface products for amounted to of sales  compared to in the decrease in sales volume is believed to be attributable to a slow down in the raid disk drive market primarily associated with the pacific rim economic issues in the fourth quarter and technology changes occurring in this market 
these changes include customers transitioning from sbus to pcibus applications and from the slower scsi adapters to faster fibre channel adapters 
the company has been transitioning its products and customers into these new technologies  however  the decline in the sbus business has been greater than the increase in the pci business 
shipments of inter system connectivity products represented of sales and of total sales the company is not investing in this group of products and a declining trend in these revenues is expected 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including materials costs  manufacturing expenses and amortization of software development costs 
gross profit for increased by  to  from  for due to increased sales volumes 
gross margin percentage improved to of sales for  from in the improved margin is attributable to favorable product mix along with manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher sales volumes 
total operating expenses

spending for marketing and promotion increased in as compared to  primarily due to the costs incurred to introduce the new switching products and to improve the company s presence in the marketplace 
research and development expenses increased by to  or of sales for  compared to  or of sales for research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits costs  cost of materials consumed in developing and designing new products and  to a lesser extent  contract development 
certain engineering expenses associated with the development of software are capitalized and amortized to cost of goods sold 
the increase in research and development expenses in was primarily attributable to the hiring of eight additional engineers and the development of the new asic for the new switching products 
the company needs to continually invest in new product development to stay abreast of technological changes in its markets 
general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales for  or  compared to  or of sales for the decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to maintaining control of administrative expenses 
other income  net 
other income consists primarily of interest income from cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the funds are primarily invested in money market funds  high quality short term commercial paper and us treasury securities maturing in less than months 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for is based upon the combined federal and state effective tax rate of  compared to in the primary reasons for the increase in the combined tax rate are the higher research and development tax credits generated in and a lower benefit of state income taxes in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s primary source of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of  and available borrowings of  under a revolving credit facility with a bank 
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of december  the company had working capital of  at december   compared to  at december  cash generated by operating activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash generated from operating activities in is attributable to greater net income and non cash adjustments offset by a net increase in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by investing activities was  in and cash used in investing activities was  and  in and  respectively 
during  investing activities included the purchase of marketable securities of  the maturity of marketable securities of  and capital equipment purchases of  capital equipment purchases consist primarily of manufacturing equipment  office equipment and computer and related equipment used in engineering 
in addition  the company capitalizes certain software development costs 
amounts capitalized were   and  in  and  respectively 
in march  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased a total of  shares at total cost of  the program authorized in is still in effect 
cash provided by financing activities of  and  for and  respectively  was principally the result of the exercise of stock options 
during  cash provided by financing activities was principally the result of the company s initial public offering of its common stock in january impact of the year issue many companies are facing a potential issue regarding the ability of information systems to accommodate the coming year the year issue is the result of computer programs using only the last two digits to indicate the year 
if uncorrected  such computer programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause computer system failure or other computer errors disrupting operations 
the company recognizes the importance of the year issue and has been giving it high priority 
the company created a corporate wide year project team and the team s objective is to ensure an uninterrupted transition into the year the scope of the year readiness effort includes i information technology it such as software and hardware  ii non it systems or embedded technology  and iii readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers 
if needed modifications and conversions are not made on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company has completed phase i of its readiness plan for its it systems and non it systems 
this phase consisted of evaluating its systems and equipment based on the current status and normal scheduled upgrade and replacement of such system components 
the company is in the process of completing phase ii which consists of testing it system and non it system components whose year status cannot be determined by research and has begun certain parts of phase iii  upgrading its it system 
the remaining parts of phase iii are planned during the third quarter  and will consist of upgrading and or replacement of non it system components specifically required for year readiness 
phase iv  planned during the fourth quarter of  will consist of finalizing contingency plans for temporary operation should unexpected difficulties with it systems and non it systems occur 
the development of these contingency plans began in conjunction with upgrading its it system 
in addition to internal year it and non it remediation activities  the company has contacted key suppliers to assure no interruption in the relationship between the company and these important third parties from the year issue 
the company is waiting for responses from these suppliers to assess if such third parties have any known year issues 
if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on company operations 
the company believes that its diligent actions with key suppliers will minimize these risks 
the vast majority of the company s products are not date sensitive 
the company has of summarized information on its products and this information has been available to customers since november while the company expects its internal it and non it systems to be year compliant by the dates specified within its internal plan  the company is working on a contingency plan specifying what the company will do if it or important third parties are not year compliant by the required dates 
the company expects to have such a contingency plan finalized by the second half of through december  the company has not incurred significant incremental costs related to the year issue 
the total projected incremental cost is estimated to be  the company is expensing as incurred all costs related to the assessment and remediation of the year issue unless the nature of the item is an upgrade or replacement of a system with a useful life that meets the capitalization policy of the company 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
the company s total cost for the year issue includes estimated costs and time associated with interfacing with third parties year issues 
these estimates are based on current information 
the company s current estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to remediate and test its computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
the estimates were made using assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  year modification plans  implementation success by key third parties  and other factors 
new developments may occur that could affect the company s estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to modify and test its it and non it systems for year compliance 
these developments include  but are not limited to i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and equipment  and iii the planning and year compliance success that key customers and suppliers attain 
year compliance is an issue for virtually all businesses  whose computer systems and applications may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications 
companies owning and operating such systems may plan to devote a substantial portion of their information systems spending to fund such upgrades and modifications 
it is the company s intention to fulfill its plan and become year compliant  however  uncertainties exist about the thoroughness of how other companies  vendors  customers and other service providers  that the company does business with will be successful at also becoming year compliant 
these other companies  regardless of the dollar volume transacted with the company  may significantly affect either directly or indirectly the operations of the company 
where practicable  the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of suppliers to be year compliant 
in the event that suppliers are not year compliant  the company will seek alternative sources of supplies 
however  such failures remain a possibility and could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk and changes in the market value of its investments  and believes its exposure to such risk is minimal 
the company s investments are made in accordance with the company s investment policy and primarily consists of us treasury securities  municipal securities and corporate obligations 
the company does not participate in the investment of derivative financial instruments
