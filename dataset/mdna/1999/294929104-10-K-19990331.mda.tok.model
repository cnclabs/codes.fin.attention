year computer issue what is year the year yk issue is the result of many computer systems and applications and other electronically controlled systems and equipment using two digit fields rather than four to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  date sensitive systems with this deficiency may recognize the year as year or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year can cause the system to process critical financial information and operations information incorrectly  disrupting the normal business activities of companies 
the company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of the yk issue on its reporting systems and operations 
the company plans to complete the yk project approximately by september  state of readiness 
the systems and applications that can affect the company s operations due to yk issue are its financial reporting systems and the wagering system 
the administrative applications word processing  spreadsheet and software financial applications utilized by the company have been certified by the various publishers to be yk compliant 
the hardware component of the company s financial systems consists of industry standard pc operating systems  servers  desktop computers and networking hardware 
the systems have been evaluated and the company has determined that some of its subsidiaries will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its hardware and software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  third party impact on operations 
the company utilized software and related computer technologies essential to the wagering operations and the page off tack betting system of its race tracks  which is provided by an outside firm 
the company presently relies in the representations made by this firm which believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the yk issue can be mitigated 
the company also utilized certain telecommunication systems for the transmission of data between the race tracks and its off track betting agencies 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own yk issue 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completely timely  the yk issue will have a material impact on the operations and the financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries as the race tracks would not be able to process wagering  resulting in loss of revenues 
costs to achieve yk compliance 
during  costs incurred by the company in mitigating the yk issue have been nominal 
the company has estimated total remaining cost of the yk project in less than  for acquisition of equipment and systems upgrades 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows at each race track  mostly attributable to the acquisition of equipment  which will be capitalized 
the costs of theprojectand the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
risks of yk issue 
the failure of the company s financial systems and accounting operations will affect the company s reporting functions 
however  these functions are not considered detrimental to the company s operations 
the failure of the wagering computer system and software  provided by an outside firm  will not allow the race tracks to process wagering or take bets through its off track betting system  resulting in the lost of revenues 
this risk would seriously affect the financial condition of the company 
contingency plans 
the company is evaluating various alternative scenarios in order to complete a contingent operational work plan to continue business operations beyond said plan will attempt to achieve  mainly  the continuance of the wagering operations of the race tracks 
the contingent plan is expected to be completed by september  forward looking statement certain matters discussed and statements made within this form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of and as such may involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements
