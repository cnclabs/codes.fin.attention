item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table contains income and expenses from the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal   and expressed as a percentage of total revenue 
fiscal year total revenue total cost of sales and revenue gross profit margin selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses  net acquisition related expenses restructuring charge total operating expenses earnings loss from operations total other expense income earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net earnings loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decline is due to the severe downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment industry as a result of over capacity  coupled with a financial crisis in asia that occurred in the first half of fiscal these factors led to a sequential decline in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal  in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal with a strong recovery in our semiconductor equipment business in the second half of fiscal  this segment of our business declined by only to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this strong recovery was due to the strength of our customers business and the success of our new products for this segment 
the medical and industrial segment declined by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to the impact of the financial crisis in asia 
the systems segment of the business increased primarily due to the acquisition of astex plasmaquest 
research contract revenue was flat at approximately of total sales in fiscal and fiscal gross profit gross profit declined by to million or of sales in fiscal compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decline is a result of reduced manufacturing volumes and underutilization of capacity manufacturing in the first half of fiscal  and an inventory write down of million  primarily due to the unexpected severity of the downturn in the semiconductor equipment business 
we continue to seek to develop and introduce products having higher gross profit margins 
in addition  in the first six months of fiscal we consolidated our modesto  california facility into our woburn massachusetts and colorado springs  colorado sites and our beverly  massachusetts facility into woburn in order to reduce our fixed costs and improve gross margins 
gross profit as a percent of sales improved in our fourth quarter of fiscal to compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily as a result of the cost reduction activities  improved utilization of manufacturing capacity  and the success of new product introductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is a result of the establishment of the global customer operations organization and increased staffing to strengthen our global marketing  sales  service and product management infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million compared to million in fiscal due to higher information systems costs from implementation of a new company wide enterprise resource planning erp system  increased goodwill amortization  administrative expenses associated with new acquisitions  and management changes including expanding the senior management team 
as a result of consolidation of two facilities in the first six months of fiscal and the consolidation of the plasmaquest facility in dallas  texas to our woburn  massachusetts facility  announced in the fourth quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge in fiscal the restructuring charge for the consolidation of modesto  california and beverly  massachusetts consisted of severance related to the termination of full time employees  abandonment of leasehold improvements and fixed assets  and facility costs  primarily future lease payments relating to abandoned facilities 
at june  all restructuring costs for these two facilities have been paid out with the exception of approximately  for abandoned facility costs expected to be paid our over the next months 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted the restructuring accrual for the modesto  california and the beverly  massachusetts facilities and took back into income approximately  accrued as an estimate in our first quarter 
the restructuring costs of  for the dallas facility are for the severance of full time employees  abandonment of leasehold and fixed assets  and future lease payments relating to abandoned facilities 
these costs are expected to be paid out over the next months 
in addition to the million restructuring costs  we incurred  of other transition costs in fiscal for moving inventory and equipment and training personnel 
we expect additional transition costs in the first and second quarter of fiscal for the dallas facility of approximately  primarily for the relocation of inventory and equipment and three key employees 
the total fiscal expense relating to restructuring  inventory write down  and transition costs was million 
these consolidations are expected to reduce our fixed and administrative costs by million per year 
research and development expenses net research and development expenses decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as we decreased our overall level of investment in response to the decline in revenues in the first half of fiscal gross spending including funded joint development and the direct costs of research contracts decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal there were no acquisition related charges in fiscal as part of the acquisition of astex sorbios in october  we incurred an acquisition related expense of  for the fair value of acquired in process research and development projects 
operating income we had an operating loss of million in fiscal compared to an operating profit of million in fiscal the operating loss is a result of the revenue declines  restructuring  inventory write downs  and transition costs and increased operating expenses as a percent of income 
other income and income taxes total other income increased by to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal a decline in interest expense and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal is a result of repayment of bank debt and the sale of an investment in another company which resulted in a one time gain of  in fiscal interest income increased in fiscal due to the interest earned on the cash from our secondary stock offering in march we had a tax benefit of  in fiscal compared to a tax expense of  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue total revenue increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this growth was a result of significantly increased revenues from our semiconductor capital equipment customers and from the acquisitions of converter power  inc astex cpi in may and sorbios gmbh astex sorbios in october medical and industrial segment revenues  including revenues from astex cpi  increased by million or for fiscal compared to fiscal with most of the growth due to the revenues from astex cpi 
the systems segment revenues were flat in both years at approximately million  declining from of total revenue in fiscal to in fiscal the astex cpi and astex sorbios acquisitions added incremental total revenue of million and million respectively compared to fiscal  or of total revenue 
without these acquisitions  total revenue increased to million from million  an increase of 
research contract revenue declined by  compared to fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by to million in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit as a percent of total revenue decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of astex cpi whose products have a lower gross margin than other products sold by us 
in addition  gross profit margins were impacted by volume declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in unabsorbed manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses increased by to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percent of revenue to from in fiscal increased selling expenses were primarily a result of the acquisitions of astex cpi and astex sorbios 
general and administrative expenses were flat as a percent of revenue at  although total general and administrative expenses increased by to million compared to fiscal  primarily due to acquisitions 
research and development net research and development expenses decreased as a percent of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal net research and development expenses increased by to million 
gross spending total research and development spending including funded joint development and the direct costs of research contracts increased by to million 
we developed and introduced a number of new technology products including astron for cvd chamber cleaning  liquozon for wafer cleaning  rf for hdp cvd and new laser power supplies for medical applications 
we are committed to continued investments in research and development in order to advance our position as a market and technological leader 
as a part of the acquisition of astex sorbios in fiscal  a valuation process was performed to establish the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as part of this process  we incurred an expense of  for in process research and development 
this compares with acquisition related expenses of  incurred with the acquisition of astex cpi in fiscal operating income operating income increased to million or of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding one time charges for acquisition related expenses in both years  operating income increased by million or 
the increase in operating income is a result of increased sales and lower expenses as a percent of revenue 
other expenses and income taxes interest expense decreased to  in fiscal compared to fiscal  while interest income increased by to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense and the increase in interest income are a result of conversion of warrants issued in connection with our ipo in november see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the sale of an investment in low entropy systems  inc  which resulted in a one time gain of  income tax expense increased to million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal foreign currency fluctuations our foreign revenues are generally denominated in us dollars 
the acquisition of astex sorbios gmbh increased the risk of foreign currency fluctuations  however  significant astex sorbios business is conducted with us companies in dollars which reduces the foreign exchange fluctuation risk 
foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the comparison of the results of operations for the periods presented 
over time  as we expand our operations in europe and the far east  more revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies  increasing the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and short term investments of million with working capital of million at the end of fiscal compared to cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million at the end of fiscal footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of recent acquisitions we have completed 
these include klee corporation in april  plasmaquest  inc in november  sorbios gmbh in october  and cpi in may subsequent to year end  we acquired the assets of the shamrock product line from sputtered films  inc see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  we completed a secondary offering that raised approximately million through the sale of million shares of common stock at per share 
in november  we completed our ipo and received net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of common stock at per share and  five year redeemable warrants at per warrant 
on september   we announced that we had met the requirements for the redemption of our redeemable warrants and called the warrants for redemption 
net proceeds as a result of the conversion of warrants to common stock were million 
the proceeds were used to repay all bank debt  to complete the astex sorbios acquisition  and increase working capital 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  we purchased  of series a convertible preferred stock of low entropy systems  inc les 
in august  we sold all of our shares of les to balzers and leybold us holding  inc for  during fiscal our cash position increased by million 
cash provided from operating activities amounted to million  cash used for investing activities was million  and cash provided from financing activities was million 
cash of million from operations consisted of a net loss of million offset by million of noncash depreciation  amortization and loss on disposal of assets of  cash used for investing activities was primarily for additions to property  plant and equipment  and patents 
cash provided by financing activities was primarily from the issuance of common stock offset by repayment of notes payable for  and advances to subsidiaries prior to acquisition of million 
we raised million from issuance of common stock  primarily from a subsequent stock offering completed in march that raised approximately million 
during fiscal  we generated million in net cash flows from operating activities and used million for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of million for the acquisition of sorbios gmbh  million for additions to property  equipment  and patents  offset by sales of million in investments primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills and sale of  for our investment in les 
cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of repayment of bank debt for million and proceeds from issuance of common stock for million which was primarily from the redemption of warrants and exercise of stock options by employees 
during fiscal  we generated million in net cash flows from operating activities and used a net million for investing activities 
cash used for investing activities consisted of million for the acquisition of astex cpi  million for additions to property  equipment  and patents  and million for the purchase of investments  offset by sales of million in investments 
investments are primarily commercial paper and government treasury bills 
cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of notes payable of million offset by note repayments of million and proceeds of  from issuance of common stock which was primarily due to exercise of employee stock options 
the proceeds of notes payable were a result of additional borrowings for the acquisition of astex cpi  while the repayments were primarily a result of debt restructuring for the acquisition 
we have a credit facility with state street bank which consists of an million unsecured demand line of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate of at june  this facility is subject to certain financial covenants which are tested quarterly 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants 
at june   we had no borrowings against the line of credit 
this line of credit expires in may we continue to use cash resources for developing new products  expanding sales and marketing  performing collaborative product development projects  and for general working capital 
we seek joint ventures and or acquisitions that will enhance our position in our markets with the potential to increase revenue and profitability 
we believe that existing cash resources  anticipated cash flows from operations and our credit facility will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses and working capital requirements for a period of at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  we will be required to adopt several new accounting pronouncements 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results from time to time  information we provide or statements made by our employees may contain forward looking information which involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated operating expense levels  gross margin estimates and the availability of funds to meet cash requirements may be forward looking statements 
our actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below and the accuracy of our internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
customer concentration relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales to our ten largest customers in fiscal years   and accounted for   and of revenues  respectively 
in fiscal years   and  sales to applied materials  our largest customer in each of these periods  accounted for approximately   and of our revenues  respectively 
we expect that sales to applied materials will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future  although the acquisitions of astex plasmaquest  astex sorbios  astex cpi and the shamrock product line acquired in the first quarter of fiscal are expected to provide a reduction in our reliance on applied materials 
see subsequent events footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the shamrock product line acquisition 
although a number of our customers do enter into long term supply agreements  these agreements typically allow the customer to cancel orders with limited penalties 
a reduction or delay in orders from applied materials or other significant customers  including reductions or delays due to market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
dependence on cyclical industries our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demands for capital equipment  including the products we manufacture and market 
our future financial condition  revenues and operating results may be materially adversely affected by semiconductor industry downturns or slowdowns 
during fiscal  the semiconductor industry had excess capacity for most types of devices  which caused semiconductor manufacturers to significantly decrease their levels of capital spending 
in the personal computer market  a shift in demand from more expensive  high performance computers to lower priced models resulted in reduced profitability for semiconductor manufacturers  resulting in delays and further decreases in capital spending 
our results for the first half of fiscal were adversely affected by the semiconductor capital equipment downturn as a result of these factors 
we restructured our operations  reducing use of temporary employees  reducing staff and consolidating several facilities to reduce our fixed costs and incurred consolidation costs as discussed above under the gross profit comparison of fiscal to renewed over capacity in the semiconductor could cause weakness in demand for our products 
reliance on oem customers  lengthy sales cycle our products are primarily sold to oems which incorporate our products into their equipment 
due to the significant capital commitments usually incurred by semiconductor manufacturers in their purchase of the oem s equipment  these manufacturers demand highly reliable products which require as long as several years for oems to develop 
our revenues are therefore primarily dependent upon the timing and effectiveness of the efforts of our oem customers in developing and marketing equipment incorporating our products 
there can be no assurance that any equipment incorporating our products will be marketed successfully by our customers 
asian economies asian countries have had economic difficulties that caused economic slowdowns or recessions in those countries 
asia has historically been an important region for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
if these economies do not continue to recover in the near future  the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment industry may be interrupted in time or reduced in scale 
the economic difficulties of these countries could also have a negative impact on the economies of the us and europe  leading to declines in demand for our products 
japanese market the japanese semiconductor equipment markets are large and difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
we believe that increasing our penetration of the japanese market is important to our business  and that we are currently at a competitive disadvantage to japanese suppliers  many of which have long standing collaborative relationships with japanese semiconductor process equipment manufactures 
moreover  our ability to compete effectively in the japanese markets may be limited by our size and our geographic location 
although we intend to expand our direct presence in japan  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve significant sales to  or compete successfully in  japan 
foreign revenues we do business worldwide  both directly and via sales to united states based oems who sell such products internationally 
in fiscal years   and  foreign revenues accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenues 
we anticipate that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenues  which will result in a significant portion of our revenues and operating results being subject to risks associated with foreign revenues  including united states and foreign regulatory and policy changes  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing representatives  and foreign currency fluctuations 
highly competitive industries the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
a number of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in selling our products to oems or end users  regardless of the performance or the price of our products 
competitors may develop superior products or products of similar quality at the same or lower prices 
other technical innovations may impair our ability to market our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully 
new products and technological change the semiconductor manufacturing industry has been characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards 
we believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future 
our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop new products to meet customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in introducing products or product enhancements on a timely basis  if at all  or that we will be able to market successfully these products and product enhancements once developed 
further  there can be no assurance that our products will not be rendered obsolete by new industry standards or changing technology 
management of growth and consolidation we have recently gone though a period of rapid growth subsequent to a period of consolidation 
due to the level of technical and marketing expertise necessary to support our existing and new customers  we must attract and retain highly qualified and well trained personnel 
there can be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire and retain such personnel 
our expansion and contraction may also significantly strain our management  manufacturing  financial and other resources 
there can be no assurance that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support our operations 
failure to manage our growth properly could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
quarterly fluctuations in operating results and market price of securities our quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as economic conditions in the semiconductor industry  the timing of significant orders and shipments of our products  changes and delays in product development  new product introductions by us and our competitors  the mix of products sold by us and competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  a number of our products have high selling prices 
as a result  quarterly variations in systems sales could significantly affect our operating results 
moreover  customers may cancel or reschedule shipments and production difficulties could delay shipments 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  revenues and operating results 
the marketing price of our securities could also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the semiconductor industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to us 
effects of inflation we believe that  over the past three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenues or operating results 
year disclosure many currently installed computer systems and software products are dependent upon internal calendars coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with year requirements 
we believe that our financial reporting and enterprise resource planning erp systems were year compliant as of june except for the recently acquired astex plasmaquest operation which is not currently a material component of our business 
we are currently in the process of updating our financial reporting and erp systems with sap r  which has been represented as being year compliant by its producer 
we are currently using sap r in our facility in woburn  ma 
the current erp software packages used by astex eto  are represented as being year compliant 
the software package used by astex sorbios was not year compliant  however  we purchased an upgrade that is represented as being year compliant and implemented this software in april we plan to upgrade the astex plasmaquest system to be year compliant before october our other software is generally certified by the vendor as year compliant or is not considered critical to our operations 
we have spent approximately million through june on sap r software  hardware and consultants 
we plan future sap r implementation expenditures of approximately  although we believe future sap r implementation cost estimates to be accurate  we can not provide any assurance that these costs will not increase or that the implementations will occur by the dates estimated 
we have conducted a review of our manufacturing equipment and facilities to ensure year compliance 
based on our assessment  we do not anticipate that a material year issue will be discovered in this area 
we have addressed the year preparedness of our critical suppliers and our major customers and related electronic data interfaces with these third parties 
we have contacted critical suppliers and major customers to determine whether they are  or will be  compliant by the year based upon this evaluation  we will seek new vendors where necessary and have formulated contingency plans to resolve customer related issues that may arise 
at this time we cannot estimate the impact that noncompliant suppliers and customers may have on us or our level of operations in the year we have completed a systematic review of our products in operation at customer locations and have identified noncompliant products and offered all necessary modifications to make them compliant 
however  as many of our products are complex  interact with third party products  and operate on computer systems that are not under our control  there can be no assurance that we have identified all of the year problems associated with our products 
there is expected to be a significant amount of litigation relating to the year issue and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs in defending or bringing lawsuits 
in addition  if any year issues are identified  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain qualified personnel to remedy such issues 
any unexpected costs or delays arising from the year issue could have a significant adverse impact on our business  operations  and financial condition in amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of short term investments and financial instruments caused by fluctuations in investment prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address market risks in accordance with established policies 
our risk managment activities involve risk and uncertainties and accordingly  results could differ materially from those projected 
interest rate risk due to the fact that long term notes receivable mature within years  management has determined that the fair value does not differ materially from the carrying amount 
foreign exchange risk we do not obtain a significant amount of sales denominated in other than us currency 
investment risk our investment securities are united states instruments with original maturities of ninety days or less and are considered cash equivalents
