item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial review and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations  for the years ended june   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other detailed information appearing in this document 
securitizations the ongoing securitization of loans and leases is a central part of our current business strategy 
we sell loans and leases through securitizations with servicing retained in order to fund growing loan and lease originations and to provide additional sources of revenue through retained mortgage and lease servicing rights 
in fiscal  we completed securitizations aggregating million  consisting of million in business purpose loans  million in home equity loans and million in equipment leases 
such securitizations generated gains on the sale of loans and leases of million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal years ended june   and gain on sale of loans and leases resulting from securitizations as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
we rely primarily on securitizations to generate cash proceeds for repayment of warehouse credit facilities and other borrowings and to originate additional loans and leases 
several factors affect our ability to complete securitizations  including conditions in the securities markets generally  conditions in the asset backed securities markets specifically and credit quality of the portfolio of loans and leases serviced 
any substantial reduction in the size or availability of the securitization market for loans and leases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our quarterly revenues and net income have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future principally as a result of the timing and size of securitizations and changes in market interest rates 
the strategy of selling loans and leases through securitizations require building an inventory of loans and leases over time  during which time costs and expenses are incurred 
since a gain on sale is not recognized until a securitization is completed  which may not occur until a subsequent quarter  operating results for a given quarter can fluctuate significantly as a result of the timing and level of securitizations 
if securitizations do not close when expected  we could experience a materially adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter 
the gain on sale of loans and leases may be unfavorably impacted to the extent we hold fixed rate mortgage loans or leases in our available for sale portfolio prior to securitization 
a significant variable affecting the gain on sale of loans and leases in a securitization is the spread between the average coupon rate on fixed rate loans and leases  and the weighted average pass through rate to investors for interests issued in connection with a securitization 
although the loan and lease coupon rate is fixed at the time the loan or lease is originated  the pass through rate to investors is not fixed until the pricing of the securitization which occurs just prior the sale of the loans and leases 
therefore  if market rates required by investors increase prior to securitization of the loans and leases  the spread between the average coupon rate on the loans and leases and the pass through rate to investors may be reduced or eliminated 
in addition  due to the timing difference between the period when costs are incurred in connection with the origination of loans and leases and their subsequent sale through the securitization process  we may operate on a negative cash flow basis  which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we also rely upon funds generated by the sale of subordinated debt and other borrowings to fund our operations 
at june   million of subordinated debt was outstanding and credit facilities and lines of credit totaling million were available  of which million was drawn upon on such date 
in addition  we had a million commercial paper conduit to finance equipment lease origination of which million was utilized at june  we expect to continue to rely on such borrowings to fund loans and leases prior to securitization 
certain accounting considerations as a fundamental part of our business and financing strategy  we securitize the majority of our loans and leases by selling them to trusts for cash and a retained interest in the securitized loans and leases which is called a residual interest 
the trust issues multi class securities which derive their cash flows from a pool of securitized loans and leases 
these securities which represent the remaining interest in the trust called the regular interests  are sold to public investors 
we also retain servicing on securitized loans and leases 
as the holder of the residual interests in a securitization  we are entitled to receive certain excess or residual cash flows 
these cash flows are the difference between the payments made by the borrowers and the sum of the scheduled and prepaid principal and interest paid to the investors in the trust  servicing fees  trustee fees and  if applicable  insurance fees 
overcollateralization requirements  representing an excess of the aggregate principal balances of loans and leases in a securitized pool over investor interests  are established to provide credit enhancement for the trust investors 
in order to meet the required overcollateralization levels the trust initially retains the excess cash flow until after the overcollateralization requirements  which are specific to each securitization  are met 
gain on sale of loans and leases through securitizations represent the difference between our net proceeds and the allocated cost of loans and leases securitized 
the allocated cost of the loans and leases securitized is determined by allocating their net carrying value between the loans and leases securitized  the residual interests and the mortgage servicing rights retained  based upon their relative fair values 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise  which was effective for fiscal quarters beginning after december   we classified our residual interests as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with subsequent adjustments to fair value recorded in stockholders equity and reported as a component of comprehensive income 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the differences between the fair value of residual interests and their allocated costs was recorded as gain on securitization and included in gain on sale of loans and leases 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial condition  but reduced the recorded gain on sale by approximately million pre tax in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the calculation of the fair value of the residual interest is based upon the present value of the future expected excess cash flows and utilizes certain assumptions made by management at the time loans and leases are sold 
these assumptions include the discount rate used to calculate present value  the rates of prepayment and default rates on the pool of loans 
the rate of prepayment of loans may be affected by a variety of economic and other factors  including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing to borrowers 
the effect of those factors on loan and lease prepayment rates may vary depending on the type of loan or lease 
estimates of prepayment rates are made based on management s expectation of future prepayment rates  which are based  in part  on the historical rate of repayment of the loans and leases and other considerations 
although we believe we have made reasonable estimates of prepayment rates and default assumptions  the actual prepayment and default experience may materially vary from our estimates 
the gain recognized upon the sale of loans and leases will have been overstated if prepayments or losses are greater than estimated 
additionally  certain of our securitization trusts have issued floating rate certificates supported by fixed rate mortgages 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive would be affected by any changes in the rates paid on the floating rate certificates 
to the extent that prepayments or delinquencies differ from the estimates made  adjustments of the gain on sale of loans and leases may be required 
higher levels of future prepayments  delinquencies and or liquidations could result in a reduction in the value of residual interests which would adversely affect income in the period of adjustment 
we also sell loans with servicing released referred to as whole loan sales 
gains on whole loan sales equal the difference between the net proceeds from such sales and the loans net carrying value 
the net carrying value of loans is equal to their principal balance plus unamortized origination costs and fees 
gains from these sales are recorded as fee income 
the timing of sales of loans and leases and the amount of loans and leases sold will impact earnings from quarter to quarter 
subsequent to the initial recognition of the residual interests in a securitization  ongoing assessments are made to determine the fair value of the expected future excess cash flows based upon current market conditions 
at june   investments in residual interests in securitizations totaled million including investments in interest only strips of million and investments in overcollateralization of million 
when loans or leases are sold through a securitization  the servicing on the loans or leases is retained and the fair value of contractual servicing fees net of the allocated costs of servicing is recognized as a separate asset for accounting purposes 
fair value of servicing rights is determined by computing the present value of projected net cash flows expected to be received over the life of the loans or leases securitized 
such projections incorporate assumptions  including servicing costs  prepayment rates  default rates and discount rates 
these assumptions are similar to those used to value the residual interests retained in a securitization 
periodically  capitalized servicing rights are evaluated for impairment  which is measured as the excess of unamortized cost over fair value 
we have generally found that non conforming borrowers are less sensitive to interest rates than monthly payment balances 
therefore  interest rates are not considered as a predominant risk characteristic for purposes of evaluating impairment 
at june   servicing rights totaled million  compared to million at june  results of operations summary financial results in thousands  except per share data percentage year ended june  change total revenues    total expenses    net income    return on average equity return on average assets earnings per share basic diluted dividends declared per share overview for fiscal  net income increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal basic earnings per common share increased to on average common shares of  compared to per share on average common shares of  for fiscal diluted earnings per common share increased to on average common shares of  compared to per share on average common shares of  for fiscal all average common share and earnings per common share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of a stock dividend declared august  see note in the consolidated financial statements for further description 
the increases in net income and earnings per share primarily resulted from the impact of increases in the volume of loans and leases securitized during the periods and increases in the collection of fee income due to the increase in loans and leases available for sale and securitized loans and leases for which servicing was retained  referred to as the total managed portfolio 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we increased our quarterly dividend by to per share 
dividends of were paid in fiscal compared to dividends of in fiscal the common dividend payout ratio based on diluted earnings per share was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to increase loan and lease origination volume through both geographic expansion and growth in current markets 
the implementation of this strategy will depend in large part on a variety of factors outside of our control  including  but not limited to  the ability to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms and profitably securitize loans and leases on a regular basis and continue to expand in the face of increasing competition 
our failure with respect to any of these factors could impair our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in gains on sale of loans and leases through securitizations and servicing income 
gain on sale of loans and leases 
gain on sale of loans and leases increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was the result of selling million of loans and leases through securitizations in fiscal  including million of business purpose loans  million of home equity loans and million of equipment leases  compared to million of business purpose loans  million of home equity loans and million of equipment leases in fiscal gain on sale of loans and leases as a percentage of loans and leases securitized was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal factors impacting the year to year comparability of the gain percentage included the adoption of sfas no 
on january  which reduced pre tax gains by approximately  a decline in the average coupon on loans and leases originated during fiscal  and an increase in the rate required to be paid to investors in fiscal securitizations 
gain on sale of loans and leases securitized represents the difference between the net proceeds received  and the allocated cost of loans and leases securitized 
the allocated cost of the loans and leases securitized is determined by allocating their net carrying value between the loans and leases securitized  the retained residual interests in the securitization and the mortgage servicing rights retained  based upon their relative fair values 
the calculation of the fair value of the residual interest is based upon the present value of the future expected excess cash flows and utilizes certain assumptions made by management at the time loans and leases are sold 
assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of residual interests include the discount rate used to calculate present value and the rates of prepayment and default on the pool of loans 
see interest only strips and servicing assets for more information regarding these assumptions 
the following schedule details loan and lease originations during the fiscal years ended june   and in thousands year ended june  business purpose loans    home equity loans    equipment leases    interest and fee income 
interest and fee income was million for the year ended june   substantially unchanged from the year ended june  interest and fee income consists primarily of income earned on loans and leases while held in our portfolio  premiums earned on whole loan sales and other ancillary fees collected in connection with loan and lease originations 
interest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the duration of time portfolio loans accrued interest income prior to securitization and a reduction in the average coupon earned on loans and leases originated  from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline in the average coupon in fiscal primarily resulted from competitive pricing in the home equity lending market 
fee income increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase in fee income was due to an increase in ancillary fees earned in connection with increased originations and an increase in fees earned on whole loan sales 
during the year ended june   we completed approximately million of whole loan sales as compared to million during the year ended june  servicing income 
servicing income is comprised of contractual and ancillary fees collected on securitized loans and leases  less amortization of the servicing assets recorded at the time the loans and leases are securitized 
servicing income increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this increase resulted from the higher average total managed portfolio  which was million during the year ended june  compared to million during the year ended june  as a percentage of the average managed portfolio  servicing income increased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june   as a result in the origination of loans with prepayment fees and the collection of other ancillary fees 
total expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  as described in more detail below  this increase was primarily a result of higher interest expense attributable to sales of subordinated debt securities and borrowings used to fund loan and lease originations and increases in sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
these increases related to the growth in loan and lease originations  the growth in the total managed portfolio and the continued building of support area infrastructure to support the increases in originated and managed portfolios 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to an increase in the amount of subordinated debt outstanding during fiscal  the proceeds of which were used to fund loan and lease originations and investments in operations required to position us for future growth  and the costs related to greater utilization of warehouse and credit line facilities to fund loan and lease originations 
average subordinated debt outstanding during the year ended june  was million compared to million during the year ended june  average interest rates paid on outstanding subordinated debt increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  due to increases in the rates offered on subordinated debt in order to respond to general increases in market rates and to attract additional funds 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse and other credit lines were million during the year ended june   compared to million during the year ended june  provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses on portfolio loans and leases for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal an allowance for credit losses for portfolio loans and leases and other receivables is maintained primarily to account for loans and leases that are delinquent and are expected to be ineligible for sale into a future securitization 
the allowance is calculated based upon management s estimate of the expected collectibility of loans and leases outstanding based upon a variety of factors  including but not limited to  periodic analysis of the portfolio  economic conditions and trends  historical credit loss experience  borrowers ability to repay  and collateral considerations 
although we maintain an allowance for credit losses at the level we consider adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that an additional provision will not be required 
the allowance for credit losses was million at june  as compared to million at june  in addition to the allowance for credit losses on portfolio loans and leases  certain assumptions are made regarding the expected impact of credit losses on the fair value of interest only strips and residual interests created in securitizations 
see interest only strips and servicing assets for more information regarding these credit loss assumptions

 balance at end of period the increase in net charge offs in fiscal primarily relates to the maturing of the total managed portfolio 
charge offs related to loan and lease securitizations generally have been recorded in abfs s books if an impaired loan is repurchased from the securitization 
employee related costs 
employee related costs increased million  or to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of additions to staff in support of the increased marketing efforts  loan and lease originations and servicing activities 
management anticipates that these expenses will continue to increase in the future as our expansion continues and loan and lease originations continue to increase 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year end june  the increases were primarily attributable to targeted television and radio advertising related to home equity loans and advertising costs resulting from increased newspaper and direct mail advertising related to sales of subordinated debt and loan products 
during fiscal  targeted television advertising was intensified in chicago  florida and georgia 
subject to market conditions  we plan to continue to expand our service area throughout the united states 
as a result  it is anticipated that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rent  telephone  office expenses  professional fees and other expenses incurred as a result of previously discussed increases in loan and lease originations and in the volume of total loans and leases managed during fiscal and the continued building of support area infrastructure to support the increases in originations and the managed portfolio 
income taxes

total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was related to the increase in loan and lease originations  costs associated with a larger managed portfolio of loans and leases  geographic expansion of our market and the october  acquisition and operation of new jersey mortgage and investment corp 
and subsidiaries 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase was attributable to increases in the amount of subordinated debt outstanding  greater utilization of warehouse lines of credit to fund loans and leases and debt assumed and incurred in connection with the acquisition of new jersey mortgage

cash and cash equivalents increased million  or to at june  from million at june  primarily due to receipts from sales of subordinated debt securities 
interest only strips and other receivables comprised mainly of interest only and residual strips created in connection with securitizations increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  during fiscal million in loan and lease securitizations were completed resulting in the recognition of million of interest only strips 
at june   other receivables included million due on sold loans compared to million at june  servicing rights increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to the recording of million of servicing rights obtained in connection with loan and lease securitizations  partially offset by amortization of servicing rights 
loan and lease receivables available for sale decreased million  or  at june   primarily due to the timing and size of fourth quarter fiscal securitizations 
mortgage loans securitized in the fourth quarter of fiscal were million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal total liabilities increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to increases in subordinated debt and notes payable 
the increase in subordinated debt and notes payable of million  or  was primarily attributable to million of net sales of subordinated debt securities

see liquidity and capital resources for further detail 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due to growth in lending and leasing activities resulting in larger accruals for interest expense and other operating expenses 
deferred income taxes increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due to timing differences in recognition of income from securitizations 
june  compared to june  total assets increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to increases in loans and leases available for sale  other receivables and other assets 
loans and leases available for sale increased million  or  to million at june   from million at june  the increase was the result of increases in originations  net of sales  of million during year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  interest only strips and other receivables increased million  or  to million at june   from million at june  and servicing rights increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june   both due to loan and lease securitizations during fiscal other assets increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due to the recognition of million of goodwill  net of amortization  resulting from the acquisition of new jersey mortgage 
total liabilities increased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  due primarily to a net increase in subordinated debt and notes payable and to a lesser extent increases in other liabilities 
the increase in subordinated debt and notes payable of million was due to net sales of subordinated debt of million during the year ended june   an increase in warehouse lines of credit of million due to growth in lending and leasing activities  and a net increase of million of debt assumed and incurred in the acquisition of new jersey mortgage 
at june   million of subordinated debt was outstanding

cash for keys is a program whereby in certain select situations  when collateral values of loans support the action  a delinquent borrower may be offered a monetary payment in exchange for the deed to a property held as collateral for the loan 
this process eliminates the need to initiate a formal foreclosure process which could take many months

profitability and financial performance is sensitive to changes in us treasury yields  libor yields and the spread between the effective rate of interest received on loans and leases available for sale or securitized generally fixed interest rates and the interest rates paid pursuant to credit facilities or the pass through rate to investors for interests issued in connection with securitizations 
also  a substantial and sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our ability to originate and purchase loans and leases 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management strategy is to mitigate the effects of changing interest rates on profitability and the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets primarily interest only strips  servicing rights and loans and leases available for sale 
interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for interest only strips and servicing rights  the table presents projected principal cash flows utilizing certain assumptions including prepayment and default rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in thousands amount maturing in years ending june  there fair after total value rate sensitive assets loans and leases available for sale a     interest only strips         servicing rights         investments held to maturity  rate sensitive liabilities fixed interest rate borrowings         average interest rate variable interest rate borrowings    average interest rate a loans and leases available for sale are generally held for less than three months prior to securitization therefore all loans and leases which qualify for securitization are reflected as maturing in the year ended june  loans and leases available for sale gain on sale of loans and leases may be unfavorably impacted to the extent fixed rate mortgage loans or leases in the available for sale portfolio are held prior to securitization 
a significant variable affecting the gain on sale of loans and leases in a securitization is the spread between the average coupon rate on fixed rate loans and leases  and the weighted average pass through rate to investors for interests issued in connection with the securitization 
although the average loan and lease coupon rate is fixed at the time the loan or lease is originated  the pass through rate to investors is not fixed until the pricing of the securitization which occurs just prior the sale of the loans and leases 
in addition  a portion of the certificates are based on a floating interest rate 
therefore  if market rates required by investors increase prior to securitization of the loans and leases  the spread between the average coupon rate on the loans and leases and the pass through rate to investors may be reduced or eliminated 
hedging strategies are utilized in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates on fixed rate loan and lease portfolios between the date of origination and the date of securitization 
these strategies include the utilization of derivative financial instruments such as futures and forward pricing on securitizations 
the nature and quality of hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage loan and lease originations and purchases 
the gain or loss derived from these hedging transactions is deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the gain on sale of loans and leases when the loans and leases are securitized 
during fiscal  net losses of approximately million were incurred on hedging transactions futures contracts  which were recognized as an offset to the gains on sale recorded on securitizations during the year 
at june  no such contracts were outstanding 
at june   we were obligated to satisfy a lease securitization prefund requirement of million of business equipment leases 
in the future we may expand the types of derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk 
such instruments could include interest rate swaps and interest rate options or other derivative instruments 
we have implemented a hedging strategy in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in market value of fixed rate mortgage loans held for sale 
however  an effective interest rate risk management strategy is complex and no such strategy can completely insulate us from interest rate changes 
the nature and timing of hedging transactions may impact the effectiveness of hedging strategies 
poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than mitigate risk 
in addition  hedging involves transaction and other costs 
such costs could increase as the period covered by the hedging protection increases 
it is expected that such loss would be offset by income realized from the securitizations in that period or in future periods 
as a result  we may be prevented from effectively hedging fixed rate loans held for sale  without reducing income in current or future periods due to the costs associated with hedging activities 
see risk factors our failure to implement an effective hedging strategy could result in losses or negatively impact earnings 
interest only strips and servicing assets a significant decline in market interest rates could increase the level of loan prepayments  thereby decreasing the size of the total managed loan and lease portfolio and the related projected cash flows 
higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments could require a write down of the fair value of related interest only strips and servicing rights  adversely impacting earnings during the period of adjustment

it is estimated that a basis point increase in prepayment rates would decrease the fair value of interest only strips by approximately million and the fair value of servicing assets by approximately million 
we attempt to minimize prepayment risk on interest only strips and servicing assets by requiring prepayment fees on business purpose loans and home equity loans  where permitted by law 
currently  approximately of business purpose loans and of home equity loans in the managed portfolio are subject to prepayment fees 
in addition  we have found that credit impaired borrowers are less sensitive to interest rates than monthly payment balances further reducing prepayment expectations 
subordinated debt we also experience interest rate risk to the extent that as of june  approximately million of our liabilities were comprised of subordinated debt with scheduled maturities of greater than one year 
to the extent that market interest rates demanded for subordinated debt increase in the future  the rates paid on replacement debt could exceed rates currently paid thereby increasing interest expense and reducing net income 
liquidity and capital resources our business requires continual access to short and long term sources of debt financing 
our cash requirements include the funding of loan and lease originations  payment of interest expense  funding of overcollaterization requirements in connection with securitizations  payment of operating expenses and funding of capital expenditures 
we continue to significantly rely on access to the asset backed securities market through securitizations to generate cash proceeds for the repayment of debt and to fund ongoing operations 
as a result of the terms of the securitizations  we will receive less cash flow from the portfolios of loans and leases securitized than we would otherwise receive absent securitizations 
additionally  pursuant to the terms of the securitizations  we will act as the servicer of the loans and leases and in that capacity will be obligated to advance funds in certain circumstances which may create greater demands on our cash flow than either selling loans with servicing released or maintaining a portfolio of loans and leases 
a significant portion of loan originations are non conforming mortgages to subprime borrowers 
certain participants in the non conforming mortgage industry have experienced greater than anticipated losses on their securitization residual interests due to the effects of increased credit losses and increased prepayment rates  resulting in some competitors exiting the business or recording valuation allowances or write downs for these conditions in fiscal in addition  unusual movements in the capital markets in fiscal resulted in increased demand for us treasury securities which had an adverse impact on the demand for asset backed securities including those backed by non conforming mortgage loans 
as a result  some participants experienced restricted access to capital required to fund loan originations  and have been precluded from participation in the asset backed securitization market 
however  we have maintained our ability to obtain funding and to securitize loans and leases 
factors that have minimized the effect of adverse market conditions on abfs include our ability to originate loans and leases through established retail channels  focus on credit underwriting  assessment of prepayment fees on loans  diversification of lending in the home equity  business loan and equipment lease markets and the ability to raise capital through sales of subordinated debt securities pursuant to a registered public offering 
subject to economic  market and interest rate conditions  we intend to continue to implement additional securitizations of our loan and lease portfolios 
any delay or impairment in our ability to securitize loans and leases  as a result of market conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect the results of operations 
to a limited extent  we intend to continue to augment the interest and fee income earned on loan and lease portfolios by selling loans and leases either at the time of origination or from our portfolio to unrelated third parties 
these transactions also create additional liquid funds available for lending activities 
we also rely on borrowings such as subordinated debt and warehouse credit facilities to fund operations 
at june   a total of million of subordinated debt was outstanding  and credit facilities totaling million were available  of which million was drawn upon at such date 
during fiscal  we sold million in principal amount of subordinated debt securities with maturities ranging between one day and ten years 
as of june   approximately million of subordinated debt was outstanding 
under a shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october   we registered million of subordinated debt of which million was available for issuance at june  the proceeds from sales of subordinated debt securities will be used to fund general operating and lending activities 
we intend to meet our obligation to repay such debt as it matures with income from operations  including securitization or sale of loans or leases  working capital and cash generated from additional debt financing 
the utilization of funds for the repayment of such obligations should not adversely affect operations 
the following is a description of the warehouse and line of credit facilities that are utilized to fund origination of loans and leases prior to securitization 
all of these facilities are senior in right of payment to the subordinated debt 
our subsidiaries had an aggregate million interim warehouse and security agreements with prudential securities credit corporation expiring august  to fund loan originations 
the agreement was subsequently increased to million and extended to august  the obligations under these agreements are guaranteed by abfs 
under these agreements  the subsidiaries may obtain advances subject to certain conditions  which extensions of credit bear interest at a specified margin over the libor rate 
the obligations under these agreements are collateralized by pledged loans 
at june   million of this facility was drawn upon 
we along with certain of our subsidiaries  obtained a million warehouse credit facility from a syndicate of banks led by chase bank of texas na expiring october  under this warehouse facility  advances may be obtained  subject to certain conditions  including sublimits based upon the type of collateral securing the advance 
interest rates on the advances are based upon day libor plus a margin 
obligations under the facility are collateralized by certain pledged loans and other collateral related thereto 
the facility also requires the obligation to meet certain financial ratios and contains restrictive covenants  including covenants limiting loans to and transaction with affiliates  the issuance of additional debt  and the types of investments that can be purchased 
at june   million of this facility was drawn upon 
in september our subsidiaries  american business leasing  inc and federal leasing corp  entered into a credit agreement with first union national bank pursuant to which first union committed to extend million of credit in the form of a warehouse line of credit to such entities to enable them to fund eligible lease receivables 
the agreement terminates in september under the first union line of credit  american business leasing and federal leasing may obtain advances in increments of  or greater  subject to certain conditions  which extensions of credit shall bear interest at either the libor rate plus a margin or the prime rate set by first union less a margin at the borrower s option 
this agreement has a term of two years unless accelerated upon an event of default as described in the agreement 
the obligation under the first union line of credit is collateralized by pledged leases and other collateral related thereto 
this obligation is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
at june   million of this line of credit was being utilized 
in october  american business leasing and american business lease funding corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of american business leasing  entered into a million commercial paper conduit underwritten by first union capital markets to finance equipment lease production 
the agreement allows for up to two sales of equipment leases per month into the conduit 
the agreement terminates on october  unless terminated earlier in the event of default described therein 
the cost of financing is the average interest rate on commercial paper plus a margin 
at june   million of this facility was being utilized 
if we do not extend the term of this agreement  we will utilize other lines of credit currently available to us to fund lease production or may explore other financing arrangements 
in december  we and our subsidiaries  american business credit  home american credit and new jersey mortgage entered into an agreement with chase bank pursuant to which chase bank committed to extend million of credit in the form of a security agreement against the class r certificate of the abfs mortgage loan trust under the chase bank line of credit american business credit  home american credit and new jersey mortgage may borrow up to million  subject to certain conditions  which extensions of credit shall bear interest at the libor rate plus a margin 
such agreement has a term of one year unless accelerated upon an event of default as described in such agreement 
at june   million of this line of credit was being utilized 
as of june   million of debt was scheduled to mature during the twelve months ending june  which was mainly comprised of maturing subordinated debt  warehouse lines of credit and other debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of new jersey mortgage 
we currently expect to refinance the maturing debt through extensions of maturing debt or new debt financing and  if necessary  may retire the debt through cash flow from operations and loan sales or securitizations 
despite the current use of securitizations to fund loan growth  we are also dependent upon other borrowings to fund a portion of our operations 
we intend to continue to utilize debt financing to fund operations in the future 
any failure to renew or obtain adequate funding under a warehouse credit facility  or other borrowings  or any substantial reduction in the size or pricing in the markets for loans and leases  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financing  we may have to curtail loan and lease production activities or sell loans and leases rather than securitize them  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we lease our corporate headquarters facilities under a five year operating lease expiring in january at a minimum annual rental of approximately million 
the lease contains a renewal option for an additional period at increased annual rental 
we also leases a facility in roseland  new jersey which functions as the loan production headquarters for new jersey mortgage and its subsidiaries at an annual rental cost of approximately million 
the current lease term expires on july  and contains a renewal option for an additional term of five years at an increased annual rental 
in addition  branch offices are leased on a short term basis in various cities throughout the united states 
the leases for the branch offices are not material to operations

year update a year yk task force was established to assess yk issues and to implement a yk compliance program 
the task force  which meets weekly  includes members of the information technology department  finance department  legal department  representatives from all business units  and an independent consultant with yk expertise 
the task force reports monthly to executive management 
the task force has completed an assessment of the core information technology it systems and is continuing the process of evaluating the remainder of the non core it systems as well as non it systems 
the non it systems include the telecommunications systems  business machines and building and premises systems 
the task force has adopted a five phase approach to assess yk issues and to address those issues that are reasonably within its control phase awareness one of the first tasks performed by the task force was to generate greater awareness of yk issues 
the awareness process included contacting all business units to educate management regarding the yk program and to discern any potential issues 
each business unit has assigned a point of contact to assist the task force in the assessment and compliance process 
awareness efforts will continue throughout the span of the project 
phase assessment an inventory has been conducted of all it hardware and software  including business applications  operating systems  third party products  and internal and external interfaces that may be at risk 
each critical system was reviewed  rated for importance to business operations and identified as retain or retire 
this process has been completed for all core and non core it systems 
we are in the process of replacing most core it systems due to strategic and growth reasons unrelated to the yk issue 
the process began in and completion is anticipated by september  all systems acquired as part of this enhancement project must be certified by their vendors as yk compliant 
non it systems have been evaluated  which include the telecommunications systems  business machines  building and premises systems and key suppliers  whose yk failures could have a material impact on our operation 
this part of the assessment  which was dependent on obtaining specific responses from third parties  was completed as of june  the assessment phase also includes the development of appropriate response plans  which may include repair  conversion  replacement or elimination of affected systems 
phase renovation this phase involves the remediation of yk issues identified as a result of the assessment 
with the exception of a single  vendor provided application  all core it system remediation efforts were completed on schedule june  
the vendor of the non compliant application has committed to remediate and successfully test the system  achieving yk compliance by september  see phase validation 
phase validation this phase involves establishing a test environment  performing systems tests and validating the results 
the systems to be used for testing have been acquired  and the validation process has begun 
yk testing and verification of all new replacement systems will be done as part of their implementation process 
test plans have been written  with verification testing projected to be completed by september  we have successfully completed yk testing of a suite of applications currently providing service to many of the key business units 
in addition  the data processing infrastructure which includes mainframe  network and server related equipment  has been tested and validated as compliant 
phase implementation this phase involves the deployment of the appropriate yk compliant strategy based on the results of the assessment  renovation and validation phases 
year risks and contingency plans the majority of the it hardware and infrastructure is less than years old  minimizing exposure to yk issues 
this inventory is being checked against vendor provided yk information for validation 
also  we intend that all new hardware and software acquisitions are represented and warranted by the vendors as yk compliant and that any systems developed by in house programmers will continue to be created using yk compliant tools  platforms  and procedures 
we have contacted suppliers who provide necessary goods and services  including banking institutions who provide financial services  to evaluate their yk compliance plans 
as responses are received  their responses are reviewed and evaluated to ensure that no yk related event will materially impede the ability of our suppliers to continue to provide needed goods and services as the year is approached and reached 
we believe all responses received indicate that these goods and services are  or will be  year compliant 
the failure of our suppliers to address their yk issues on a timely basis may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
based upon the current status  we have targeted the end of september for completion of our yk compliance program 
however  no assurance can be given that we will meet this time frame 
we currently estimate that the costs directly associated with the yk compliance program will be approximately million 
this budgeted amount does not include the costs associated with the replacement systems as referenced in phase the funds necessary to complete the systems replacement project and the yk compliance program are included in the information technology operating budget 
approximately million of the amount budgeted for costs directly associated with the yk compliance program have been expended as of june  we are in the process of developing a contingency plan that will be used in the event that any hardware  software or other computer systems  or those of our vendors are not yk compliant  based on risks identified as a result of the assessment and testing phase of our year compliance program 
while we fully expect that the precautions being taken will prepare us for entering year  there is always the potential for risk 
our failure or any of our material suppliers failure to bring their systems into year compliance on a timely basis may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
fourth quarter results for the fourth quarter of fiscal  net income increased million  or  to million from million for the comparable period of fiscal basic earnings per common share increased to on average common shares of  compared to per share on average common shares of  for the comparable period of fiscal diluted earnings per common share increased to on average common shares of  compared to per share on average common shares of  for the comparable period of fiscal the increases in net income and earnings per share primarily resulted from the impact of increases in the volume of loans and leases securitized during the periods and increases in the collection of fee income due to the increase in the total managed portfolio 
recent accounting pronouncements set forth below are recent accounting pronouncements which may have a future effect on operations 
these pronouncements should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies  which have been adopted  that are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
at the time of issuance sfas no 
was to be effective on a prospective basis for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  subsequently  the effective date of the standard was delayed until years beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
