strategic initiatives in november the company completed the acquisition of all products and the business of sms holding gmbh sms  the largest european based programmer company 
sms  a privately held company headquartered in wangen  germany  with revenues of approximately million for the months ended october and million in  specializes in device programmers for engineering and manufacturing 
the company paid approximately million in cash for sms and assumed approximately million of liabilities 
the acquisition was made to add to data i o s product offerings  especially in multi site or gang logic programmers and automated handlers where the company has sought to strengthen its product portfolio 
some of data i o s own products  which have experienced declining sales and low margins as they have aged  will be replaced in the data i o product line by sms products 
related to the acquisition of sms  in november the company acquired a license from unmanned solutions  inc usi  a california company  for the technology  manufacturing and worldwide distribution rights to unmanned solutions ah robotic handler 
for this license the company paid  the unmanned solutions handler is used in the sms fine pitch automated programming system  and is a high performance  low cost handler 
these rights were obtained in order to insure availability of the ah in support of future sales of sms s fine pitch automated programmer 
the company pursued these strategic initiatives after assessing the overall market for device programming systems  the strength of the company s product portfolio and product development programs  and the strengths and vulnerabilities of its competitors 
this assessment led to the conclusions that the market for programming systems has become very fragmented and that the overall market may be declining in size 
in addition  with the increasing emphasis in the market on low cost  limited purpose programming solutions  the company s product portfolio did not appear to be well matched to the future requirements of the market 
also  the gross margins for the company s products in this market have eroded and are expected to continue to erode 
as a result of these conclusions  continuing delays in and cancellation of product development projects  the high costs associated with supporting aging products  declining sales and other factors  the board of directors determined to commence a significant restructuring of the company s operations  discontinue certain products and development projects and investigate means to improve the company s competitive position 
the sms and usi transactions were intended to fill certain gaps in the company s product lines and provide replacements for certain aging  low margin products while focusing on development of a next generation programming platform 
the company intends to continue to evaluate business relationships or combinations in the programmer market or in parallel markets and other strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
also  the company is continuing efforts to reverse the decline in sales and to reduce expenses but cannot predict when the company might return to profitability 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
in september the company announced that it had obtained a license to the technology and manufacturing rights from amti esec inc for the ct handler used in the company s promaster r automated fine pitch programming system 
this became necessary due to the decision of amti esec to discontinue production of the ct after it has completed a limited number of units currently in production 
the steps taken by amti esec caused the company to incur additional expenses and increased the risks associated with the in the fourth quarter of the company was able to record revenue on six units after successful completion of certain configuration requirements and performance enhancements 
page business restructuring 
during the third quarter of the company began implementing a business restructuring plan that included a downsizing of its work force by approximately one third  consolidation of company operations in its headquarters facility onto two floors  and other steps to reduce operations to a level more in line with the lower sales it is experiencing 
in the fourth quarter the company announced and implemented further restructuring plans in tandem with the acquisition of sms 
with this restructuring  the company has four principal objectives to reduce its corporate overhead  to reduce research and development expenses and to focus its on going development spending in the segments of the market that show the best potential for growth and return on investment for the company  to create in a more variable cost operating structure including the out sourcing of certain of its manufacturing operations during the second or third quarter of  and to eliminate redundant products and operations after the acquisition of sms 
once this restructuring plan is fully implemented through staff reductions  facility consolidation  reprioritization of research and development efforts and outsourcing of manufacturing  the company intends to focus much of its attention on identifying means to improve its competitive position 
the restructuring plan implementation is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of as part of the restructuring  the company focused its research and development efforts for the second half of on the promaster and on sustaining engineering for the company s existing products  and discontinued development of the promaster and the application of the datasite technology in the general purpose programmer market 
in manufacturing  the company has discontinued production of certain of its non automated programming systems and is reviewing the consolidation of its family of handlers 
the company is also planning to outsource certain of its manufacturing operations during the second or third quarter of together with consolidation of its product offerings  this outsourcing strategy is expected to result in a lower  more flexible cost structure for the company by reducing fixed overhead costs and the robust infrastructure that is required for a manufacturing operation 
in february  the company sold its japan sales and service subsidiary to a former sub distributor who will now continue to distribute the company s products in japan 
additionally  the company continues to realign its operations in germany whereby sms will become the german headquarters and munich will continue as a sales and service office 
operating expenses for included restructuring charges of million related to these restructuring activities 
related primarily to its restructuring plan  the company recorded inventory reserves during of approximately million on products that will be discontinued as a result of the business restructuring 
these inventory reserves are included in cost of goods sold for the third and fourth quarters 
in addition  the company incurred operating expenses of approximately  related to facility consolidation restructuring activities that were included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
cash payments related to this restructuring plan are estimated to be approximately million during the period from the third quarter through approximately of those cash payments will take place from the third quarter of through the first quarter page results of continuing operations for all periods presented in this section  results of operations reflect the classification of the company s semiconductor equipment and synario design automation divisions as discontinued operations see discontinued operations

sales and orders decreased for the company s programming system products during as compared to orders during the year decreased approximately to million  compared with million in the sales and orders declines during the year are attributable to both non automated and automated programming system products  but are primarily attributable to the decline in automated programming systems sales 
sales of the company s pm fine pitch automated programming system  which was developed to replace the pm  were negatively impacted during the year by delays in completion of certain configuration requirements and performance enhancements 
as a result  sales of fine pitch automated programming systems declined million from sales of the company s other automated programming system products  accessories and service contracts decreased by approximately million compared to due primarily to increased competition in areas where these products are nearing the end of their product life cycles 
in november the company completed two strategic transactions intended to fill gaps in the company s product lines and provide replacements for certain of its aging  low margin products while focusing on development of a next generation programming platform see strategic initiatives 
the integration of the sms products into the company s product portfolio  combined with the elimination of certain products  is expected to improve the company s competitive position in the market 
this integration is expected to be largely completed during the first half of however  there is no assurance that this integration will be successful and will result in stabilized sales within this timeframe 
during sales decreased in all geographic regions 
these declines were partially offset by exchange rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen 
the foreign currency exchange rate changes  primarily in the german mark and japanese yen  increased sales by approximately  during as compared to when the us dollar is weaker  sales of the company s products in local currency translate into more us dollars 
however  offsetting the revenue translation impact is the translation of local currency costs and expenses 
vs 
the company experienced an overall decline in sales and orders for the company s programming systems division products during orders declined approximately to million in  compared with million in sales for the programming systems division were negatively impacted due primarily to delays in new product introductions by the company 
in addition  the declines in non automated programming systems also reflect the continuing market shift away from the company s traditional line of higher price ic programmers for the engineering market  toward lower price programmers 
page during international sales were slightly lower as compared to sales decreased in europe  canada and japan  but increased slightly in other parts of the world 
the foreign currency exchange rate changes reduced sales by approximately million during compared to these declines were due primarily to exchange rate changes for the german mark and the japanese yen 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net sales vs 
the gross margin decreased significantly in amount and as a percentage of sales during compared to the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in sales volume and million of inventory reserves for primarily dis continued products recorded during the year related to restructuring activities see strategic initiatives 
the relatively high fixed component of cost of goods sold causes any shift in total volume to have a significant impact on the gross margin percentage 
also contributing to the decline in gross margins are high costs associated with promaster customer support during the year 
vs 
the gross margin increased in amount and as a percentage of sales during compared to the increase in gross margin is due primarily to less inventory reserves recorded in  offset by lower volumes and lower product margins in the shift in mix of product revenues from higher priced and higher margin non automated programming systems to the lower priced alternatives has lowered the overall product gross margins 
also contributing to the decline of gross margin was the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the japanese yen and the german mark  in which approximately of the company s sales were denominated 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net sales vs 
research and development spending increased both in amount and as a percentage of sales 
the increase in spending was primarily due to aggressive spending for new product development through the first half of in engineering staff and materials  and due to incentive programs that were implemented during the second half of the year related to product development programs 
also  spending for consultants used in new product development was increased during  and a vice president of engineering was hired in september as part of the business restructuring plan that was implemented during the third and fourth quarters of  the company shifted its focus to research and development efforts on the promaster and on sustaining engineering for the company s existing products  and discontinued development of the promaster and the application of the datasite technology in the general purpose programmer market 
this restructuring plus the november acquisition of sms has allowed the company to de emphasis its support of certain old products that will be replaced due to product overlap 
the company believes it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
the company is focusing its research and development efforts in its strategic growth markets  namely new programming technology and automated handling systems for the manufacturing environment 
the company expects to continue this focus in the future and believes that it is essential to invest in research and development to support its existing products and to create new products as markets develop and technologies change 
at the time of the acquisition of sms in the company recognized a charge for in process research and development of million 
based on the analysis performed of the in process research and development  the company estimates that approximately million to million will be spent over the next one to two years before this development results in commercially viable products 
page vs 
research and development spending decreased in amount but increased as a percentage of sales in compared to the spending decrease is primarily due to reduced spending on materials related to development projects and open job positions 
the increase as a percentage of sales is due to lower sales volume 
selling  general and administrative in thousands change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales vs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenditures in as compared to is due primarily to a first quarter charge in the amount of  related to the modification of stock options of a former ceo of the company  additional spending in marketing related to new products and promotions during the first half of the year  incremental professional services engaged to assist in strategic planning  additional expenses related to facility consolidation  and expenses related to the search for a new chief executive officer in the first quarter 
this additional spending was partially offset by lower sales commissions due to the lower sales volume during  and by lower spending following the company s restructuring initiatives in the third and fourth quarters of see strategic initiatives 
the company believes that selling  general and administrative expenditures will decrease in amount in due to the restructuring and the sale of the company s japan subsidiary in february vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses during as compared to is primarily due to decreased costs related to the closure of the uk office  decreased travel costs and decreased dollar costs in the company s foreign offices due to the strengthened us dollar  offset by increased commissions due to an increased number of sales representatives in the us and canada

synario r design automation division also in november  the company entered into a licensing agreement and an agreement to sell certain assets of its synario design automation division 
under this licensing agreement  the company s electronic design automation eda products are being integrated and sold with the eda product line of minc incorporated 
this transaction discontinued the synario design automation division operations of the company 
however  the company is entitled to receive and may realize certain licensing revenues related to its abel and ecs products through december  also  the company negotiated a settlement to the oem agreement with synopsys inc  which is reflected in the loss on disposal 
operating results and the loss on the disposal of this segment are as follows in thousands net sales    gain loss from operations  net of income tax    loss on disposal  net of income tax total income loss on discontinued segment    includes net sales of  in for retained licensing rights recognized after the disposition in all net sales are for retained licensing rights 
inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates historically  the company has been able to offset the impact of inflation through efficiency increases and price adjustments 
increasing price competition  especially in ic programmers  is currently diminishing and may continue to diminish the company s ability to offset the impacts of inflation in the future 
sales and expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the subsidiary s local currency and translated into us dollar amounts at average rates of exchange during the year 
to date the foreign currency rate changes have not significantly impacted the company s profitability 
this is because approximately of the company s sales are made by foreign subsidiaries and independent currency fluctuations tend to minimize the translation effect of any individual currency exchange fluctuations  and the effect of individual rate changes on sales and expenses tend to offset each other 
additionally  the company hedges its foreign currency exposure on sales of inventory and certain loans to its foreign subsidiaries through the use of foreign exchange contracts

page financial condition liquidity and capital resources in thousands change change working capital      total debt    working capital decreased during primarily due to restructuring costs  losses from operations  the early settlement of a long term pension obligation  spending on property  plant and equipment  the acquisition of sms in the fourth quarter and a minority interest investment in jtag technologies in the second quarter 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by approximately million during the year funding these activities 
inventory decreased by approximately million due to million of inventory reserves primarily related to discontinued products  offset by an increase in inventory primarily due to the acquisition of sms 
recoverable income taxes increased due to the loss carryback against income taxes paid 
other current assets decreased million in primarily due to the collection of accounts receivable related to the reel tech and synario design automation divisions which were not sold as a part of the disposals of these divisions in november accrued expenses increased by million primarily due to accrual of restructuring charges that will be paid out during as the restructuring plan is fully implemented see strategic initiatives 
income taxes payable decreased during the year due to the payment of the income tax liability from notes payable decreased due to the payment of a million note paid in the first quarter as of december   the company had total debt of  or approximately of its million in equity 
this represented borrowings under its million foreign line of credit which went away with the sale of the company s japan subsidiary in february the company also has another foreign line of credit of  maturing march  with an interest rate of 
at december   the company had an unused million us secured line of credit maturing in may under which borrowings would incur interest at the bank s published prime rate or the libor rate plus basis points 
this line of credit has been structured as short term and the company expects to be able to renew it on its maturity date under substantially the same terms as those presently in place 
no assurances can be made  however  in regard to the renewal of this agreement 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment during will be approximately million 
such expenditures are expected to be funded from internally generated funds and  if necessary  borrowings from the company s existing credit lines 
although the company fully expects that such expenditures will be made  it has commitments for only a small portion of these amounts 
at december   the company s material short term unused sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and available borrowings of million under its us line of credit 
the company believes these sources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient during to fund working capital needs  service existing debt and finance planned capital acquisitions 
share repurchase program under a previously announced share repurchase program  the company is authorized to repurchase up to  shares approximately of its outstanding common stock 
these purchases may be executed through open market purchases at prevailing market prices  through block purchases or in privately negotiated transactions  and may commence or be discontinued at any time 
as of december   the company has repurchased  shares under this repurchase program at a total cost of approximately million 
the company has not repurchased shares under this plan since the second quarter of although it still has the authority to do so 
page general impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities or failure of devices with imbedded technology 
the company has completed an assessment of its data processing systems and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project budget was initially estimated and authorized for approximately million  which included approximately  for new hardware to be capitalized and approximately  of costs to be expensed as incurred 
the company has completed the most significant portion of this phase of the year project and currently estimates that the cost of this project will be less than the initial budgeted amount 
as of december   the company has incurred and expensed approximately  and capitalized approximately  related to this project 
the company believes  based on its current understanding of its systems  that with modifications to the existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue should not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not properly made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the cost of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  cooperation of vendors and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in the area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
the company has also mailed letters to its significant vendors and service providers and has verbally communicated with many strategic customers to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether the products and services purchased from or by such entities are year compliant 
as of december the company had received responses from approximately one third of such third parties and is currently in the process of analyzing the responses 
the company is also in the process of following up with those vendors and service providers which have not responded that are deemed to be critical suppliers  or whose response was unsatisfactory 
this phase of the year project is expected to be completed by the second quarter of the company is also in the process of evaluating its internal systems with imbedded technology that are subject to the year issue 
this evaluation and any required remediation are expected to be completed by december  the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or results of operations 
the company has begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  and such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
the company currently plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning by december  page european monetary conversion on january   the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced the euro  which became a functional legal currency of the emu countries 
during the next three years  business in the emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating in or conducting business in the emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
the company is still assessing the impact the emu formation will have on both its internal systems and its products sold 
the company plans to take appropriate corrective actions based on the results of such assessment 
the costs related to addressing this issue have not been determined  however  management believes that this issue and its related costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
shareholder rights plan in march  the company adopted a shareholder rights plan the rights plan that went into effect simultaneously with the expiration of its previously existing shareholder rights plan 
under the rights plan  a dividend of one share purchase right a right was declared for each share of company common stock outstanding at the close of business on april  in the event that a person or group the acquirer acquires or more of the company s common stock without advance approval by the company s board of directors or more in the case of one group of shareholders  each right will entitle the holder  other than the acquirer  to buy common stock with a market value of twice the right s then current exercise price initially  subject to adjustment 
in addition  if rights are triggered by such a non approved acquisition and the company is thereafter acquired in a merger or other transaction in which the shareholders of the company are not treated equally  shareholders with unexercised rights will be entitled to purchase common stock of the acquirer with a value of twice the exercise price of the rights 
this rights plan is intended to protect the company s shareholders in the case of an unapproved acquisition by allowing the holder of a right to purchase the company s common stock at of the market price  thereby diluting the ownership percentage of the acquirer 
the company s board of directors may redeem the rights for a nominal amount at any time prior to an event that causes the rights to become exercisable 
the rights trade automatically with the underlying common stock unless and until a distribution event occurs under the rights plan and expire on april  if not redeemed earlier
