item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and the related financial data are presented to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of first commonwealth financial corporation including its subsidiaries the corporation for the years ended december   and and are intended to supplement  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
important factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof 
the corporation undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
the corporation acquired southwest national corporation and its subsidiary southwest effective december  the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests and accordingly  all financial statements have been restated as though the merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
during the fourth quarter of the corporation formed first commonwealth insurance agency fcia as a subsidiary of first commonwealth bank fcb  a commercial banking subsidiary of the corporation 
fcia began marketing a wide range of insurance and annuity products to the corporation s retail and commercial customers beginning january  the corporation acquired bsi financial services inc bsi effective april  the bsi merger was accounted for as a purchase transaction  whereby the results of operations of bsi from the date of acquisition are included in the corporation s financial statements 
results of operations net income in was million  a decrease of million from the level of million and compared to million reported in basic earnings per share decreased per share in to 
the decrease in net income and basic earnings per share for was primarily the result of merger and other related charges of million incurred during these charges include merger expenses for the acquisition of southwest national corporation  early retirement and postretirement benefit accruals and premises and equipment expenses to standardize depreciation methods 
on a net of tax basis the impact of these merger and other related charges decreased earnings per share by in net income and basic earnings per share for also reflected a pre tax decrease of as a result of lower securities gains during compared to levels 
net income and basic earnings per share for were impacted favorably by increases in net interest margin and other income and negatively impacted by an increase in the provision for possible credit losses 
extraordinary items for resulted from a single transaction whereby the corporation incurred a cost of thousand for the prepayment of fhlb term borrowings 
this transaction was executed as part of the corporation s repositioning of its balance sheet to reduce exposure to declining interest rates 
the increase in basic earnings per share of generated during reflected increases in net interest income and securities gains

c loan income includes net loan fees 
d average balances for and do not include reallocations from noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into savings deposits which were made for regulatory purposes 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis both interest income and interest expense increased over levels as volumes increased 
average interest earning assets increased million while average interest bearing liabilities increased million in average loans increased million in and were supported by deposit growth and short term borrowings 
average investments increased million and were funded by long term federal home loan bank borrowings 
asset yields  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased basis points during to from reported in and compared to reported in the decline in loan yields which began in the fourth quarter of has continued throughout and loan yields declined basis points during to from reported for and compared to during the period reflected decreased yields in all loan categories except personal revolving credit loans which reflected an increase of basis points over levels 
the decline in loan yields included declines of basis points for mortgage loans  basis points for installment loans and basis points for home equity loans 
the mortgage portfolio continues to be impacted by loan refinancings and loans maturing at higher interest rates than current market rates 
loan yields on innovative loan products introduced in previous years which bear lower introductory interest rates began to increase during as these products aged and introductory interest rates were no longer offered on aged loans but since many of these loans are still at introductory rates these products continue to generate lower yields than the mortgage loan portfolio as a whole 
although loan yields declined during  interest income on loans increased million over levels as a result of increases due to volume of million which were partially offset by decreases due to rate of million 
interest income on investments increased million during primarily as a result of increases due to volume of million and increases due to rate of million for us government agency securities 
average balances of us government agency securities for increased million over averages as part of a capital management leveraging strategy whereby borrowings from the federal home loan bank classified as long term debt were invested in us government agency securities 
yields on investments for the period reflected an increase of basis points over yields and included an increase on us government agency securities of basis points for the period compared to although prepayments of mortgage backed securities mbs continued to increase during over levels  these prepayments have not increased beyond acceptable levels 
the primary risk of owning mbs relates to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact on prepayment speeds 
as interest rates increase  prepayment speeds generally decline  resulting in a longer average life of a mbs 
conversely as interest rates decline  prepayment speeds increase  resulting in a shorter average life of a mbs 
using computer simulation models  the corporation tests the average life and yield volatility of all mbs s under various interest rate scenarios on a continuing basis to insure that volatility falls within acceptable limits 
the corporation holds no high risk securities nor does the corporation own any securities of a single issuer exceeding of shareholders equity other than us government and agency securities 
the cost of funds for increased basis points over costs of and compared to costs of for interest on deposits increased million in and included increases in interest bearing demand deposits of million which were partially offset by decreases in interest on savings accounts of million compared to levels 
average interest bearing demand deposits for increased million over averages 
this increase in interest bearing demand deposits for occurred primarily in a secured cash manager product utilized by municipalities 
this secured cash manager product allows the municipality to sweep excess balances from noninterest bearing accounts into an interest bearing account which offers higher interest rates than traditional now accounts 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis continued interest expense on short term borrowings increased million during primarily as a result of increases in average borrowings of million over averages 
increases in interest expense on long term debt of million during were primarily a result of increases in average borrowings of million over averages 
the long term debt increase for was a result of borrowings from the federal home loan bank with maturities of up to years to be utilized as part of the above mentioned capital management leveraging strategy 
the average spread of this leverage strategy was approximately during the period 
during interest income before taxes on these investments exceeded the funding costs by million 
net interest margin net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets  was during compared to in and in the corporation s use of computer modeling to manage interest rate risk is described in the interest sensitivity section of this discussion herein

the amount of the provision is determined by management based upon its assessment of the size and quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance in relation to the risks inherent within the loan portfolio 
the provision for possible credit losses was million in compared to million in and million in this brought the allowance for possible credit losses to million at december   for a ratio of of actual loans outstanding 
although net charge offs for reflect a decrease of thousand over levels  net charge offs have not returned to historic levels  therefore the additional provision of million in the fourth quarter of reflects changing economic conditions 
net charge offs for reflected decreases in consumer installment and revolving credit loans of thousand and commercial loans not secured by real estate of thousand which were partially offset by increases in net charge offs of auto leases of thousand 
net charge offs against the allowance for possible credit losses were million  or of average total loans in this compared to million in and million in net charge offs were and of average total loans during and  respectively 
net charge offs as a percent of average total loans exceed peer averages when comparing the corporation results at december  to the most recent peer averages from september  the peer group was defined as all bank holding companies in the country with assets ranging between billion and billion 
although the allowance for possible credit losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding is below peer averages the additional provision recorded in the fourth quarter of brings the ratio closer to peer when comparing the corporation s first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis ratio from december  to the most recent peer averages from september  for an analysis of credit quality  see the credit review section of this discussion

these securities were sold to reduce the exposure to accelerated prepayments as interest rates were expected to fall 
the million proceeds from the sale of securities in the third quarter of were used to reduce outstanding federal funds purchased while the million proceeds in the fourth quarter were reinvested in higher yielding municipal securities 
the securities gains also included the first quarter sale of us treasury securities classified as securities available for sale having a book value of million with the proceeds being reinvested in mortgage backed and other us government agency securities with similar average expected maturities 
securities losses of thousand were incurred during the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of the sale of mutual funds classified as equity securities having a book value of million 
additional security gains were incurred during the fourth quarter of as a result of the sale of pennsylvania bank stocks having a book value of million 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis the securities gains during and resulted primarily from the sale of investments in pennsylvania bank stocks 
these equity securities had book values of million and million and were sold for gains of million and million during and respectively 
trust income reflected an increase in of thousand over levels as the book value of assets managed continued to increase 
the increase in trust income occurred primarily in fees from employee benefit accounts  agency custodial accounts and retail mutual fund commissions and trailer fees 
service charges on deposits decreased by thousand during but are expected to increase during as fee schedules for the corporation s subsidiary banks are evaluated and standardized 
service charges on deposits increased during  primarily as a result of changes in the fee structure and introduction of a debit card product at southwest bank 
other income increased million in to million from million reported in and can be compared to million in included in the increase in other revenue for were increases in gains on sales of assets of million over levels 
the corporation sold million of family residential mortgage loans during the fourth quarter of which resulted in a gain of million 
the corporation mitigated prepayment risk through the sale of mortgage loans bearing higher interest rates than current market rates and reduced interest rate risk through the sale of mortgage loans bearing interest rates which were lower than current market rates 
as a result of branch analysis including the evaluation of the potential sale or consolidation of branches competing in the same market area  the corporation sold two of its branches located in state college  pennsylvania 
the premium on sale of million of deposits from the state college branches resulted in a gain of thousand in the fourth quarter of other revenue continued to be favorably impacted by income from the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance which increased by million during insurance commissions  primarily those generated from fcia increased thousand during compared to charges for non customer use of the corporation s atms continued to favorably impact other revenue  reflecting an increase of thousand for over levels 
additional increases in other revenue for occurred in mac and debit card income  charge card merchant discount and charge card equipment rental compared to revenues 
total other operating expenses increased million to million in and compared to million and million in and  respectively 
employee costs were million for  reflecting an increase of million over million reported in and compared to million reported in the most notable increase in employee benefit costs for over levels was an increase in health insurance costs due to a rate increase 
salary and benefit increases of million for compared to reflected merit increases  an increase in full time equivalent employees and the inclusion of bsi for twelve months of decreases in deferred loan origination costs also increased employee costs for over levels 
although employee costs in dollars has increased  employee costs as a percentage of average assets has continued to decline to for from in and in salary levels are generally maintained through attrition management programs 
net occupancy and furniture and equipment costs decreased thousand during after reflecting an increase of thousand during all categories of occupancy expense reflected decreases during while furniture and equipment expense included decreases in maintenance and repairs which were partially offset by an increase in depreciation during net occupancy and furniture and equipment expense increases for resulted primarily from increases in building rental expense  building repairs  and depreciation 
these increases were primarily the result of the construction of new branches during and as well as remodeling of existing branches 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis outside data processing expenses were million for compared to million and million for and respectively 
outside data processing expenses would be expected to decline in the future when outsourced processing for southwest bank is converted to the corporation s data processing subsidiary 
pennsylvania shares tax expense increased thousand during and thousand in as shareholder s equity of subsidiary banks continued to rise 
fdic expenses which are included in other operating expenses  decreased thousand for and million for merger expenses incurred during the acquisition of southwest national corporation for legal  accounting  printing  filing and other professional services total million and were expensed during the fourth quarter of as part of the evaluation of appropriate staffing levels for the corporation after inclusion of southwest  an early retirement plan was offered to employees during the fourth quarter of salary and benefit costs of the early retirement plan in the amount of million are included in merger and other related charges for  as approximately of employees took advantage of this opportunity 
the success of the early retirement plan accelerated the process of right sizing the corporation beyond normal attrition management by adjusting employment levels quickly while continuing the corporation s tradition of not laying off employees due to merger activity 
in anticipation of the merger of southwest benefit plans into those of the corporation in the near future  southwest curtailed their postretirement benefit plan during the fourth quarter of an additional accrual adjustment of million related to this curtailment is included in merger and other related charges for additional merger and other related charges of thousand were incurred during to standardize depreciation for southwest to that of the corporation and to write off signs and supplies that become obsolete as a result of the merger 
other operating expenses increased million during to million and compared to million reported in and million reported in lease residual insurance costs  operational losses and charge offs and software depreciation and maintenance expenses for reflected increases of thousand  thousand and thousand respectively over levels 
loan processing expenses increased thousand for compared to  while accelerated prepayment speeds for loans in the fourth quarter of resulted in an increase in the amortization of purchased mortgage servicing rights of thousand over amortization 
other professional fees for increased thousand over amounts recorded for outside professionals were contracted under limited engagements to review the corporation s asset liability management model  analyze fee structures and recommend modifications and to provide research and consulting services for marketing  customer profitability analysis and branch automation initiatives 
it is anticipated that the use of outside professionals for these types of limited engagements will decline in the future as both southwest and the corporation benefit from the combined resources and talents available as a result of the merger 
other professional fees for also reflected increases due to the inclusion of fcia expenses for the period 
income tax expense was million during representing a decrease of million over the total of million and compared to million in the decrease in income tax expense for resulted primarily from an increase in tax free income and a decrease in income before taxes due to early retirement and other merger related charges incurred during income tax expense increased million during the corporation s effective tax rate was for compared to for and for the decrease in the corporation s effective tax rate for resulted primarily from an increase in tax free income  including income from tax free investment securities and bank owned life insurance 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis liquidity liquidity is a measure of the corporation s ability to efficiently meet normal cash flow requirements of both borrowers and depositors 
in the ordinary course of business  funds are generated from deposits primary source and the maturity or repayment of earning assets  such as securities and loans 
as an additional secondary source  short term liquidity needs may be provided through the use of overnight federal funds purchased  borrowings through the use of lines available for repurchase agreements  and borrowings from the federal reserve bank 
additionally  the banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank and may borrow under overnight and term borrowing arrangements 
the sale of earning assets may also provide an additional source of liquidity 
the corporation s long term liquidity source is a large core deposit base and a strong capital position 
core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity a bank can have due to the long term relationship with a deposit customer 
increased competition from nonbanking sources such as mutual funds may require banks to shift to alternative funding from other borrowings 
although this is not significant at the end of  it could become more consequential in the future 
core deposits increased million in while total deposits increased million for non core deposits  which are time deposits in denominations of thousand or more represented of total deposits at december   down from of total deposits at december  non core deposits increased by million in primarily as a result of an increase in public funds 
time deposits of thousand or more at december   and had remaining maturities as follows maturity distribution of large certificates of deposit dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent remaining maturity months or less    over months through months    over months through months    over months    total    net loans decreased million during as consumer installment and real estate loans secured by residential properties decreased by million and million respectively compared to year end the reduction in residential real estate loans was the result of the sale of mortgage loans including the sale of million during the fourth quarter of as discussed previously  the sale of these loans allowed the corporation to reduce interest rate and prepayment risk 
although not reflected in year end balances  the volume of residential mortgage loans originated during remained strong 
new mortgage loan product offerings scheduled for are expected to have a favorable impact on loan volumes 
the reduction in loans to individuals during was due in part to a decrease in indirect auto loans at southwest 
competitive rates and aggressive marketing programs for loans to individuals including indirect auto lending at southwest are planned for first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis below is a schedule of loans by classification for the five years ended december  loans by classification dollar amounts in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction      real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      net leases      gross loans and leases      unearned income      total loans  and leases net of unearned income      an additional source of liquidity is marketable securities that the corporation holds in its investment portfolio 
these securities are classified as securities available for sale 
while the corporation does not have specific intentions to sell these securities  they have been designated as available for sale because they may be sold for the purpose of obtaining future liquidity  for management of interest rate risk or as part of the implementation of tax management strategies 
as of december   securities available for sale had an amortized cost of billion and an approximate fair value of billion 
gross unrealized gains were million and gross unrealized losses were million 
based upon the corporation s historical ability to fund liquidity needs from other sources  the current available for sale portfolio is deemed to be more than adequate  as the corporation does not anticipate a need to liquidate the investments until maturity 
below is a schedule of the contractual maturity distribution of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale at december  maturity distribution of securities held to maturity dollar amounts in thousands states and total weighted us government agencies political other amortized average and corporations subdivisions securities cost yield within year    after but within years     after but within years    after years    total     maturity distribution of securities available for sale at amortized cost dollar amounts in thousands us treasury  and other states and total weighted us government agencies political other amortized average and corporations subdivisions securities cost yield within year    after but within years    after but within years     after years     total     yields are calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis interest sensitivity the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to maintain an appropriate balance between the stable growth of income and the risks associated with maximizing income through interest sensitivity imbalances 
while no single number can accurately describe the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  interest rate sensitivity positions  or gaps when measured over a variety of time periods may be helpful 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest sensitive if the rate it yields or bears is subject to change within a predetermined time period 
if interest sensitive assets isa exceeds interest sensitive liabilities isl during a prescribed time period  a positive gap results 
conversely  when isl exceeds isa during a time period  a negative gap results 
a positive gap tends to indicate that earnings will be impacted favorably if interest rates rise during the period and negatively when interest rates fall during the time period 
a negative gap tends to indicate that earnings will be affected inversely to interest rate changes 
in other words  as interest rates fall  a negative gap should tend to produce a positive effect on earnings and when interest rates rise  a negative gap should tend to affect earnings negatively 
the primary components of isa include adjustable rate loans and investments  loan repayments  investment maturities and money market investments 
the primary components of isl include maturing certificates of deposit  money market deposits  savings deposits  now accounts and short term borrowings 
the following table lists the amounts and ratios of assets and liabilities with rates or yields subject to change within the periods indicated as of december  and dollar amounts in thousands cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets cumulative days days days days loans     investments     other interest earning assets     total interest sensitive assets     certificates of deposit     other deposits   borrowings     total interest sensitive liabilities     gap     isa isl gap total assets first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis although the periodic gap analysis provides management with a method of measuring current interest rate risk  it only measures rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
therefore  to more precisely measure the impact of interest rate changes on the corporation s net interest income  management simulates the potential effects of changing interest rates through computer modeling 
the income simulation model used by the corporation captures all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments  accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these variables include prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  cash flows from loans  deposits and investments and balance sheet growth assumptions 
the model also captures embedded options  such as interest rate caps floors or call options  and accounts for changes in rate relationships as various rate indices lead or lag changes in market rates 
the corporation is then better able to implement strategies which would include an acceleration of a deposit rate reduction or lag in a deposit rate increase 
the repricing strategies for loans would be inversely related 
the corporation s asset liability management policy guidelines limit interest rate risk exposure for the succeeding twenty four month period 
simulations are prepared under the base case where interest rates remain flat and most likely case where interest rates are defined using projections of economic factors 
additional simulations are produced estimating the impact on net interest income of a basis point movement upward or downward from the base case scenario 
the corporation s current asset liability management policy indicates that a basis point change in interest rates up or down cannot result in more than a change in net interest income when compared to a base case without board approval and a strategy in place to reduce interest rate risk below the established maximum level 
the analysis at december   indicated that a basis point movement in interest rates in either direction over the next twelve months would not have a significant impact on the corporation s anticipated net interest income over that time nor over the next twenty four months and the corporation s position would remain well within current policy guidelines 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco is responsible for the identification  assessment and management of interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  capital adequacy and investment portfolio position 
the primary objective of the alco process is to ensure that the corporation s balance sheet structure maintains prudent levels of risk within the context of currently known and forecasted economic conditions and to establish strategies which provide the corporation with appropriate compensation for the assumption of those risks 
the alco attempts to mitigate interest rate risk through the use of strategies such as asset disposition  asset and liability pricing and matched maturity funding 
the alco strategies are established by the corporation s senior management and are approved by the corporation s board of directors 
final loan maturities and rate sensitivity of the loan portfolio excluding consumer installment and mortgage loans and before unearned income at december  were as follows dollar amounts in thousands within one one to after year years years total commercial and industrial     financial institutions real estate construction     real estate commercial     other     totals     loans at fixed interest rates   loans at variable interest rates   totals   first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis credit review maintaining a high quality loan portfolio is of great importance to the corporation 
the corporation manages the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio through the use of prudent lending policies and procedures and monitors risk through a periodic review process provided by internal auditors  regulatory authorities and our loan review staff 
these reviews include the analysis of credit quality  diversification of industry  compliance to policies and procedures  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
in the management of its credit portfolio  the corporation emphasizes the importance of the collectibility of loans and leases as well as asset and earnings diversification 
the corporation immediately recognizes as a loss all credits judged to be uncollectible and has established an allowance for possible credit losses that may exist in the portfolio at a point in time  but have not been specifically identified 
the corporation s written lending policy requires certain underwriting standards to be met prior to funding any loan  including requirements for credit analysis  collateral value coverage  documentation  and terms 
the principal factor used to determine potential borrowers creditworthiness is business cash flows or consumer income available to service debt payments 
secondary sources of repayment  including collateral or guarantees  are frequently obtained 
the lending policy provides limits for individual and bank committees lending authorities 
in addition to the bank loan approval process  requests for borrowing relationships which will exceed one million dollars must also be approved by the corporation s credit committee 
this committee consists of a minimum of three members of the corporation s board of directors 
commercial and industrial loans are generally granted to small and middle market customers for operating  expansion or asset acquisition purposes 
operating cash flows of the business enterprise are identified as the principal source of repayment  with business assets held as collateral 
collateral margins and loan terms are based upon the purpose and structure of the transaction as set forth in loan policy 
commercial real estate loans are granted for the acquisition or improvement of real property 
generally  commercial real estate loans do not exceed of the appraised value of property pledged to secure the transaction 
repayment of such loans are expected from the operations of the subject real estate and are carefully analyzed prior to approval 
additional credit review procedures regarding year issues were established for commercial loan customers during these procedures include the gathering of information to evaluate new customers year risk and modifying loan covenants to mitigate the corporation s credit risk due to loan customers failure to remediate their year issues 
all current commercial loan customers were contacted by direct mail to increase customer awareness of how the year date change may affect them 
credit risk inherent in the existing loan portfolio related to year issues was assessed through review of the corporation s largest commercial credits 
in addition to direct mail contact  large commercial customers were contacted by phone to improve awareness and to gather information needed for evaluation of year credit risk 
economic factors used in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for possible credit losses have also been expanded to include the impact of year problems 
real estate construction loans are granted for the purposes of constructing improvements to real property  both commercial and residential 
on site inspections are conducted by qualified individuals prior to periodic permanent project financing  which is generally committed prior to the commencement of construction financing 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis real estate loans secured by family residential housing properties are granted subject to statutory limits in effect for each bank regarding the maximum percentage of appraised value of the mortgaged property 
residential loan terms are normally established in compliance with secondary market requirements 
residential mortgage portfolio interest rate risk is controlled by secondary market sales  variable interest rate loans and balloon maturities 
loans to individuals represent financing extended to consumers for personal or household purposes  including automobile financing  education  home improvement  and personal expenditures 
these loans are granted in the form of installment  credit card  or revolving credit transactions 
consumer creditworthiness is evaluated on the basis of ability to repay  stability of income sources  and past credit history 
since all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for possible credit losses is restricted to any individual credit or groups of credits  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all credit losses 
however  for analytical purposes  the following table sets forth an allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses at december according to the categories indicated allocation of the allowance for possible credit losses dollar amounts in thousands commercial  industrial  financial  agricultural and other      real estate construction real estate commercial      real estate residential      loans to individuals      lease financing receivables unallocated      total      allowance as percentage of average total loans the unallocated portion of the allowance for possible credit losses increased to million for from million reported in the unallocated portion of the allowance for possible credit losses represented of the total allowance for compared to of the total allowance for and is more in line with historical levels 
although net charge offs have decreased for the period compared to levels  net charge offs for became higher than peer averages 
the allowance for possible credit losses at december  provides for this change in the corporation s trend in credit loss experience exceeding peers  rather than continuation of the historic trend which has been favorable in comparison to peers 
the corporation continues to monitor changing economic conditions and their potential impact on credit risk and based on this analysis deemed it appropriate to provide for these economic conditions by increasing the provision for possible credit losses in the fourth quarter of this increase brings the allowance for possible credit losses  which has historically lagged behind peer levels closer to peer averages when comparing actual results from december  to the most recent peer results available from september  other than those described below  there are no material credits that management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table identifies nonperforming loans at december a loan is placed in a nonaccrual status at the time when ultimate collectibility of principal or interest  wholly or partially  is in doubt 
past due loans are those loans which were contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments but are well secured and in the process of collection 
renegotiated loans are those loans which terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest as a result of the deteriorating financial position of the borrower

the level of nonperforming loans at year end remains stable in dollar amount when compared to levels 
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased over levels but is in line with historic levels 
the increase in this ratio is due in part to the reduction in outstanding loans at december  the ratio of the allowance for possible credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans at december  was an increase over levels 
management believes that the allowance for possible credit losses and nonperforming loans remained safely within acceptable levels 
capital resources equity capital increased million in to million

the evaluation of capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  earnings history and prospects  internal controls and management caliber 
in consideration of these factors  management s primary emphasis with respect to the corporation s capital position is to maintain an adequate and stable ratio of equity to assets 
see note for an analysis of regulatory capital guidelines and the corporation s capital ratios relative to these measurement standards 
year analysis the year issue is the result of computer programs being written whereby dates have been abbreviated by eliminating the first two digits of the year under the assumption that these two digits would always be any computer systems that have date sensitive programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year as the year approaches such systems will be unable to accurately process certain date based information resulting in potential system failure or miscalculations 
during the corporation began evaluating the size and complexity of the year issue 
an awareness effort to inform board of directors  senior management and other staff of the year problem and its significance began  and communications continue to provide progress updates 
the corporation completed an inventory process and developed a plan for addressing the year issue 
the plan addressed mainframe and pc based hardware and software systems and was later expanded to include environmental systems that are dependent on embedded microchips 
examples of environmental systems are vaults  security systems  elevators  telephones  heating and electrical systems 
project teams were established to identify and prioritize critical systems and processes affected by the year date change 
critical mainframe and pc based hardware and software systems were assessed for year readiness and those with identified date issues were scheduled for modification or replacement 
significant suppliers and outside professional service contractors were also evaluated to determine the extent to which the corporation is vulnerable to those parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
by fully dedicating numerous technical staff from commonwealth systems corporation  the corporation s data processing subsidiary and utilizing additional staff from various functional areas  multiple computer systems can be addressed concurrently 
renovation whereby code enhancements  hardware and software upgrades and system replacements are implemented was complete for mission critical systems at december  an application is considered mission critical if it is vital to the successful continuation of a core business activity 
validation or testing of all changes to hardware and software components  including connections with other systems was complete at year end  while implementation of mission critical systems was approximately completed by the same time frame 
mission critical systems not in a state of readiness are primarily smaller pc based systems 
all mission critical systems are scheduled for implementation by march  which places the corporation within guidelines established by federal regulatory agencies 
regulatory agencies will continue to perform quarterly reviews of the corporation s year readiness throughout the corporation has also engaged outside professionals to provide additional independent verification and validation processes and to assure the reliability of internal risk and cost estimates 
first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis year analysis continued due to the broad scope of risks and uncertainties associated with the year problem the corporation established a separate business resumption plan for year events which is integrated with its general business resumption plan 
the corporation s remediation contingency plan addresses major identifiable internal and external components and identifies alternative processes in event that a system fails 
third party vendors have been evaluated and outside sources have been tested where possible 
contingencies established for critical systems and processes include manual processing of transactions  utilization of tape transfer rather than electronic medium  use of alternate communications lines or methods and the installation of a generator as a backup power source 
contingencies for communication with customers include maintaining access to the corporation s telephone banking center by relocation of the center if necessary 
short term liquidity needs have been estimated and multiple sources of funds have been identified 
contingency planning will continue throughout and although all possible problems can not possibly be anticipated  management believes that potential difficulties associated with implementation are likely to result in only minor delays in transaction or information availability 
the corporation s greatest asset in dealing with year issues continues to be its dedicated staff who enable the corporation to redirect internal resources as needed 
the corporation utilized internal resources to evaluate  reprogram and test software and hardware for year issues to the extent possible 
salary and benefit costs related to year activities were expensed as incurred 
external year expenditures included amounts for capitalized hardware and software which will be amortized over three years for software and five years for hardware 
in most cases the new software and hardware offer additional benefits in processing capability or efficiencies gained from modernization in addition to achieving year compliance 
mainframe software and hardware replaced will result in enhancements or features of potential benefit in serving banking customers or processing financial transactions 
year expenditures which were expensed as incurred during included the cost of leased off site testing of mainframe systems  outside professionals utilized for independent verification  travel and lodging during off site testing and vendor testing 
the corporation s estimates of additional year expenditures to be incurred during are based on presently available information and estimates 
cash outlays were funded through operating cash flows 
due to the corporation s commitment to mitigate year risks where possible  management does not believe the year problem will have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
the following table summarizes year expenditures during and and estimated amounts to be incurred during estimate for capitalized hardware and software non employee expenses including testing employee related costs  subtotal  capitalized hardware and software replaced without acceleration due to year  total expenditures   first commonwealth financial corporation and subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis inflation and changing prices management is aware of the impact inflation has on interest rates and therefore the impact it can have on a bank s performance 
the ability of a financial institution to cope with inflation can only be determined by analysis and monitoring of its asset and liability structure 
the corporation monitors its asset and liability position with particular emphasis on the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to reduce the effect of inflation upon its performance 
however  it must be remembered that the asset and liability structure of a financial institution is substantially different from an industrial corporation in that virtually all assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  meaning that they have been or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in general price levels 
examples of monetary items include cash  loans and deposits 
nonmonetary items are those assets and liabilities which do not gain or lose purchasing power solely as a result of general price level changes 
examples of nonmonetary items are premises and equipment 
inflation can have a more direct impact on categories of noninterest expenses such as salaries and wages  supplies and employee benefit costs 
these expenses are very closely monitored by management for both the effects of inflation and increases relating to such items as staffing levels  usage of supplies and occupancy costs
