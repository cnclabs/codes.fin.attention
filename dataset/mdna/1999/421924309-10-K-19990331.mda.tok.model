each of the asc acquisition  the horizon cms acquisition  the nia acquisition and the columbia hca acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the acquired operations are included in the company s consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
each of the sca acquisition  the advantage health acquisition  the health images acquisition and the nsc acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  with the exception of data set forth relating to revenues derived from medicare and medicaid  all amounts shown in the following discussion have been restated to reflect such acquisitions 
sca  advantage health  health images and nsc did not separately track such revenues 
the pscm acquisition and the readicare acquisition were also accounted for as poolings of interests 
however  due to the immateriality of pscm and readicare  the company s historical financial statements for all periods prior to the quarters in which the respective mergers took place have not been restated 
instead  stockholders equity has been increased during to reflect the effects of the pscm acquisition and the readicare acquisition 
the results of operations of pscm and readicare are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the following discussion from the date of acquisition forward see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company determines the amortization period of the cost in excess of net asset value of purchased facilities based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each individual purchase transaction 
the evaluation includes an analysis of historic and projected financial performance  an evaluation of the estimated useful life of the buildings and fixed assets acquired  the indefinite useful life of certificates of need and licenses acquired  the competition within local markets  lease terms where applicable  and the legal terms of partnerships where applicable 
the company utilizes independent appraisers and relies on its own management expertise in evaluating each of the factors noted above 
in connection with recent developments  including changes in the reimbursement environment in the healthcare industry  the closing or consolidation of certain of its locations  and the integration of some of its purchased facilities in connection with implementation of its integrated service model strategy  the company is undertaking a comprehensive review of its amortization policies with respect to the excess of cost over net asset value of purchased facilities 
this review may result in future changes in certain of the company s accounting estimates following completion of such review 
with respect to the carrying value of the excess of cost over net asset value of individual purchased facilities and other intangible assets  the company determines on a quarterly basis whether an impairment event has occurred by considering factors such as the market value of the asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action by regulators  a history of operating losses or cash flow losses  or a projection of continuing losses associated with an operating entity 
the carrying value of excess cost over net asset value of purchased facilities and other intangible assets will be evaluated if the facts and circumstances suggest that it has been impaired 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the asset will not be recoverable  as determined based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity acquired over the remaining amortization period  the company s carrying value of the asset will be reduced by the estimated shortfall of cash flows to the estimated fair market value 
in  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires an enterprise to report operating segments based upon the way its operations are managed 
this approach defines operating segments along the lines used by management to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions 
based on the company s management and reporting structure  segment information has been presented for inpatient and other clinical services and outpatient services 
the inpatient and other clinical services segments includes the operations of its inpatient rehabilitation facilities and medical centers  as well as the operations of certain physician practices and other clinical services which are managerially aligned with the company s inpatient services 
the company has aggregated the financial results of its outpatient rehabilitation facilities including occupational health centers  outpatient surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers into the outpatient services segment 
these three types of facilities have common economic characteristics  provide similar services  serve a similar class of customers  cross utilize administrative services and operate in a similar regulatory environment 
in addition  the company s integrated service model strategy combines these services in a seamless environment for the delivery of patient care on an episodic basis 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for financial data for each of the company s operating segments 
the company s revenues include net patient service revenues and other operating revenues 
net patient service revenues are reported at estimated net realizable amounts from patients  insurance companies  third party payors primarily medicare and medicaid and others for services rendered 
revenues from third party payors also include estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements which are subject to final review and settlement by appropriate authorities 
management determines allowances for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments based on historical experience and the terms of payor contracts 
net accounts receivable include only those amounts estimated by management to be collectible 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from private and governmental third party payors 
the company s reimbursement from governmental third party payors is based upon cost reports and other reimbursement mechanisms which require the application and interpretation of complex regulations and policies  and such reimbursement is subject to various levels of review and adjustment by fiscal intermediaries and others  which may affect the final determination of reimbursement 
in addition  there are increasing pressures from many payor sources to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services 
there can be no assurance that payments under governmental and third party payor programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels 
in addition  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of proposals to limit medicare reimbursement for certain services 
the company cannot now predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted or  if adopted and implemented  what effect such proposals would have on the company 
changes in reimbursement policies or rates by private or governmental payors could have an adverse effect on the future results of operations of the company 
the company  in many cases  operates more than one site within a market 
in such markets  there is customarily an outpatient center or inpatient facility with associated satellite outpatient locations 
for purposes of the following discussion and analysis  same store operations are measured on locations within markets in which similar operations existed at the end of the period and include the operations of additional locations opened within the same market 
new store operations are measured on locations within new markets 
the company may  from time to time  close or consolidate similar locations in multi site markets to obtain efficiencies and respond to changes in demand

for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the third quarter of  the company adopted a plan to dispose of or otherwise discontinue substantially all of its home health operations 
the decision to adopt the plan was prompted in large part by the negative impact of the balanced budget act the bba  which placed reimbursement limits on home health businesses 
the limits were announced in march and the company thereafter began to see the adverse affect on home health margins 
the negative trends that occurred as a result in the reduction in reimbursement brought about by the bba caused the company to re evaluate its view of the home health product line 
the plan was approved by the board of directors on september  and all home health operations covered by the plan were closed by december  the company recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately  related to the home health plan 
in addition  the company determined that approximately  in notes receivable and approximately  in accounts receivable would not be collectible as a result of the closing of its home health operations 
these non recurring amounts have been recognized in operating unit expenses and the provision for doubtful accounts  respectively 
the total non recurring charges and expenses included in the results of operations for the year ended december  related to the home health plan was approximately  during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted a plan to dispose of or otherwise substantially discontinue the operations of certain facilities that did not fit with the company s integrated service model strategy see item  business company strategy  underperforming facilities and facilities not located in target markets 
the board of directors approved the plan on december  and as of march   of the identified facilities had been closed 
the company recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately  related to the fourth quarter restructuring plan 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  related to a rehabilitation hospital it had closed and recorded a  loss on the sale of its physical therapy staffing business 
total non recurring charges and expenses included in the results of operations for the year ended december  were approximately  for further discussion  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements

the credit agreement replaced a previous  revolving credit agreement  also with nationsbank 
in conjunction with the credit agreement  the company also canceled its  day interim revolving credit facility with nationsbank 
interest on the credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin  a base rate  or competitively bid rates from the participating banks 
the company is required to pay a fee based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined ratios 
the principal amount is payable in full on june  the company has provided a negative pledge on all assets under the credit agreement 
the effective interest rate on the average outstanding balance under the credit agreement was for the twelve months ended december   compared to the average prime rate of during the same period 
at december   the company had drawn  under the credit agreement 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company also has a short term credit agreement with nationsbank as amended  the short term credit agreement  providing for a  short term revolving credit facility 
the terms of the short term credit agreement are substantially consistent with those of the credit agreement 
interest on the short term credit agreement is paid based on libor plus a predetermined margin or a base rate 
the company is required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility ranging from to  depending on certain defined ratios 
the principal amount is payable in full on february   with an earlier repayment required in the event that the company consummates any public offering or private placement of debt securities 
at december   the company had not drawn down any amounts under the short term credit agreement 
on march   the company issued  in convertible subordinated debentures due the convertible debentures in a private placement 
an additional  principal amount of the convertible debentures was issued on march  to cover underwriters overallotments 
interest is payable on april and october of each year  commencing on october  the convertible debentures are convertible into common stock of the company at the option of the holder at a conversion price of per share  subject to the adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures were used by the company to pay down indebtedness outstanding under its other existing credit facilities 
on june   the company issued  in senior notes due and  in senior notes due collectively  the senior notes 
interest is payable on june and december of each year  commencing on december  the senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of the company 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used by the company to pay down indebtedness outstanding under its existing credit facilities 
on february   the company announced a plan to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock over the next months through open market purchases  block trades or privately negotiated transactions 
the company intends to pursue the acquisition or development of additional healthcare operations  including outpatient rehabilitation facilities  inpatient rehabilitation facilities  ambulatory surgery centers  outpatient diagnostic centers and companies engaged in the provision of other complementary services  and to expand certain of its existing facilities 
while it is not possible to estimate precisely the amounts which will actually be expended in the foregoing areas  the company anticipates that over the next twelve months  it will spend approximately  to  on maintenance and expansion of its existing facilities and approximately  to  to repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock  depending on market conditions  and on continued development of the integrated service model 
see item  business company strategy 
although the company is continually considering and evaluating acquisitions and opportunities for future growth  the company has not entered into any agreements with respect to material future acquisitions 
the company believes that existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s estimated cash requirements for the next twelve months  and for the reasonably foreseeable future 
inflation in recent years has not had a significant effect on the company s business  and is not expected to adversely affect the company in the future unless it increases significantly 
exposures to market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
because of its favorable borrowing arrangements and current market conditions  the company currently does not use derivatives  such as swaps or caps  to alter the interest characteristics of its debt instruments and investment securities 
the impact on earnings and value of market risk sensitive financial instruments principally marketable security investments and long term debt is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
the company uses sensitivity analysis models to evaluate these impacts 
the company s investment in marketable securities was  at december   compared to  at december  the investment represents less than of total assets at december  and these securities are generally short term  highly liquid instruments and  accordingly  their fair value approximates cost 
earnings on investments in marketable securities are not significant to the company s results of operations  and therefore any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on future pre tax earnings 
with respect to the company s interest bearing liabilities  approximately  in long term debt at december  is subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  is subject to fixed rates of interest 
this compares to  in long term debt subject to variable rates of interest and  in long term debt subject to fixed rates of interest at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further description 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt  based on discounted cash flow analyses  approximates its carrying value at december  and  except for the convertible debentures  at december  the fair value of the convertible debentures at december  was approximately  based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately  the impact of such a change on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
these amounts are determined considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in the overall level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change 
foreign operations  and the related market risks associated with foreign currency  are currently insignificant to the company s results of operations and financial position 
computer technologies and year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
the issue is whether such code exists in the company s mission critical applications and if that code will produce accurate information to date sensitive calculations after the turn of the century 
the company is involved in an extensive  ongoing program to identify and correct problems arising from the year issues 
the program is broken down into the following categories mission critical computer applications which are internally maintained by the company s information technology department  mission critical computer applications which are maintained by third party vendors  non mission critical applications  whether internally or externally maintained  hardware  embedded applications which control certain medical and other equipment  computer applications of its significant suppliers  and computer applications of its significant payors 
mission critical computer applications are those which are integral to the company s business mission  which have no reasonable manual alternative for producing the same information and results  and the failure of which to produce accurate information and results would have a significant adverse impact on the company 
such applications include the company s general business systems and its patient billing systems 
most of the company s clinical applications are not considered mission critical  because reasonable manual alternatives are available to produce the same information and results for as long as necessary 
the company s review of its internally maintained mission critical applications revealed that such applications contained very few date sensitive calculations 
the revisions to these applications have been completed and tested 
implementation will be completed during the first quarter of the budget for this project is approximately  the company s general business applications are licensed from and maintained by the same vendor 
all such applications are already year compliant 
the coding and testing of all of the company s other externally maintained mission critical applications for year compliance was completed during installation of certain applications is still in process and will be completed by june  the total cost of such installation is estimated to be approximately  the company has reviewed all of its non mission critical applications and determined that some of these applications are not year compliant and will not be made to be compliant 
in such cases  the company has developed manual alternatives to produce the information that such systems currently produce 
the incremental cost of the manual systems is not currently estimated to be material 
the company plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the manual systems before any decisions are made on the replacement of the non compliant applications 
the company has engaged an independent contractor to inventory and test all of its computer hardware for year compliance at an estimated cost of  to  the contractor has completed site visits to each of the company s locations with over five processors 
the company has received the data from the site visits and is currently determining an appropriate remediation plan 
the preliminary estimate of the range of cost to complete a remediation plan is approximately  to  the contractor has sent diskettes containing test programs to each of the company s locations with five or fewer processors 
the data from those locations will be available by april  the cost of remediation for those facilities with five or fewer processors cannot be estimated until the data is complete 
the company has completed its review of embedded applications which control certain medical and other equipment 
as expected  the review revealed that the nature of the company s business is such that any failure of these type applications is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its business 
in particular  the company has focused on reviewing and testing those applications the failure of which would be likely to cause a significant risk of death or serious injury to patients under treatment in the company s facilities  and the company believes that  because of the types of services it primarily provides and the nature of its patient population  there is little likelihood of such an event occurring because of the failure of an embedded application 
the company has sent inquiries to its significant suppliers of equipment and medical supplies concerning the year compliance of their significant computer applications 
responses have been received from over of those suppliers  and no significant problems have been identified 
third requests have been mailed to all non respondents 
the company has also sent inquiries to its significant third party payors 
responses have been received from payors representing over of the company s revenues 
such responses indicate that these payors systems will be year compliant 
third requests have been mailed to non respondents 
the company will continue to evaluate year risks with respect to such payors as additional responses are received 
in that connection  it should be noted that substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from reimbursement by governmental and private third party payors  and that the company is dependent upon such payors evaluation of their year compliance status to assess such risks 
if such payors are incorrect in their evaluation of their own year compliance status  this could result in delays or errors in reimbursement to the company by such payors  the effects of which could be material to the company 
each of the company s facilities is required  by company policy  to maintain a disaster recovery plan 
the management of each facility has been instructed to review and update such facility s specific disaster recovery plan in light of potential local area problems that may occur as a result of year computer failures 
such potential problems include  but are not limited to  interruption and or loss of electrical power and water  breakdowns in telecommunications systems and the inability to transport supplies and or personnel 
the company s primary exposure resides in its inpatient locations  where patients will be in residence during the time that such potential problems may occur 
execution of each facility s disaster recovery plan should mitigate this exposure for a period of ten to fourteen days 
if such potential problems continue to occur after that period of time  the company will have to take actions that are not currently contemplated in the various disaster recovery plans 
it is not currently possible to estimate the cost or scope of such actions 
guidance from the securities and exchange commission requires the company to describe its reasonably likely worst case scenario in connection with year issues 
as discussed above  while there is always the potential risk of serious injury or death resulting from a failure of embedded applications in medical and other equipment used by the company  the company does not believe that such events are reasonably likely to occur 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case to which it would be exposed is that  notwithstanding the company s attempts to obtain year compliance assurance from third party payors  there is a material failure in such payors systems which prevents or substantially delays reimbursement to the company for its services 
in such event  the company would be forced to rely on cash on hand and available borrowing capacity to the extent of any shortfall in reimbursement  and could be forced to incur additional costs for personnel and other resources necessary to resolve any payment issues 
it is not possible at this time to predict the nature or amount of such costs or the materiality of any reimbursement issues that may arise as a result of the failure of payors payment systems  the effect of which could be substantial 
the company continues to endeavor to obtain reliable information from its payors as to their compliance status  and will attempt to adopt and revise its contingency plans for dealing with payment issues if  as and when such issues become susceptible of prediction 
based on the information currently available  the company believes that its risk associated with problems arising from year issues is not significant 
however  because of the many uncertainties associated with year compliance issues  and because the company s assessment is necessarily based on information from third party vendors  payors and suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment is correct or as to the materiality or effect of any failure of such assessment to be correct 
the company will continue with its assessment process as described above and  to the extent that changes in such assessment require it  will attempt to develop alternatives or modifications to its compliance plan described above 
there can  however  be no assurance that such compliance plan  as it may be changed  augmented or modified from time to time  will be successful 
forward looking statements statements contained in this annual report on form k which are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
in addition  the company  through its senior management  from time to time makes forward looking public statements concerning its expected future operations and performance and other developments 
such forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the company s best judgment based upon current information  involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of there can be no assurance that other factors will not affect the accuracy of such forward looking statements or that healthsouth s actual results will not differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward looking statements 
while is impossible to identify all such factors  factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the company include  but are not limited to  changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry at either or both of the federal and state levels  changes or delays in reimbursement for the company s services by governmental or private payors  competitive pressures in the healthcare industry and the company s response thereto  the company s ability to obtain and retain favorable arrangements with third party payors  unanticipated delays in the company s implementation of its integrated service model  general conditions in the economy and capital markets  and other factors which may be identified from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission filings and other public announcements
