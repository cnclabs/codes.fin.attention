item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as a result of the accident  the ensuing extraordinary review of the company s operations by the faa  the suspension of operations in june  and related consequences  the company s results for periods prior to may  are not necessarily reflective of the results to be expected in future periods 
the company s operations for and are also not reflective of results to be expected in future periods 
this comes as a result of the suspension of operations for a significant portion of  reduced service levels during the fourth quarter of and during the year of  incremental costs incurred to reinitiate service to certain markets and to reactivate aircraft taken out of service during the suspension of operations  and the merger of airways corporation into the company in november the company s financial results include the operations of airways corporation only from and after november   the date of the merger 
compared to summary the company recorded a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in the net loss is an impairment charge of million related to the b fleet 
also  included in the net loss is a one time charge of million related to rebranding and shutdown costs 
excluding the charges  operating costs per available seat miles asm decreased from cents to cents primarily due to the company s continued increase in service levels 
during  both asms and revenue passengers enplaned increased to billion and million  respectively  as compared to billion and million for  respectively 
operating revenues total operating revenues in were million as compared to million for the year ending december  the increase is primarily due to the increase in revenue passengers enplaned and a increase in yield the average amount that a passenger pays to fly one mile from cents to cents 
however  the company is currently experiencing aggressive  competitive pressures that could negatively impact future load factors and yields which could ultimately negatively impact the company s operating revenues 
operating expenses flight operations include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than aircraft fuel  maintenance expenses and passenger services expenses 
flight operations expenses were higher for the year ended december  than primarily due to the increase in asms 
the company also reached an agreement with the union representing its pilots  the national pilots association  during that included a pay increase effective may aircraft fuel expenses include both the direct costs of the fuel as well as the cost of delivering fuel into the aircraft 
fuel expense increased primarily due to the increase in consumption offset by a decrease in price per gallon in from cents per gallon to cents per gallon 
maintenance expenses include normal recurring maintenance performed during the year as well as all administrative costs of the maintenance department 
maintenance expenses in increased due to a higher volume in required heavy checks and engine overhauls resulting from an increase in the number of operating aircraft from at december  to at december  station operations expenses include all expenses incurred at the airports  as well as station operations administration and liability insurance 
station operations expenses were higher due to the increase in capacity 
passenger services expenses include flight attendant wages  training  overnight expenses and catering costs 
passenger service cost in increased again due to expanded capacity and costs incurred related to preparations for threatened flight attendant labor actions 
during  the company negotiated a new contract with the union representing its flight attendants  the association of flight attendants  that included pay increase effective october sales and reservations expenses include all of the costs related to recording a sale or reservation 
these expenses include wages and benefits for reservationists  rent  telecommunication charges  credit card fees  arc processing fees and travel agency commissions 
sales and reservations expenses increased due to the increase in commissionable sales and the increase in passenger volume 
effective january  the company revised the salvage value and lives of its dc fleet and related equipment 
the revised salvage values of the company s dc fleet ranges from approximately  to  per aircraft 
the effect of this change for the year ended december   was to increase income by approximately million or per share on a diluted basis 
these estimates more accurately reflect management s expectations of estimated fair values at the anticipated dates of disposal 
in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to accelerate the retirement of its four owned boeing b aircraft as a result of the elimination of their original route system and continued operating losses upon their redeployment to other routes 
the b s will be replaced with b aircraft 
in connection with its decision to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft  which were acquired in the airways merger  the company performed an evaluation to determine  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 whether future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amount of these aircraft and related assets and an allocation of cost in excess of net assets acquired resulting from the airways merger 
sfas no 
requires that when a group of assets being tested for impairment was acquired as part of a business combination that was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  any cost in excess of net assets acquired that arose as part of the transaction must be included as part of the asset grouping 
as a result of the evaluation  management determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount and allocated cost in excess of net assets acquired  and therefore these aircraft are impaired as defined by sfas no 
consequently  the original cost basis of these assets were reduced to reflect the fair market value at the date the decision was made  resulting in a  impairment loss 
the company considered recent transactions and market trends involving similar aircraft in determining the fair market value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non operating expenses interest expense  net  increased million primarily due to the decrease in interest income earned from excess cash cash and cash equivalents decreased from million at december  to million at december  
the company has not recognized any benefit from the future use of operating loss carryforwards because management s evaluation of all the available evidence in assessing the realizability of the tax benefits of such loss carryforwards indicates that the underlying assumptions of future profitable operations contain risks that do not provide sufficient assurance to recognize such tax benefits currently 
the company s income tax benefit was and million in and respectively 
the benefit recorded in was the result of operating loss carryback claims 
compared to summary the company recorded a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

due to the eight month lapse of the excise tax during  the company s average fare in was compared to in operating expenses flight operations expenses were higher for the year ended december   than  due to an increase in asms  a substantial increase in the cost of hull insurance effective october  and the company s change in compensation structure in september the change in compensation structure reduced the percentage of compensation represented by bonuses and shifted the cost to base pay 
fuel increased due to a increase in consumption offset by a decrease in price from cents per gallon to cents per gallon 
maintenance expenses in were higher than primarily due to an increase in the number of operating aircraft from at december  to at december   which resulted in more check lines 
station operations expenses were higher  on a per asm basis  for the year ended december   than in  largely due to the suspension of operations and inefficiencies generated from restarting operations in many of the station facilities were not fully utilized during the fourth quarter of and during a portion of due to the limited operations 
of the stations operated by the company prior to its suspension of operations  were restarted during and eight during certain facility rental expenses related to non operating stations as a result of the suspension of operations are included in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
other factors contributing to a higher station operations expense were an increase in insurance costs as of october  and an approximate increase in labor rates 
certain station operations administrative costs were also incurred during the suspension of operations in with no asms being generated over which to spread these costs 
marketing and advertising expenses were higher in as a percentage of revenue  compared to this was due to the aggressive marketing campaign in the fourth quarter of to introduce the company s new business class product combined with a cost reduction effort in after the accident

depreciation on idled aircraft  as a result of the suspension of operations and reduced operations  was recorded in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
all of these aircraft were reactivated during during  the company made the decision to ground and dispose of certain idled aircraft 
subsequent to the decision to sell or lease out such aircraft  no depreciation was recorded on those aircraft held for sale 
during  as a result of the merger  the company s management decided to return these aircraft to service 
the aircraft were reclassified to flight equipment and will continue to be depreciated over their remaining useful lives 
shutdown and other non recurring expenses in and include costs associated with the loss of flight  excess operating costs related to the reduced schedule from may  to june   the suspension of operations from june  to september   and the reduced schedule from september  to december  such costs consisted of expenses directly related to the accident and the ensuing extensive faa review of the company s operations including legal fees  payments to the faa  related inspection costs and maintenance in excess of normal operating maintenance 
in addition  depreciation on grounded aircraft in and  rental of abandoned or idled facilities and costs of personnel idled as a result of the reduced and suspended operations from may through december are included in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses 
personnel costs include full wages  salaries and benefits that were provided to idled employees during the reduction and suspension of operations 
the decrease in shutdown and other nonrecurring expenses is primarily due to the resumption of operations in september and the related increasing service levels 
these costs consist of the following in thousands year ended december  maintenance   legal and other   depreciation   facilities rental  wages  salaries and benefits  excluding maintenance  faa remediation  no accrual was provided for costs to be incurred in future periods related to aircraft depreciation  maintenance and rental costs associated with temporarily idled facilities as such costs were recognized as they were incurred

at december   the company did not recognize any benefits from the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
the company s internal computer software and computerized operating systems were developed in conjunction with the commencement of the company s business in and were designed to take into consideration the year issue 
additionally  the company has implemented a year compliance program to ensure that the company s computer systems and applications will perform properly beyond in addition to the internal review  the company has received assurance from its significant computer system vendors that their applications are year compliant 
the company s business relies on government agencies and other third parties eg  department of transportation  federal aviation administration  airport authorities and data suppliers 
the ability of third parties upon which the company relies to adequately address their year issues is outside the company s control 
however  the company has begun a program to assess the year readiness of these parties 
based upon the results of this assessment  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary 
the company cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the impact on the company of the year problems that may be experienced by any of these parties 
however  the impact of any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
the company currently has a team dedicated to identifying  evaluating and resolving the company s potential year issues 
the company s year program includes five phases inventory  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the inventory phase will allow the company to evaluate current equipment conditions and readiness for the year transition 
in the next phase  assessment  the company will determine based on the information gathered during inventory  what  if any  upgrades enhancements are necessary to meet the compliance requirements 
remediation will provide a forum to develop solutions to non year compatible equipment  systems  or software 
the testing phase will provide a laboratory type environment for troubleshooting potential problems and situations once the year transition begins 
the testing phase will be the most critical in that all possible worst case scenarios must be addressed and procedures for handling these scenarios as they arise must be developed and tested 
once inventory  assessment  remediation and testing phases are complete  the company will implement the year program 
the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases of the year program or outside vendors and third parties are not year compliant by december   the most reasonable worst case scenario would be a reduction or suspension of operations  which could have a material impact on the company s business or consolidated financial statements 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company expects to have substantially completed all phases of its year program by june  which will leave six months for additional internal testing and troubleshooting prior to the company is approximately complete with the assessment relating to information technology it 
with respect to it systems that are known to have required remediation  approximately of such systems have been remediated  tested and implemented and are currently year compliant 
based on the results of the company s year program  the company will develop contingency plans as necessary 
costs associated with the year program excluding costs relating to capital improvements to it systems that are not directly related to re mediating year problems in such systems are being expensed as incurred 
funding for the program is being provided through the company s operating cash flows 
to date the company has spent approximately  in connection with the year program and expects to spend an additional  to complete the program 
the cost of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will be completed are based on management s best estimates and include assumptions regarding third party modification plans 
however  due primarily to the potential impact of third party modification plans  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
proposed legislation congress is currently reviewing three bills specifically related to air transportation and passenger rights 
several recent events surrounding airline passenger handling have prompted these proposals 
in brief  the three proposals  the airline passenger fairness act  the airline passenger bill of rights and the passenger entitlement and competition enhancement act  seek legislation to protect the traveling public 
the objectives of these acts are to provide consumers with a basic expectation of fair treatment from airlines  encourage better service by airlines and make airlines more responsible for their passengers  and ensure protection for passengers from anti competitive market concentrations in the airline industry 
to the extent legislation is enacted that would hinder airtran s flexibility with fares and customer service operations  airtran s financial results could be adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources the company relies primarily on its operating cash flow to provide working capital 
the company has no lines of credit or other facilities 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  and a working capital deficit of million compared to working capital of million at december  the company generally must satisfy all of its working capital expenditure requirements from cash provided by operating activities  from external capital sources or from the sale of assets 
substantial portions of the company s assets have been pledged to secure various issues of outstanding indebtedness of the company 
to the extent that the pledged assets are sold  the applicable financing agreements generally require the sale proceeds to be applied to repay the corresponding indebtedness 
to the extent that the company s access to capital is constrained  the company may not be able to make certain capital expenditures or to continue to implement certain other aspects of its strategic plan  and the company may therefore be unable to achieve the full benefits expected therefrom 
based on the favorable economic conditions of the us airline industry  the company expects to be able to generate positive working capital through its operations  however  since the airline industry is cyclical  we cannot predict whether the current favorable trends and conditions will continue 
for the year ended december   operating activities used million in cash flow 
investing activities used cash of million primarily related to the acquisition of hush kits and boeing advance purchase deposits 
financing activities used cash of million as a result of obtaining million in financing for the purchase of spare engines and million provided by the exercise of stock options  offset by million in scheduled long term debt payments 
as of december   the company s operating fleet consisted of mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft and boeing aircraft 
the company currently leases one dc aircraft to another carrier 
the company has contracted with boeing successor to mcdonnell douglas for the purchase of boeing aircraft  at a cost of approximately billion subject to adjustments for inflation  for delivery in to during the third quarter of  the company reached an agreement with boeing to defer the remaining progress payments until the first delivery which is expected in september there can be no assurance that cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet the progress payments for the boeing s beginning again after september if the company exercises its option to acquire up to an additional boeing aircraft  additional payments could be required beginning in the company expects to finance at least of the cost of each of these aircraft 
although boeing has agreed to provide support with respect to the financing of aircraft to be acquired  the company will be required to obtain the financing from other sources 
the company believes that with the support to be provided by boeing  aircraft related debt financing should be available when needed 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient financing on attractive terms 
if it is unable to secure acceptable financing  the company could be required to modify its aircraft acquisition plans or to incur higher than anticipated financing costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the company s compliance with stage noise requirements will require additional capital expenditures over the next year 
as of december   of the company s aircraft were stage compliant 
by december   full compliance is required 
the company intends to meet its stage noise requirement obligations by installing hush kits on stage aircraft  disposing of stage aircraft and by acquiring or leasing stage aircraft 
the company expects that faa certified hush kits will cost approximately million in total for all aircraft to be hushed in the company may be able to finance a portion of the cost of these hush kits and plans to make the balance of payments on these hush kits out of its working capital 
the company expects to pay the debt service on such loans out of cash flow generated from operations during the term of the financing 
as of december   the company s debt related to asset financing totaled million  with respect to which the company s aircraft and certain other equipment are pledged as security 
included in such amount is million of the company s senior secured notes due under which interest is payable semi annually 
in addition  the company has million of senior unsecured notes outstanding 
the principal balance of the senior notes is due in and interest is payable semi annually 
all of the company s debt has final maturities ranging from to with scheduled debt payments as follows million  million  million  million and million 
certain debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to per annum and is repayable in consecutive monthly or quarterly installments over a four to seven year period 
certain other notes with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately million as of december   have a variable rate of interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus to 
numerous lawsuits have also been filed against the company seeking damages attributable to the deaths of those on flight  and additional lawsuits are expected 
the company s insurance carrier has assumed defense of these lawsuits under a reservation of rights 
as all claims are handled independently by the company s insurance carrier  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of liability that might exist 
as a result  no accruals for losses or the related claim for recovery from the company s insurance carrier have been reflected in the company s financial statements 
the company maintains million of liability insurance per occurrence with a major group of independent insurers that provide facilities for all forms of aviation insurance for many major airlines 
the company believes  based on the information currently available to it  that such coverage is sufficient to cover claims associated with this accident and that the insurers have sufficient financial strength to pay claims 
however  there can be no assurance that the total amount of judgments and settlements will not exceed the amount of insurance available thereof or that all damages awarded will be covered by insurance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the company is subject to certain market risks including interest rates and commodity prices ie  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have an overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial policies and additional information 
interest rates as of december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be million  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december  aircraft fuel 
the company s results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel accounted for of the company s operating expenses excluding impairment loss in based on the company s projected fuel consumption  a one cent change in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel would impact the company s annual fuel expense by approximately million 
on march   the company entered into petroleum swap contracts and jet fuel purchase commitments in order to manage the price risk and utilization of fuel cost 
this fuel hedging strategy could result in the company not fully benefiting from certain fuel price declines 
as of march   the company has hedged approximately of its projected fuel requirements 
prior to march   the company had not entered into any hedging contracts
