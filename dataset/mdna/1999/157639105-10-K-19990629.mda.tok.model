each of these factors  and other risks pertaining to the company  the premium wine industry and general business and economic conditions  are more fully discussed herein and from time to time in other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
change in fiscal year end effective with the fiscal year ending march   the company changed its fiscal year from one ending on december to one ending on march accordingly  the company reported a three month transition period ending march  the company determined that the nature of its business cycle  with typically heavy sales activity towards the end of the calendar year  coupled with the fall harvest of its grapes  created difficulty in efficient and effective planning and budgeting on a calendar year basis 
a fiscal year ending march occurs at the end of what is historically the least active quarter with respect to sales activity and operations in the production of wine 
the company elected to file audited financial statements for the transition period referred to above 
in accordance with applicable regulations  this report includes consolidated balance sheets as of march  and march  and consolidated statements of income for the years ended march   and and december   respectively 
this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial information for the years ended march   and see item  selected financial data for a schedule of the data discussed herein 
results of operations the following table represents financial data as a percentage of net revenues for the indicated periods year ended march  year ended december  net revenues gross profit other revenues from operations selling  general and admin 
expenses operating income other income expense settlement income equity in net income of duhart milon minority interest net income loss wine sales net revenues for the year ended march  increased approximately over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase was attributable to a volume increase and a average price increase 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased by over the prior year comparable period 
this increase was attributable to a volume increase and an average price increase 
sales volume in the california market comprised of the company s total sales for the year ended march  although california is the company s largest market no single market outside of california accounted for more than of total sales in these years  management believes that increased unit sales in markets outside of california will continue to account for most of the company s future revenue growth 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended march  increased by approximately  or million  over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this was primarily the result of i increased sales volume  ii increased average sales prices  and iii less pronounced increases in average production costs partly due to the relative success and size of the harvest 
gross profit for the year ended march  was million  corresponding to a gross margin  as compared to million  or gross margin  in the year ended march  this increase in gross profit was mostly attributable to increased unit sales  price increases across all brands and a shift in the product mix of wines sold to higher margin wines 
other revenue from operations other revenue from operations consists of i revenue obtained from third party wineries  net of related expenses  for grape crushing or wine bottling and ii net profit from sales of bulk wine 
the company cannot predict the materiality of such operations with respect to future operating results  as this source of revenue is highly unpredictable and largely contingent on other wineries demand for extra production capacity  which can and does vary significantly from year to year 
the decrease of  from  to  for the twelve months ended march  from the comparable period in the prior year was attributable to less custom crush demand driven in part by the relatively lower harvest tonnage throughout california as compared to the harvest tonnage  partly offset by increased custom bottling demand 
the increase to  for the year ended march   from  in the prior period  was mostly due to the increased demand resulting from the unusually large harvest experienced in california 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended march  increased by over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase is primarily the result of i increased selling and marketing expenditures normally associated with increased sales quantities and also related to the launching of the new echelon brand name  ii expenditures in the company s infrastructure and iii unusually high severance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended march  increased by over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase was primarily the result of planned increases in marketing expenditures 
operating income operating income for the year ended march  increased by over the comparable period in the preceding year 
this increase was primarily due to gross profits  offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses as discussed above 
additionally  other revenues from operations decreased to of operating income for the year ended march   compared to in the prior comparable period 
operating income for the year ended march  increased over the prior comparable year 
this increase was mostly due to higher unit sales and gross margins per case  all discussed above 
other income expense  net the decrease of in net other expense between the years ending march  and was primarily driven by a decrease in net interest expense mostly due to lower interest rates 
interest expense for the year ended march  increased to million  an increase of from million in the prior comparable period 
this was primarily due to slightly higher borrowing levels 
settlement income as discussed at item a settlement of litigation arising from the carmenet fire  the company recognized in its march  consolidated statement of income  million relating to a settlement with pacific gas and electric pg e for the july fire damage at the carmenet vineyards 
equity in net income of duhart milon effective october   the company exchanged its ownership interest in dbr for a interest in societe civile chateau duhart milon 
the effect of this transaction was to convert an interest in dbr  accounted for using the cost method  into an interest in an active  operating vineyard and winery operation  accounted for using the equity method 
the company experienced record results during the twelve months ended march  from its investment in societe civile chateau duhart milon duhart milon 
the company s equity interest in the net income of duhart milon for the years ending march  and  were  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to exceptionally high demand for the vintage of bordeaux wines 
the vintage is expected to be one of the bordeaux region s most successful vintages in the past twenty years 
due to the exceptional nature of the vintage  this quarter s net income from the company s investment in duhart milon may not be indicative of future results 
the company monitors its investment in duhart milon primarily through its on going communication with domaines barons de rothschild dbr 
such communication is facilitated by the presence of the company s chairman on dbr s board of directors  and dbr s representation on the company s board of directors 
additionally  various key employees of the company make frequent visits to duhart milon s offices and productions facilities 
since the investment in duhart milon is a long term investment denominated in a foreign currency  the company maintains a reserve for currency translation which was  as of march  this reserve was reduced from  as of march  due to the increase in the relative worth of the french franc when compared to the us dollar during the twelve months ended march  although the transition to the euro currency became effective as of january   the company does not anticipate that this transition will have a material impact on its investment in duhart milon 
currency fluctuations are recorded in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in the equity section of the company s consolidated balance sheet  and in comprehensive income as defined by the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas reporting comprehensive income 
minority interest the edna valley vineyard evv and canoe ridge vineyard  llc crv financial statements are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
the interest in the equity and net income of evv and crv which belongs to parties other than the company is accounted for as minority interest 
the minority interest in the net income of evv and crv for the three years ended march  consisted of the following in thousands year ended march  minority venture minority owner percent edna valley vineyard paragon vineyard co  inc canoe ridge vineyard  llc various the minority interest in earnings for the year ended march  increased over the comparable period ended march   due to steadily improving performance at both evv and crv primarily as a result of increases in both case sales and gross margins per case 
the minority interest in earnings for evv for the year ended march  represents an increase of from the prior comparable period 
similarly  the minority interest for crv increased significantly 
both increases were due to improved performance at both evv and crv 
company management believes that evv and  to a lesser degree crv  will both continue to contribute significantly to the company s consolidated income statement 
net income net income for the year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or  over the year ended march  this was primarily as a result of non recurring settement income of million after tax effect and increased gross profits  offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses

seasonality the company s wine sales from quarter to quarter are highly variable due to  among other things  the timing of the release of wines for sale and changes in consumer demand 
sales are typically strongest during the fourth quarter because of heavy holiday sales and because most wines generally are released between the end of the third and beginning of the fourth quarters 
year the year issue yk is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to determine the applicable year 
as presently programmed  the company s computer programs and systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year unless reprogrammed  in the future this could result in miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  temporary inefficiencies in processing transactions  sending invoices  or engaging in similar normal business activities 
the company has an ongoing program designed to ensure that its operational and financial systems will not be adversely affected by yk software failures 
the company believes that its exposure to yk issues remains relatively minor in comparison to most industrial enterprises because of its relatively low reliance on computerized systems 
the company is doing everything technologically possible to assure its computers function properly upon the turn of the century 
compliance is to some extent dependent upon vendor cooperation 
preliminary estimates of the compliance related costs  based on internal projections  are approximately  the company recognizes that any yk system related compliance failures could result in additional expenses to the company  the materiality of which cannot be predicted at this time

disclosures about market risk you should read the following disclosures in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which have been drafted in compliance with recently adopted regulations of the sec concerning the use of plain english 
these disclosures are intended to discuss certain material risks of the company s business as they appear to management at this time 
however  this list is not exhaustive 
other risks may  and likely will  arise from time to time 
our revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our revenues will grow or be sustained in future periods or that we will maintain our current profitability in the future 
significant factors in these quarterly fluctuations  none of which are within our control  are changes in consumer demand for our wines  the affect of weather and other natural forces on growing conditions and  in turn  the quality and quantity of grapes produced by us  interest rates and other business and economic conditions 
additionally  our sales volume tends to be affected by price increases  distributors inventory levels and the timing of releases for certain wines  among other factors 
consequently  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
a large portion of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
in quarters when revenues do not meet our expectations  our level of fixed expenses tends to exacerbate the adverse effect on net income 
in quarters when our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
our profits depend largely on sales in certain states and on sales of certain varietals in the twelve months ended march   approximately of our wine sales were concentrated in states 
changes in national consumer spending or consumer spending in these states and other regions of the country could affect both the quantity and price level of wines that customers are willing to purchase 
approximately of our net revenues in the twelve months ended march  were concentrated in our top four selling varietal wines 
specifically  sales of chardonnay  pinot noir  cabernet sauvignon and merlot accounted for   and of our net revenues  respectively  for the twelve months ended march  competition may harm our business the premium table wine industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented 
our wines compete in all of the premium wine market segments with many other premium domestic and foreign wines  with imported wines coming primarily from the burgundy and bordeaux regions of france and  to a lesser extent  italy  chile  argentina  south africa and australia 
our wines also compete with popular priced generic wines and with other alcoholic and  to a lesser degree  non alcoholic beverages  for shelf space in retail stores and for marketing focus by our independent distributors  many of which carry extensive brand portfolios 
additionally  the wine industry has experienced significant consolidation 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and public relations resources than we do 
our sales may be harmed to the extent we are not able to compete successfully against such wine or alternative beverage producers 
our business is seasonal our business is subject to seasonal as well as quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
our sales volume tends to increase during the summer months and the holiday season and decrease after the holiday season 
as a result  our sales and earnings are typically highest during the fourth calendar quarter and lowest in the first calendar quarter 
seasonal factors also affect our level of borrowing 
for example  our borrowing levels typically peak during the winter when we have to pay for harvest costs and may have to make contractual payments to grape growers 
these and other factors may cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
bad weather  pests and plant diseases could harm our business winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
various diseases and pests and extreme weather conditions can materially and adversely affect the quality and quantity of grapes available to us 
this could reduce the quality or amount of wine we produce 
a deterioration in the quality of our wines could harm our brand name  and a decrease in our production could reduce our sales and profits 
future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs and or reduce production 
grape growing requires adequate water supplies 
we generally supply our vineyards water needs through wells and reservoirs located on our properties 
we believe that we have adequate water supplies to meet the needs of all of our vineyards 
however  a substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines 
many california vineyards  including vineyards in northern california  have been infested with phylloxera  a root louse that renders a vine economically unproductive within a few years after infestation 
the current strain of phylloxera primarily affects vines of a certain type 
our vineyard properties are primarily planted to rootstocks believed to be resistant to phylloxera 
however  we cannot be certain that our existing vineyards or the rootstocks we are now using in our planting and replanting programs will not in the future become susceptible to current or new strains of phylloxera  plant insects or diseases  any of which could harm our business 
the weather phenomenon commonly referred to as el nino produced heavy rains and cooler weather during the spring of  which resulted in colder and wetter soils than are typical during california s grape growing season 
consequently  the harvest was postponed by approximately four to six weeks depending on the geographical location and varietals 
the unusual weather conditions resulting from el nino impacted quantity and quality of the company s estate harvest 
the size of the company s most significant crops ranged from normal sized yields to of normal yields depending on the varietal and the particular estate 
despite the foregoing reduction in the yield of certain crops  the harvested estate crops  in combination with contracted grape purchases most of which are tonnage based  are expected to permit the company to meet originally anticipated sales projections for its vintage chardonnay  cabernet and merlot varietals which  together  have historically comprised between and of its aggregate annual production 
we may not be able to grow or acquire enough quality grapes for our wines the adequacy of our grape supply is influenced by consumer demand for wine in relation to industry wide production levels 
while we believe that we can secure sufficient supplies of grapes from a combination of our own production and from grape supply contracts with independent growers  we cannot be certain that grape supply shortages will not occur 
a shortage in the supply of wine grapes could result in an increase in the price of some or all grape varieties and a corresponding increase in our wine production costs 
industry trends point to rapid plantings of new vineyards and replanting of old vineyards to greater densities  with the expected result of significantly increasing the supply of premium wine grapes and the amount of wine which will be produced in the future 
this expected increase in grape production could result in an excess of supply over demand and force wineries to reduce  or not increase  prices 
we depend on third parties to sell our wine we sell our products primarily through independent distributors and brokers for resale to retail outlets  restaurants  hotels and private clubs across the united states and in some overseas markets 
to a lesser degree  we rely on direct sales from our wineries  our wine library and direct mail 
sales to our largest distributor and to our nineteen largest distributors combined  represented approximately and  respectively  of our net revenues during the twelve months ended march  sales to our nineteen largest distributors are expected to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the future 
we use a broker in order to sell our wines within california 
such sales represent of our net revenues during the twelve month period ended march  the laws and regulations of several states prohibit changes of distributors  except under certain limited circumstances  making it difficult to terminate a distributor without reasonable cause  as defined by applicable statutes 
the resulting difficulty or inability to replace distributors  poor performance of our major distributors or our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major distributors could harm our business 
new regulations or increased regulatory costs could harm our business the wine industry is subject to extensive regulation by the federal bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms and various foreign agencies  state liquor authorities and local authorities 
these regulations and laws dictate such matters as licensing requirements  trade and pricing practices  permitted distribution channels  permitted and required labeling  advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers 
any expansion of our existing facilities or development of new vineyards or wineries may be limited by present and future zoning ordinances  environmental restrictions and other legal requirements 
in addition  new regulations or requirements or increases in excise taxes  income taxes  property and sales taxes or international tariffs  could reduce our profits 
future legal or regulatory challenges to the industry  either individually or in the aggregate  could harm our business 
we will need more working capital to grow the premium wine industry is a capital intensive business which requires substantial capital expenditures to develop and acquire vineyards and to improve or expand wine production 
further  the farming of vineyards and acquisition of grapes and bulk wine require substantial amounts of working capital 
we project the need for significant capital spending and increased working capital requirements over the next several years  which must be financed by cash from operations or additional borrowings or other financing 
adverse public opinion about alcohol may harm our business a number of research studies suggest that various health benefits may result from the moderate consumption of alcohol  but other studies suggest that alcohol consumption does not have any health benefits and may in fact increase the risk of stroke  cancer and other illnesses 
if an unfavorable report on alcohol consumption gains general support  it could harm the wine industry and our business 
we use pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of our business we use pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of our business 
if hazardous substances are discovered on  or emanate from  any of our properties  and their release presents a threat of harm to public health or the environment  we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation 
payment of such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks  and others  under various insurance policies 
however  our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us 
contamination of our wines would harm our business we also are subject to certain hazards and liability risks  such as potential contamination  through tampering or otherwise  of ingredients or products 
contamination of any of our wines could result in the need for a product recall which could significantly damage our reputation for product quality  which we believe is one of our principle competitive advantages 
we maintain insurance against these kinds of risks  and others  under various general liability and product liability insurance policies 
however  our insurance may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at a price or on terms that are satisfactory to us 
the loss of key employees would damage our reputation and business our success depends to some degree upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
although some key employees are under employment contracts with us for specific terms  the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees could harm our business and our reputation  particularly if one or more of our key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company 
in such an event  despite provisions in our employment contracts which are designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets  practices or procedures by such personnel under these circumstances  we cannot be certain that we would be able to enforce these provisions or prevent such disclosures 
shifts in foreign exchange rates or the imposition of adverse trade regulations could harm our business we conduct some of our import and export activity for wine  packaging supplies and various wine production needs in foreign currencies 
we purchase foreign currency on the spot market on an as needed basis and engage in limited financial hedging activities to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
there is a risk that a shift in certain foreign exchange rates or the imposition of unforeseen and adverse trade regulations could adversely impact the costs of these items and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in addition  the imposition of unforeseen and adverse trade regulations could have an adverse effect on our imported wine operations 
we do not believe that our foreign exchange risk and international operations exposure is material at this time  but the volume of international transactions is increasing and may increase these risks in the future 
infringement of our trademarks may damage our brand names or our business our wines are branded consumer products  and we distinguish our wines from our competitors by strong and vigilant enforcement of our trademarks 
there can be no assurance that competitors will refrain from using trademarks  tradenames or trade dress which dilute our intellectual property rights  and any such actions may require us to become involved in litigation to protect these rights 
litigation of this nature can be very expensive and tends to divert management s time and attention 
our acquisition of staton hills winery and potential future acquisitions involve a number of risks our acquisition of staton hills winery and potential future acquisitions involves risks which include assimilating staton hills into our company  integrating  retaining and motivating key staton hills personnel  integrating and managing geographically dispersed operations because staton hills is in washington state and our company is headquartered in california  integrating the technology and infrastructures of the two companies  risks inherent in the production of wine in  and marketing of wine from  washington state  and the risks to our company of the increased negative cash flow and increased operating expenses arising from the acquisition of  and plans for  staton hills 
the integration of the operations  technology and personnel of our company and staton hills is expected to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
staton hills and chalone must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communications systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays  including potential incompatibility of our business cultures  perceived adverse changes in our business plans  potential conflicts in our supplier and customer relationships and the loss of key employees and diversion of the attention of management from other ongoing business initiatives 
the market price of our common stock fluctuates all of the foregoing risks  among others not known or mentioned in this report  may have a significant effect on the market price of our shares 
stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility in recent months and years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the specific company s operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may reduce the market price of our shares
