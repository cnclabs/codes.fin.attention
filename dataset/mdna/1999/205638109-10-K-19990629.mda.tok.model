year the year problem is the result of the widespread practice of using only two digits instead of four to represent the year in computing equipment and computer software 
failure to address this problem could cause erroneous results in the proper interpretation of years after the company has instituted various projects to address this issue which include three major areas the software products which the company develops and markets  its internal information technology it assets and aspects not directly related to the company s it assets or software products non it assets 
this last area includes such items as embedded systems in infrastructure components such as building security and hvac systems  as well as the business relationships the company has with its customers and suppliers  especially those third parties with whom the company has a systems interaction 
the company undertook a project to inventory and assess the impact of the year on its software products in the middle of as a part of this project the company identified the software products that would be supported beyond december  plans were put in place to complete the necessary changes to make the identified software products year compliant 
the company believes that all of the company s current product offerings as well as those products the company will continue to support are year compliant 
the company has established a web page to update customers on the year status of the software products 
this site assists the customers in understanding the year strategy 
part of the site gives customers access to frequently asked year questions 
the company is committed to supporting its customers into the year and beyond 
the strategy provides leadership and tools needed to meet the challenge of the millennium change 
the company has undertaken a project to inventory  assess and remediate its significant internal software applications and other it assets 
many of these applications are essential for day to day operations 
the company believes it has completed remediation  testing and implementation for all critical software 
the remediation and testing activities have been performed exclusively by internal resources 
the company is also in the process of assessing and remediating its other it and non it assets 
these include areas such as pcs  networks  voice mail  e mail  building security  etc 
this portion of the project is planned for completion by october   and appears to be on schedule 
the company has also undertaken a project to identify and assess its significant third party suppliers  and is developing a plan to address vendor or supplier year issues through remediation  repair  replacement or upgrade so as to avoid any business disruption 
in most cases  the company is forced to rely on third party representations  without any ability to do independent testing or evaluation 
contingency plans are being developed for certain key third parties which are deemed to be critical for the company s operation 
based upon the information received to date  the company does not expect any material financial impacts from third party vendors 
embedded systems and other non it systems are being evaluated for year compliance  and being repaired or replaced as necessary 
the costs for year related activities are being budgeted as necessary 
costs of the company s year compliance activities have not been and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
this expectation assumes that the company will not be obligated to incur significant year related costs on behalf of its customers or suppliers  and that the company s critical vendors will be able to meet their commitments to the company 
the company will be adequately prepared to meet the challenges of the coming of year without significant impact to the company s ability to carry on its normal business operations 
management estimates that it is approximately complete with all remediation efforts  which includes completion of all critical business systems and supported software products 
the balance of the efforts yet to be expended are in the areas of non it assets  monitoring supplier compliance and contingency planning 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited to its cash investments 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of the company s investment strategy 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and preserves its invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  the company has classified all its marketable debt securities and long term debt investments as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statement of income or balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates 
information about the company s investment portfolio is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk the company has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company has not entered into forward foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the company s designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since the company enters into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
the company operates in certain countries in latin america  and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
at march   the company had contracts maturing through may to sell  in foreign currencies  with a fair value of  information about the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements
