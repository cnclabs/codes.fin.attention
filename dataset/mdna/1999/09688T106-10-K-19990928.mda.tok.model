impact of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenue and results of operations 
based on the current economic climate  the company does not expect that inflation and changing prices will have a material impact on the company s revenue or earnings during fiscal many of the costs of operating the resorts can be fixed for certain periods of time  reducing the short term effects of changes in the rate of inflation 
room rates  which are set on a daily basis  can be rapidly changed to meet changes in inflation rates as well as other changing market conditions 
the company has less flexibility in changing group rates since guest reservations are typically made up to one year in advance of the stay 
to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be adversely affected
