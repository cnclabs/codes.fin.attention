 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  during the year ended january  see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
year the company recognizes that without appropriate modification  some computer programs may not operate properly when asked to recognize the year upon reaching the year  these computer programs will inaccurately interpret the used in two digit date calculations as the year in anticipation of the need to correct and otherwise prepare for any potential year computer problems  the company formed a year task force the task force which has developed a year compliance plan the plan 
the plan addresses the company s state of readiness  the costs to address the company s year issues  the risks of the company s year issues and the company s contingency plans 
the company s state of readiness internal systems the company s plan addresses all of the company s hardware and software systems  as well as equipment controlled by microprocessors used in the offices  stores  and distribution centers 
as a part of the plan  the task force has completed its assessment of the company s systems  has identified the company s hardware  software and equipment that will not operate properly in the year and in most cases  has remedied the problem with programming changes 
the plan has identified the company s accounting  inventory management and warehouse management systems as critical systems 
the company expects the programming changes and software replacement for systems that are not already year compliant will be completed during the first and second quarters of the company has completed testing the year readiness of many of its systems and expects to complete the testing process by july the company s year compliance effort has not resulted in any material delays to other internal information technology projects 
external systems the company has requested  and is receiving  written confirmation from vendors  suppliers and other service providers third party vendors as to their year system compliance status 
although the company is diligently seeking and is receiving information as to its third party vendors year compliance progress  there can be no assurance that such third party vendors will have remedied their year issues 
although the company currently knows of no material third party vendor system that will not be year ready  the failure of any significant third party vendor to remedy its year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  financial position or liquidity 
the company will continue to aggressively monitor the progress of its third party vendors in an effort to mitigate its own year non compliance risk 
the costs to address the company s year issues based on the company s current estimates  the cost of addressing the company s year remediation efforts will be between  and  to date  expenditures have been less than  costs are being expensed when incurred 
this cost estimate excludes the costs of previously planned software implementations as well as salaries of existing employees involved in the year remediation efforts 
these projected costs are based upon management s best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
however  there can be no guarantee that these costs estimates will be accurate  actual results could differ materially 
the risks of the company s year issues management believes that its greatest risk to achieving timely year compliance is in its third party relationships 
for example  if a significant vendor experiences shipping delays because either its systems or a third party vendor s systems are not year compliant  such delays could have a material impact on the company s business depending on the nature of the shipment and the length of the shipping delay 
however  currently available information indicates that the company s significant third party vendors will be year ready 
management also believes there is a moderate level of risk associated with the unconfirmed year compliance status of small utility companies that provide utility service to the company s individual stores 
the company s contingency plans the company will continue to closely monitor the year compliance readiness of its third party vendors and  where appropriate  will replace those third party vendors who appear to be unwilling to confirm their year readiness or who are unable to meet compliance deadlines 
the company has been developing  and intends to complete by july  a comprehensive business continuity plan bcp that is designed to respond to significant business interruption 
the bcp focuses on business recovery and continuation made necessary by natural disaster  year system non compliance  vendor breach of contract or any other factor 
although it is impossible to accurately predict and prepare for all risks associated with the year issue  the company will continue to evaluate and modify where appropriate its bcp to address those risks which it believes are reasonably foreseeable
