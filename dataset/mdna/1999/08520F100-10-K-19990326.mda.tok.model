see special note regarding forward looking statements 
general overview the company s operations are conducted primarily through the following business segments language instruction  translation services  and publishing 
the company s sales grew from million in to million in  a compound annual growth rate of 
its earnings per share both basic and diluted  before extraordinary items  dropped from to in the same three year period  favorably impacted by higher operating profits  but hurt by additional interest expense associated with the financing of the company s august acquisition of els educational services  inc  and by net foreign exchange losses 
the following table shows the company s income and expense data as a percentage of sales year ended december  sales of services and products costs of services and products sold selling  general and administrative amortization of publishing rights excess of cost over net assets acquired  and other intangibles interest expense on long term debt interest expense to affiliate other income  net total costs and expenses income before income taxes  minority interest in earnings of subsidiary  and extraordinary item income tax expense minority interest income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt  net of tax benefit net loss income consists primarily of teachers  translators  and certain administrative salaries  as well as cost of materials  rent  maintenance  depreciation and other center operating expenses 
consists primarily of administrative salaries  marketing and advertising expenses  and other headquarters related expenses 
the company s recent growth is attributable to a number of factors  including the purchase of a significant new subsidiary 
on august  the closing date  the company completed its acquisition of els educational services  inc els  a privately held provider of intensive english language instruction  in a stock acquisition for a cash purchase price of million the els acquisition  subject to certain post closing adjustments specified in the related stock purchase agreement 
such post closing adjustments aggregated million and were paid to the sellers in january the company also incurred various transaction related expenditures 
financing for the transaction  and simultaneous refinancing of the company s existing senior notes  term loan  and related prepayment penalties and costs  was provided through a bank loan facility the bank facility consisting of term loans and a revolving credit facility aggregating million at the closing date 
els contributed million and million  respectively  in post acquisition revenues for the years ended december  and the company s operations have also benefited in recent years from a number of global trends which have increased the demand for the company s services 
for example  the opening of central and eastern europe to capitalism and the economic growth experienced in latin america have contributed to increased international business activity and the use of english worldwide as a business language 
another example is the market for software localization and technical translations services  an area in which the company s translations segment is a global leader 
this market has increased rapidly as software programs have proliferated and have been translated into numerous language versions  and as the company s customers have increasingly outsourced the software localization process 
internal actions have also helped the company grow 
for example  in language instruction  the company continued to expand several niche programs  including cross cultural services  berlitz jr r  berlitz on campus r and berlitz study abroad r  enabling it to operate even more effectively as a one stop language service provider 
to complement its live instruction  the company has increasingly used technology  such as cd rom  video and audio tools  to enhance its traditional teaching programs while reducing teaching costs 
the company has also increased its emphasis on more profitable semi private and group lessons  and has increased the number of company owned language center locations  adding new berlitz language centers and deleting over the three year period ended december  to further increase its market presence  the company has utilized franchising and joint ventures in emerging and secondary markets 
from commencement of its operations through december   the company s franchising business segment has granted berlitz franchises  of which have opened as of december in the translations segment  there has been a continued focus on large corporate accounts  development of new customers  superior customer satisfaction  and the expansion of services  including a continuing commitment to the information technology industry  software localization  and software testing services 
as translations services grows  the company will seek to continue improving the profitability of the segment through i the deployment of latest telecommunication technology  including the use of the internet  to optimize internal operational efficiency and provide real time customer information  ii increasing productivity through the use of more advanced computer aided translation tools  iii continuing to centralize certain non linguistic functions  such as software engineering  software quality assurance and desktop publishing  and iv hiring  training and retaining the highest quality industry talent available in the industry 
the publishing segment s recent performance has been disappointing  having been hurt in and by a number of factors 
these included significant transition problems related to the move of editorial and production functions from the united kingdom to the united states  the absence of new products and out of stock situations for certain products  a challenging competitive environment  and limitations of inventory management systems 
however  certain positive events beginning toward the end of have set the stage for a turnaround 
for example  a new publishing organization structure has been established with new executive and senior management 
an integrated inventory control and accounting system is now in place and new analytical tools are being developed 
having articulated a new business plan to customers and partners in all key markets  results show strong growth in traditional markets 
geographically  the majority of the company s subsidiaries are located outside the united states  with operations conducted in their respective local currencies 
for the three years ended december   the percentage of total revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars averaged  in foreign currencies including the japanese yen  german mark  irish punt  brazilian real  mexican peso  british pound and french and swiss francs 
as a result  changes in exchange rates affected the comparisons of the company s earnings from period to period  adversely affecting s  s  and s financial results when the dollar generally strengthened

furthermore  in the north america division  approximately of els berlitz on campus annual enrollments for the year ended december  originated from the far east 
due to this geographic presence in asia  the company is exposed to the economic turmoil affecting the asian region  and management therefore continues to focus on action steps designed to mitigate any future impact 
these include implementing cost control measures  maximizing economies of scale  and intensifying emphasis on revenues generation from the company s other geographic divisions

the company plans to meet its debt service requirements and future working capital needs through funds generated from operations 
the year issue introduction the year issue is the result of certain computerized systems use of a two rather than four digit year  eg  vs 
as a result of the ambiguous century in such systems  the introduction of twenty first century dates may cause systems to function abnormally or not at all 
recognizing the need to ensure operations will not be adversely affected by year failures  the company established a committee to address any possible exposure 
this committee is responsible for carrying out the company s awareness program  assessing key financial and operational systems  for assessing external relationships with customers and vendors  and for developing and implementing detailed divisional action plans 
the company has divided the year issue into three areas i infrastructure  ii internal use financial and operational software  and iii key third party customer and vendor relationships 
for each area  the committee is responsible for carrying out the following steps inventory  assessment  remediation and testing  and contingency plan development and implementation 
the infrastructure area contains all hardware  embedded systems  and software  excepting financial and operational software 
non compliant internal use financial software is currently being replaced in conjunction with the global deployment of peoplesoft systems 
such peoplesoft systems are warranted to be year compliant and have been successfully tested as such 
key third party relationships include external interfaces between the company and its suppliers  service providers  and customers that are deemed material to the continued operation of the company 
state of readiness overall  the company s year project is currently proceeding on schedule and is expected to be fully completed according to the original schedule by september  as of april  the committee had completed a worldwide systems inventory and assessment for the infrastructure and internal use financial and operational systems areas 
to minimize complicating factors  the company chose to replace rather than upgrade most non compliant systems without commercially available remediation paths at the time of assessment 
the company is employing both internal and external resources in its remediation efforts 
remediation and testing of systems began in july and is scheduled to continue through september  testing is scheduled to occur in line with remediation efforts  as systems are upgraded or replaced  compliance testing of the system will begin 
based on current progress  the company reasonably expects that all internal remediation efforts in this area will be completed on or before the scheduled completion date 
further  the company believes it is unlikely that its efforts to remediate non compliant financial and operational software would extend beyond the scheduled completion date 
the company has conducted a formal communications program with all key vendors and customers to identify and assess their states of readiness 
based on the results of this process  the committee is assessing the likelihood of a failure in a third party s own year remediation program and the resulting impact to the company 
communications with key third parties are continuing to minimize the exposure to the company and its ability to conduct normal business 
the company completed its initial assessment of external vendor relationships in november due to the fact that many third parties programs are not yet fully completed  the company expects communications to continue through september third parties that do not provide convincing evidence that they will successfully achieve compliance by september will be subject to replacement 
risk the company expects to achieve internal compliance and does not believe that any reasonably likely risk of failure exists 
based on management estimates and the uncertainty surrounding the company s ability to guarantee the compliance of third parties  the company expects that the most likely worst case is that some third parties fail to successfully and completely remediate all year issues 
third party failures could range from the loss of a utility or service such as electricity or telecommunications to a loss of revenue due to a customer s inability to conduct normal business based on the failure of the customer s or vendor s own systems or those of its own critical third party relationships 
third parties deemed material to the company fall primarily into the following categories banks  accounting bureaus  telecommunications providers  utilities  and customers 
although management estimates that it is reasonably likely that some third parties may experience failures  the company does not believe that the aggregate effect of such failures will have a material effect on the company s consolidated future results 
this estimate is based on the nature of the company s services  its widespread geographic dispersion  and the diversity of its customer base 
although third party failures are beyond the reasonable control of the company  the company is making every effort to reduce any negative effect by closely communicating with third parties to follow the progress of their remediation programs and minimize the risks associated with a third party s failure to achieve compliance 
contingency plans to further minimize any risk associated with any internal or third party failure to achieve compliance  the company is currently in the process of developing contingency plans for those critical systems and third party relationships that have the potential to materially interrupt the company s ability to conduct normal business 
decisions regarding the implementation of specific contingency plans are expected to be made by the end of the first quarter of and  if deemed necessary  are expected to be fully implemented by the end of the third quarter of costs to address the year issue the company currently estimates the cost for year compliance with respect to its information and production systems to be approximately million  consisting of million for replacements of financial accounting and operational systems with the remainder dedicated to infrastructure and third party relationship remediation

the accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would depend on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
sfas will be effective for the calendar year beginning january on september   the securities and exchange commission sec issued a press release stating that it will formulate and augment new and existing accounting rules and interpretations covering revenue recognition  restructuring reserves  materiality and disclosure for all publicly traded companies

however  the potential changes in accounting practice being considered by the sec staff could have a material impact on the manner in which the company recognizes revenue
