statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including the timely development and acceptance of new products  the impact of competitive products and pricing  changing market conditions and the other risks detailed in the company s prospectus and from time to time in other filings 
actual results may differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements represent the company s judgment as of the date of this document 
the company disclaims  however  any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
readiness of year until recently  many computer programs were written using two digits as a space saving measure rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth century 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company is in the process of defining  assessing and converting  or replacing various internal computer programs and systems to ensure that these information technologies will be year yk compliant 
implementation is expected to be completed before september  at which time the company expects to have completed its plans to test yk compliance of critical systems 
while the estimated yk costs of these efforts are not expected to be material to the company s financial position or any year s results of operations  there can be no assurance to this effect 
non information technology systems  which include embedded technology such as micro controllers used in fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  and other common devices may also be affected by the yk problem 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect  if any  and the cost of remediating the yk problem with respect to its office and facilities equipment 
while the company continues to test its products  it believes these products  which do not utilize date codes  are yk compliant 
however  the fact that these products interact with other third party vendor products and operate on computer systems which are not under the company s control  it is not possible to be completely certain that all of the yk problems have been foreseen 
in addition  the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers to determine that the supplier s operations and the products and services they provide are yk compliant 
where practicable the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of suppliers to be yk ready 
a survey of the company s major suppliers has revealed that have yk compliance programs in place and are  or will be  yk compliant in a timely manner 
in the event that these third parties are not yk compliant  the company will seek alternative sources of supplies 
however  such failures remain a possibility and could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
recovery under existing insurance policies should be available depending upon the circumstances of a yk related event and the type of facility involved 
generally  no recovery would be available in the event of an orderly shutdown which does not result in damage to a facility 
potential recoveries in the event of facility damage  including business interruption  would be subject to deductibles in place under these policies 
the above expectations are subject to uncertainties 
for example  if we are unsuccessful in identifying or fixing all yk problems in our critical operations  or if we are affected by the inability of suppliers or major customers to continue operations due to such a problem  our results of operations could be materially impacted
