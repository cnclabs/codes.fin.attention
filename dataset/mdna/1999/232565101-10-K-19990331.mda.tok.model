year compliance year compliance refers generally to the problems that some software  including firmware embedded in cylink s products  may have in determining the correct century for the year 
for example  software with date sensitive functions that is not year compliant may not be able to distinguish whether means or  which may result in failures or the creation of erroneous results 
cylink has defined year compliant as the ability to i correctly handle date information needed for the december  to january  date change  ii function according to the product documentation provided for this date change  without changes in operation resulting from the advent of a new century  assuming correct configuration  iii where appropriate  respond to two digit date input in a way that resolves the ambiguity as to century in a disclosed  defined  and predetermined manner  such as in certificate based products  or in accordance with cylink s year compliant test plan  and iv recognize year as a leap year 
cylink has developed a year readiness plan for the current versions of its products 
cylink has largely completed all phases of its plan  except for contingency planning  with respect to the current versions of all of its products 
as a result  the current versions of each of its products currently offered for sale are year compliant 
in some cases  cylink s products require an upgrade provided by cylink which is either sold as a complete substitute or as a kit sold with the product in order to be year compliant 
cylink has initiated a review of its mission critical internal information systems including the third party software for its management information systems  networks and desktop applications  and its hardware telecommunications technology 
cylink expects to complete that review by mid when deficiencies are identified in critical components  cylink is purchasing new or upgraded versions which have been certified by their vendors as compliant 
cylink has funded its year plan from operating cash 
while cylink does not expect such costs to be material  cylink will incur additional amounts related to the year plan for administrative personnel to manage cylink s readiness plans  technical support for its product engineering and customer satisfaction 
cylink has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if cylink is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations 
the cost of developing and implementing such a plan may itself be material 
despite testing by cylink and current and potential customers  and any assurances from developers of products incorporated into cylink s products or in use in cylink s business operations  cylink s products may contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions 
further  cylink may be using products in its business operations which are not year compliant 
an unanticipated year interruption could have material adverse financial consequences to the company or seriously impair business operations for an indefinite period of time 
for a more comprehensive discussion of cylink s year plans and exposures  see the year topic under part i  item  risk factors that may affect future results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company held a total of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
these securities consist primarily of money market funds and high grade  short term corporate obligations 
certain of these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels as of december   the decline in fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
the company transacts substantially all of its revenues and costs in us dollars and its results of operations would not be materially affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
accordingly  to date  the company has not used material amounts of derivative financial instruments 
as of december   the company had no fixed rate obligations except for capitalized leases and long term debt of approximately 
as such  the fair value of the company s fixed rate obligations is not subject to a material adverse impact from changes in interest rates
