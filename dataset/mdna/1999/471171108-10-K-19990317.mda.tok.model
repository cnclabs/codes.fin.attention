liquidity and capital resources during  the company satisfied the capital requirements of its operations with internally generated funds and approximately million of net proceeds received from the sale of the power generation businesses 
in addition  the net proceeds from the sale of the power generation businesses enabled the company to pay off its revolving loan with its banks and end the year with million of cash on its balance sheet 
subsequent to year end  the company used this cash to finance new acquisitions and to pay down additional debt 
for the foreseeable future  the company believes it will generate funds from operations to meet the capital requirements of its existing operations 
also  subsequent to year end  the company completed a new million bank loan agreement which reflects the requirements of both its domestic and international operations 
as of december   the company had no borrowings against its bank facility and letters of credit outstanding of  during  the company also satisfied the capital requirements of its operations with internally generated funds

no significant commitments are outstanding as of december seasonality us auto makers traditionally shut down for the annual model changeover in the third quarter 
in addition  adjustments to production schedules are made throughout the year based on retail auto sales and the level of dealer inventories 
these seasonal patterns affect the company s motor vehicle products operations most significantly but also have somewhat of an impact on industrial products due to the effect on automotive suppliers which use the company s precision components and finishing products 
year issues the company s state of readiness the company s main financial and manufacturing hardware and software systems have been tested and are now believed to be year compliant 
this was accomplished primarily through systems upgrades and maintenance performed over the last few years to enhance functionality of the systems  not solely to achieve year compliance 
the only systems that remain to be upgraded for year are certain ancillary  mostly pc based  interface systems used for shop floor control and report writing functions 
year compliance for these systems is ongoing and is expected to be completed by mid major customers and suppliers have been surveyed and to date the company has not been made aware of significant year issues that would materially affect its business 
costs to address the company s year issues the majority of the company s year issues were corrected either through systems upgrades required for other business purposes or normal maintenance contracts 
therefore  these improvements have not resulted in costs significantly incremental to non year planned information systems activities 
the estimated costs to correct the remaining ancillary systems still not compliant are not expected to exceed  risks to the company for year issues with regard to systems under the company s control  management does not believe that the company has significant exposure to the year issue since  if necessary  systems are capable of accepting manually entered data 
the believed worst case scenario is that the company would have to revert back to certain manual systems for a small portion of its systems  for example  shop floor labor collection and certain internal reporting functions 
our customers and vendors are at various stages of compliance  but management is not aware of significant year issues that would materially affect the company s business with them 
the company will continue to monitor year compliance with its customers and vendors throughout  but will be unable to achieve the same degree of certainty that it has achieved with internal systems 
the company s contingency plans by the middle of  the company expects to be fully year compliant 
to the extent that it has minor internal systems that are not year compliant by mid year  the company will have time to implement manual systems by year end which management believes will significantly reduce the financial risk to the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to interest rates is managed by fixing interest rates on the majority of the company s long term debt 
fluctuation in commodity prices  for example steel and cotton cloth  are managed by strategic purchasing which generally provides the time necessary to allow for price increases to customers  where appropriate 
in rare situations where commitments are made for extended periods more than days  outside of functional currencies  for example  a commitment to purchase european equipment for use in a us plant which will take six months to deliver  exposure is managed by entering into hedging transactions authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities 
hedging transactions involve the use of derivative financial instruments and are used only where there is an underlying exposure  not for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   there were no outstanding hedging transaction 
foreign operations the company has significant foreign operations  for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in german marks and british pounds and to a lesser extent  canadian dollars  swedish kronor  french francs  mexican pesos  brazilian reals  chinese renminbi and portuguese escudos 
as the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company has operations increases or decreases relative to the us dollar  the sales  expenses  profits  assets and liabilities of the company s foreign operations  as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements  increase or decrease  accordingly 
the company s primary method of reducing this exposure is to approximately balance current assets and liabilities within each functional currency 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge this exposure 
because the company has significant operations across member countries of the european monetary union  the introduction of the euro on january  is expected to simplify the management of foreign exchange exposure by aggregating the assets and liabilities of several currencies that now have to be managed individually 
euro conversion on january   member countries of the european monetary union emu began a three year transition from their national currencies to a new common currency  the euro 
in the first phase  the permanent rates of exchange between the members national currency and the euro has been established and monetary  capital  foreign exchange  and interbank markets will be converted to the euro 
national currencies will continue to exist as legal tender and may continue to be used in commercial transactions 
by january  euro currency will be issued and by july  the respective national currencies will be withdrawn 
the company has operations in member countries of the emu and  accordingly  has established action plans that are continuing to be implemented to address the euro s impact on information systems  currency exchange rate risk  taxation  contracts  competition and pricing 
based on its current assessment  management believes that the costs of the euro conversion will not have a material impact on the operations  cash flows or financial condition of the company

such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  changes in capital expenditure requirements  the ability of the company and its suppliers and customers to address year issues and general economic conditions in the company s market segments
