operating results fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal revenues increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in revenues was due to a increase in revenues from the company s power and process instrumentation products partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the company s motion control products 
the decrease in motion control revenues was primarily due to decreased orders as a result of the asian economic crises and the slowdown in the semi conductor industry partially offset by the addition of revenues from emoteq uk 
motion control orders  however  increased over the prior year  with the order rate progressively increasing over the last three quarters of fiscal at june  backlog for motion control orders was higher than at june  this is a reflection of motion control s expansion into new markets and broader segments of its existing markets 
the increased order rate and backlog indicate that the segment should achieve growth in sales and profitability in fiscal year sales to international customers decreased from  or of sales  in fiscal  to  or of sales  in fiscal sales order backlog increased from  at june  to  at june  cost of products sold remained at of revenues in fiscal and selling expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal resulting from savings due to the overall cost reduction efforts of the company as well as from hia s change in its primary focus to the deregulated power industry in from industrial markets in previous periods 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to bonuses paid to the management of profitable operations and the addition of emoteq uk 
engineering and development expenses increased from  in to  in amortization of intangibles and other assets decreased from  in to  in the decrease was primarily due to the  impairment write off in fiscal of the unamortized portion of goodwill which resulted from the hia acquisition  partially offset by the  impairment write off in fiscal of the unamortized portion of goodwill from the acquisition of hathaway systems limited hsl  and fiscal amortization expense related to the ashurst acquisition 
see further discussion under business acquisition below 
as a result of its acquisition of hsl  the company had previously recorded goodwill of  at june  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 the company determined that the unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired from its acquisition of hsl was impaired  and  therefore  wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of  the company s determination was based on projections of undiscounted cash flows of hsl  which were based on current marketplace conditions  low orders and continuing losses 
such undiscounted cash flow estimates were not sufficient to indicate realization of the related unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired 
utilizing such projections and discounting the estimated cash flows  the company determined that the entire unamortized amount was impaired 
the current year amortization of  and impairment write off of  totaling  is included in amortization of intangibles and other in the fiscal year consolidated statement of operations

the company accounts for the chinese joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
at the time of the original investments in the chinese joint ventures and until fiscal  the company determined that due to the start up nature of the entities  their untested products and political uncertainty in china  the realization of the initial investments and subsequent earnings which were not significant was uncertain  and  therefore  the company fully reserved against the original investments and its share of any equity in income 
during fiscal years and  kehui and si fang s operations continued to mature  their products have gained significant acceptance and both companies have sustained profitability 
because of sustained positive operating results  offset by a certain amount of political and business uncertainty in china  the company recognized a portion of its share of equity income from these two joint ventures  totaling  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
these amounts are included in equity income from investments in joint ventures in the consolidated statements of operations 
the amounts recognized represent management s best estimate of the future amounts that will be received from the joint ventures as of june  the company will continue to recognize its share of equity in income loss from these two joint ventures to the extent it believes such amounts are realizable

during fiscal year  the jv was dissolved and settled its existing obligations from its existing assets 
the license to manufacture  market and sell the tis system reverted back to the company and the company has no further obligations related to this jv 
in fiscal year the company recognized a provision for income taxes of  compared to a benefit of  in fiscal year the effective tax rate was a provision of in fiscal and a benefit of in fiscal the difference is primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible expenses and goodwill amortization plus an increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
the increase is also due to income taxes payable in local tax jurisdictions where the company has no net operating losses 
the valuation allowance was increased primarily due to the increased level of net operating losses being carried forward and the company s continued operating losses 
realization of the company s net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the company generating sufficient united states federal taxable income approximately  in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s management believes that  on a more likely than not basis  the recorded net deferred tax asset is realizable 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future united states federal taxable income are changed 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  in the fiscal and results include  and  of net losses from hathaway industrial automation hia which was acquired by the company effective september  see discussion under business acquisition below  and is included in the company s power and process business

at june   and in accordance with sfas no 
 the company determined that the unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired from its acquisition of tis was impaired  and  therefore  wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of  the company s determination was based on projections of undiscounted cash flows of hia  which were based on current marketplace and competitive conditions and resulting low margins for the industrial applications of hia s products 
such undiscounted cash flow estimates were not sufficient to indicate realization of the related unamortized cost in excess of net assets acquired 
utilizing such projections and discounting the estimated cash flows  the company determined that the entire unamortized amount was impaired 
the fiscal year amortization of  and impairment write off of  is included in amortization of intangibles and other in the fiscal year consolidated statement of operations

business acquisitions ashurst logistic electronics limited effective july   emoteq corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired all the outstanding shares of ashurst logistic electronics limited of bournemouth  england ashurst for  in cash 
ashurst manufactures drive electronics and position controllers for a variety of motor technologies as well as a family of static frequency converters for military and aerospace applications and has extensive experience in power electronics design and software development required for the application of specialized drive electronics technology 
the acquired company was renamed emoteq uk limited 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
tate integrated systems  inc effective september   the company acquired a partnership interest in tate integrated systems  lp and of the stock of the sole general partner  tate integrated systems  inc collectively referred to as tis 
the ownership interests were acquired for an adjusted negotiated price of  of which  was paid in cash at closing on october    on june  and  when certain accounts receivable of tis were collected during fiscal tis has operated under the ownership of hathaway industrial automation hia  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the company  since october  hia is located in hunt valley  maryland and is a full service supplier of process automation systems for industrial applications 
hia has developed a state of the art software system for supervisory control and data acquisition scada and distributed control systems dcs 
the hia system has been used to fully automate such industrial applications as water and wastewater treatment plants  glass manufacturing plants  oil and gas terminals and tank farm facilities 
in addition to expanding into its traditional process markets  hia s system is being marketed to the degregulated power utility industry 
the company is selling the hia system together with certain other hathaway products and targeting the combined product at substation automation and integration applications used in the generation  distribution and transmission of power 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
for the years ended june  and and the nine month post acquisition period ended june   hia had losses before income taxes of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
hia s traditional business is highly dependent on sales to the industrial market which typically encompasses a long sales cycle  significant customization to specific customer requirements  long performance periods and large contract values which are subject to a high degree of scrutiny and negotiation with customers 
consistent with the company s strategy to develop applications for the hia software for the deregulated power industry  the company has continued to invest substantial resources in hia 
as evidenced by hia s profitable fourth quarter in fiscal year  the company is beginning to successfully market hia s products to the deregulated power industry 
hia s fourth quarter profitability was partially due to its completion of certification testing of one of its automation systems with the california independent system operator corporation california iso 
certification allows the company s system to be installed at generator sites throughout california 
the company s system is currently the only certified system available to california generators 
each system will sell for  to  per site  depending on the size and technical requirements of each site 
there are approximately power generators located at approximately generation plants that supply electricity to consumers in the state of california 
the automation system developed for california iso will enable california iso to measure and control the amount of electricity being put into the transmission system by generators to ensure reliable delivery of power to meet the demands of the consumers in california 
a major feature of the system is its ability to use digital certificate and encryption technology to ensure data privacy and control security 
also during the second half of fiscal  hia was awarded a million contract to supply a control and automation system for the treatment plant which supplies all potable water to the las vegas region 
management believes that the software products developed by hia  as modified for the power industry and combined with other company products  will provide power companies with automated and integrated systems solutions that will both reduce their operating costs and improve the reliability of their power supply 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications will be successful and or economically viable 
management believes that there is significant demand in the power industry for such solutions as a result of the business environment created by the recent industry deregulation 
the successful implementation of the company s current business plan continues to be partially dependent on the company s ability to successfully market hia s products to the deregulated power industry 
the factors that will affect the success of implementing this business plan include  but are not limited to  the ability to win sufficient amount of project work on favorable terms to the company  the ability to complete projects in a timely and cost effective manner  and the existence of sufficient demand for the hia products 
an inability to achieve this plan in the planned timeframe may have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity position as measured by cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash decreased  during the year to a balance of  at june  fiscal operating activities used  compared to  generated in fiscal and  used in the amounts used to fund the operations of the hia business in  and was   and  respectively  while the amounts generated from the operating activities of the company s other businesses was   and  respectively  for the same periods 
the increased cash generated from operations during was primarily due to income tax refunds received 
cash of   and  was used by investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
the cash used for investing activities includes  net of cash acquired  paid for the purchase of emoteq uk limited and  net cash received from investments in joint ventures 
the and cash used for investing activities includes  and  respectively  paid for the interest acquired in tis 
financing activities generated  in fiscal year  and used  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increased cash used in financing activities in was due to repayments  net of borrowings  on the line of credit of  at june   the company had  of debt  compared with  at june   an increase of  the debt at june  represents borrowings on the company s current long term financing agreement agreement with silicon 
the agreement matures on may  and  accordingly  the  balance has been classified as a current liability as of june  the agreement is subject to automatic and continuous annual renewal for successive additional terms of one year each unless either party notifies the other of its intention to terminate the agreement at least sixty days before the next maturity date 
borrowings on the loan are restricted to the lesser of  or of the company s eligible receivables maximum credit limit 
as of june   the company could borrow an additional  up to the maximum credit limit of  the loan bears interest at silicon s prime borrowing rate prime rate plus at june  
the interest rate is adjustable on a quarterly basis to prime rate plus if the company achieves a net loss less than  for each previous twelve month rolling period 
the company must continue to meet this quarterly financial goal  or the rate will be re adjusted to prime rate plus 
in addition to interest  the loan bears a monthly unused line fee at of the maximum credit limit less the average daily balance of the outstanding loan during a month 
the unused line fee is also adjustable on a quarterly basis  if the company achieves a net loss less than  for each previous twelve month rolling period  the monthly unused line fee will be adjusted to 
the company must continue to meet this quarterly financial goal  or the rate will be re adjusted to 
the debt is secured by all assets of the company 
the agreement requires that the company maintain compliance with certain covenants related to tangible net worth 
at june   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
as in the three year period ended june   the company s fiscal working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements are expected to be funded from the existing cash balance of  and the  available under the long term financing agreement at june  the company believes that such amounts are sufficient to fund operations and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
as explained above  the company s agreement with silicon matures on may  but will continue for successive additional terms of one each year unless either party gives notice of termination at least sixty days before the maturity date 
the company has not received notice of termination and does not anticipate receiving or giving such notice  however  if such notice was received  the company would pursue other lenders to meet its long term financing needs 
although the company believes it would be successful in its efforts to obtain alternate financing  there are no assurances that it will be successful in doing so 
an inability to obtain such alternate financing may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company continues to explore all possible opportunities for increasing shareholder value including a possible spinoff of the power and process business as well as other alternatives 
year compliance some computers and computer based systems use only the last two digits to identify a year in the date field and cannot distinguish the year from the year the company recognizes that the year poses a challenge to the proper functioning of computer systems included in its products  software systems used in its business and items purchased from its suppliers 
the company has adopted a yk readiness program and is taking what it believes to be appropriate steps necessary in preparation for year issues 
the company is completing an assessment of its products to determine which products will be affected by year issues 
test procedures have been modeled from the public document titled year test procedures  published by general motors corporation  and include a step by step method of date verification using each interface to the product 
testing of most products is completed or under way 
modifications and updates are being made as needed for products that are not yk compliant 
with the possible exception of some of the older rtu protocol software  testing of all of the company s current products will be complete before december  some of the company s older products that are no longer sold will not be tested for compliance 
the company will indicate on its web site which products will not be tested 
the company has completed its assessment of its internal systems  processes and facilities for year compliance and found them to be compliant 
the expected completion date to have all significant internal systems  processes and facilities compliant is october  the company s assessment of its suppliers  service providers and contractors year compliance is also ongoing and is expected to be completed by october  alternative sources will be pursued for any non compliant sources 
additionally  alternative sources will be identified and qualified for all compliant sources so that a secondary supplier will be available in the event that disruption in supply occurs from the primary supplier 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  normal business activities or operations 
there is inherent uncertainty regarding the year problem primarily due to the uncertainty of the readiness of suppliers and customers 
therefore  the company is unable to predict with certainty whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s year efforts are expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and the company currently believes it will be able to modify or offer alternative products as well as modify or replace its affected systems in time to minimize any detrimental effects on customer relationships or operations 
activities related to year compliance are being performed with internal resources 
the company is expensing as incurred all payroll and associated costs related to the year issue 
it is not anticipated that year activities will delay other projects or materially impact the company s business 
however  the company will continue to review on an ongoing basis whether it needs to further address any anticipated costs  problems and uncertainties associated with year consequences 
price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of june   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based on the prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at june   approximately million was outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of prime plus 
the line of credit matures in may and is subject to automatic and continuous annual renewal for successive annual terms of one year each unless either party notifies the other of its intention to terminate the agreement at least sixty days before the next maturity date 
the company manages interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents bearing variable interest rates which are tied to various market indices 
additionally  the company monitors interest rates frequently and has sufficient cash balances to pay off the line of credit and any early termination penalties  should interest rates increase significantly 
as a result  the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
foreign currency risk the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in northern ireland and england 
sales from these operations are typically denominated in british pounds  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the british us exchange rate may positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company does not believe that reasonably possible near term changes in exchange rates will result in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company  and therefore  has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the british pound
