item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of orders which are difficult to forecast 
because our customers generally order on an as needed basis  and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  we don t have an order backlog which can assist us in forecasting results 
for all these reasons  our results of operations for any quarter are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter 
a large portion of our quarterly revenue is usually generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter do not meet our forecast  operating results can be very negatively affected 
we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
see note of notes to financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other expense net loss comparison of fiscal years ended march net revenue 
our net revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and to  in fiscal  representing an increase of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due mostly to the increased sales of dvd creator systems  offset partially by the decline in sonic medianet a discontinued network product and sonicstudio sales 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales of dvd creator systems 
international sales accounted for  and of our net revenue for the   and fiscal years  respectively 
see note of notes to financial statements 
our international sales increased proportionally in fiscal primarily due to increased sales of dvd creator outside the united states  depending on the rollout of the dvd video format in certain non us markets 
our international sales decreased proportionally in fiscal primarily due to the increased sales of dvd creator systems in the us markets 
international sales have historically represented around of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue increased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal the increase for fiscal year was primarily due to approximately  of additional charges  based upon our decisions to write down inventory and capitalized software related to discontinued and slower selling product lines 
the decrease in cost of revenue in fiscal year is due to an absence of charges like those recorded in fiscal  plus a shift in sales product mix towards dvd creator system sales as well as the efficiencies inherent in a higher overall level of sales 
marketing and sales 
our marketing and sales expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal marketing and sales represented  and of net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
our marketing and sales headcount decreased from thirty four at march  to twenty eight at march  and increased to thirty seven at march  our marketing and sales expenses increased primarily due to increases in advertising and marketing costs related to our dvd creator product line as well as increased sales commission expense 
in fiscal marketing and sales expense decreased because our commission expenses decreased 
this was due primarily due to a shift in sales into dealer channels we generally do not pay commissions to dealers for sales of our products  instead the dealers compensation is derived from the markup they apply to our products 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal our research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
our research and development expenses increased in fiscal due to increases in consulting and prototype expenses associated with introductions of new products in our dvd creator product line 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal due to decreases in consulting and prototype expenses associated with new product introductions 
prototype and consulting expenses can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the status of hardware and software development projects and our schedule of new product introductions 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and to  in fiscal these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and of net revenue in fiscal our general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal and fiscal due to reductions in bad debt and other general expenses 
our general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal and fiscal because the absolute level of such expenses was lower  and they were being compared to an increasing level of net revenue 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as costs increase and if our operations expand 
other expense  net 
the other expense item on our statement of operations includes primarily the net amount of interest or other financing charges we have incurred due to borrowings reduced by the interest we earn on cash balances and short term investments 
for our  and fiscal years  we incurred interest and other financing charges related to financing agreements we had with entities associated with hambrecht quist  as well as borrowings under our bank credit line 
provision for income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we made no provision for income taxes for our   and fiscal years 
under applicable taxation and accounting rules companies which incur losses are entitled under many conditions to receive tax refunds  and therefore can record a tax benefit 
we did record such a tax benefit during the fiscal year 
however  during the fiscal year we exhausted our ability to carryback tax losses 
thus we recorded no tax benefit during the  and fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources 
in december  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
this agreement  which we sometimes refer to as our bank credit line  has been modified or renewed at various times since december the current bank credit line provides for up to  in available borrowings based upon our eligible accounts receivable balances 
the current bank credit line will expire on july  we are currently negotiating a new bank credit line with silicon valley bank to continue until mid we expect our new bank credit line will include terms that are quite similar to our current bank credit line this bank credit line provides for a variety of covenants  including among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios 
the bank credit line is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
interest on borrowings under this agreement is payable monthly at a rate between three quarters percent and two and one half percent in excess of the prime rate prime rate at march  was 
on march   was outstanding under this agreement 
the company was in compliance with its debt covenants under this agreement at march  in december   we also obtained a  financing facility with entities associated with hambrecht quist 
this facility included subordinated debt as well as equipment lease financing 
we received  of subordinated debt from hambrecht quist transition capital  llc and  of subordinated debt from hambrecht quist guaranty finance  llc pursuant to the above facility 
the remaining  of the facility was used to fund a master lease line for financing of future capital asset purchases 
the facility with the hambrecht quist entities is secured by an interest in our fixed assets and substantially all of our other assets but is subordinate to our bank credit line 
in connection with this financing facility we issued warrants to purchase  common shares to entities associated with hambrecht quist 
the hambrecht quist entities were entitled to exercise the warrants with respect to  shares at an exercise price of at any time on or before december   and with respect to  shares at an exercise price of at any time on or after december  and before december  in december   all of the warrants were exercised on a net basis  and the warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
we recorded  of deferred interest attributable to the value of the warrants  which was amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the term of the financing facility 
the value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions volatility of  risk free interest rate of and expected life equal to the contractual terms 
in march   we renegotiated our financing arrangement with hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
the agreement we reached involved the restructuring of  debt into  of convertible preferred stock and  of debt 
the interest rate on such restructured debt is and is due in october we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the  shares of our common stock which underlie the series c convertible preferred stock issued to hambrecht quist guaranty finance 
in connection with the agreement  the exercise price of  of the warrants issued in connection with the original arrangement reached in december was changed to 
we accounted for this transaction by revaluing the new warrant  using comparable assumptions as the original warrant grant and the resultant value of  is being amortized to interest expense over the new loan period 
in june    of the warrants were exercised on a net exercise basis  and warrant holder received  shares of common stock 
during the fiscal year  shares of the preferred stock were converted into common stock 
in december   we secured a  equity based line of credit by entering into a stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge 
under this arrangement  we had the right to draw up to a total of  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued was based on the market price of sonic solutions common stock at the time of a draw subject to a discount and a commission payable in common stock 
the availability of the credit line  and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to a number of conditions 
in january   we filed a form s registration statement under the securities act of to register the resale of shares issued under this credit line 
during the quarter and fiscal year ended march   we drew  from this credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock to kingsbridge and  shares to trinity capital advisors 
during the fiscal year ended march   we drew an additional  from this credit line for which we issued  shares of common stock 
because of certain limitations on the total number of shares which can be issued under this line of credit  this facility is currently unavailable to us 
on may   we secured a new equity based line of credit by entering into a new stock purchase agreement with kingsbridge 
under the new arrangement  we may draw up to  in cash in exchange for common stock 
pricing of the common stock issued under this arrangement is based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw  subject to a to discount and a commission 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s to register for resale the shares we may issue to kingsbridge under this credit line 
our use of this new line is subject to a number of conditions  including the effectiveness of the registration statement 
more details concerning the terms and conditions governing this arrangement are available in the registration statement 
we anticipate that the registration statement will become effective and that the new credit line will become available to us in the third calendar quarter of however  there can be no assurance that the registration statement will become effective or that other conditions governing the use of the new line will be satisfied 
thus there can be no assurance that any proceeds will become available to us under the new line at any time in the future 
our operating activities have used cash of  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal during those fiscal years cash required by operating activities was not as great as our operating losses due to various factors  including improvements in receivables collection and inventory turnover  and the receipt of income tax refunds in certain fiscal years 
in addition to our operating losses  we utilized cash during the   and fiscal years to purchase new fixed assets  and to develop and purchase software that was added to capitalized software 
during fiscal year we augmented cash on hand with the proceeds of the subordinated debt facility with entities associated with hambrecht quist noted above 
during fiscal we augmented cash on hand via borrowings from our bank credit line described above  as well as draws on the equity credit line described above 
during the fiscal year we augmented cash on hand primarily by drawing on the equity credit line described above 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available credit and cash generated from operations  plus cash available through the new equity based line of credit with kingsbridge when and if it becomes available see discussion above will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal year as of march   sonic solutions had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to represent the applicable year in a date 
any of our computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year or some other year rather than the year this could potentially result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in other similar normal business activities 
we are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our own computer or data dependent systems 
these include our systems in information  business  finance  operations  manufacturing and customer service 
any failure or malfunctioning on the part of these or other systems could adversely affect our business in ways that are not currently known  discernable  quantifiable or otherwise anticipated by us 
we have ensured that our internal software and embedded technology is already year compliant 
thus  we do not expect this issue to have a material effect on our operations 
we also believe that all current versions of our products are year compliant 
we currently have only limited information on year compliance of our key suppliers and customers 
we have received confirmation from a primary supplier that it is year compliant 
we are currently surveying our key suppliers and customers for year compliance and will be developing our own contingency plan in case of suppliers failures 
we anticipate that these surveys and the development of our contingency plan should be completed by september  the operations of our key suppliers and customers could be adversely affected by the year problem  which could cause significant problems in our business 
a survey of our leased properties and facilities  including vendors providing power  local and long distance telecommunications  water  heating and cooling  and various services to determine the status of embedded technology equipment that could affect our operations  will be conducted within the next few months 
temporary disruption of our manufacturing  customer service  sales and marketing  research and development and administrative functions may occur as a result of vendors non compliance affecting the delivery of power  telecommunications  water and heating and cooling services 
we believe we are taking the steps necessary to understand the year issues  however  failure to adequately address all known and unknown year compliance issues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financing condition and results of operations 
the remaining year compliance activities are not expected to result in significant incremental operating expenses 
to date  we have not incurred significant incremental costs to become year compliant
