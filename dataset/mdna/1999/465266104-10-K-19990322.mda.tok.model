fluor daniel over offices in broad based gti  inc north america  environmental services europe and firm australia on february   we signed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of roche limited consulting group roche for an initial payment of million in cash  plus two potential earnout payments 
roche is based in quebec city  canada and provides engineering and construction services to wastewater  paper  mining and transportation industries worldwide 
roche has approximately employees and had revenue of million in its most recent year ended december  the acquisition is expected to close in april on march   we signed an agreement to acquire specified assets of the environment and facilities management group efm group of icf kaiser international  inc kaiser for a purchase price of million reduced by million representing working capital retained by kaiser 
we also agreed to assume specified liabilities 
the efm group provides environmental remediation  program management and technical support for united states government agencies including the dod  national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the doe as well as private sector environmental clients 
the efm group has approximately employees and had revenue of million for the calendar year ended december  the acquisition is expected to close in april change in fiscal year in june  we changed our fiscal year end from the last friday in march to the last friday in december of each year effective with the nine months ended december  accordingly  the following discussion compares financial results for a nine month period to a full twelve month year 
likewise  the financial results for the nine month period ended december  include ohm s results for the entire nine month period while the financial results for the twelve month period ended march  include only one month of ohm financial results because we acquired of ohm on february  in addition  our operating results will be discussed based on the business platforms we established when we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no

nine months ended december  compared to twelve months ended march  revenues and gross margin company 
revenues for the nine months ended december  were million  an increase of approximately  when compared to the million in revenues reported in the twelve months ended march  this increase is primarily attributable to higher revenues in the engineering construction platform resulting from the ohm acquisition 
our gross margin for the nine months ended december  was  slightly higher than the gross margin reported in the twelve months ended march  in the fiscal year  management expects to maintain these gross margin levels 
however  our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin levels is heavily dependent on various factors including utilization of professional staff  proper execution of projects  successful bidding of new contracts at adequate margin levels and continued realization of overhead savings achieved upon the completed integration of recent acquisitions 
engineering construction 
revenues from the engineering construction platform were million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended march   an increase of approximately 
our engineering construction platform includes revenues from the department of defense dod  department of energy doe and commercial clients 
revenues from the dod and a small number of other government agencies were million in the nine months ended december  or million greater than the million of dod revenues in the twelve months ended march  doe revenues of million in the nine months ended december  were million higher than the million of doe revenues reported in the twelve months ended march  commercial revenues were million in the nine months ended december  or million higher than the million of commercial revenues reported in the twelve months ended march  a substantial percentage of our revenues continue to be earned from federal governmental contracts with various federal agencies 
revenues from federal governmental contracts accounted for of our revenues in the nine months ended december  compared to in the twelve months ended march  the increase in government revenues for the nine months ended december  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to the ohm acquisition 
federal governmental revenues are derived principally from work performed for the dod and  to a lesser extent  the doe and are thus included in our engineering construction platform 
we expect to continue to earn a substantial portion of our engineering construction revenues from the dod indefinite delivery order contracts which are primarily related to remedial action work 
in addition  management expects to increase our revenues from the doe in the future due to an expected transition by the doe over the next several years to emphasize remediation  as opposed to studies  combined with our favorable experience in winning and executing similar work for the dod and our past performance of doe studies 
we believe that we have begun to benefit from this transition by the doe with the commencement in of a million project to perform the excavation  pretreatment and drying of an estimated one million tons of materials for the doe s fernald environmental management project 
the increase in commercial revenues for the nine months ended december  is primarily attributable to the ohm acquisition 
however  revenue growth from the commercial sector  excluding recent acquisitions  could be restricted in the near term partly due to increased emphasis on competitive bids and commercial clients delaying certain work until final congressional action is taken on the reauthorization of cercla 
as for cercla  it is uncertain when reauthorization will occur or what the details of the legislation  including retroactive liability  cleanup standards  and remedy selection  may include 
uncertainty regarding possible rollbacks of environmental regulation and or reduced enforcement could further decrease the demand for our services  as clients anticipate and adjust to the new regulations 
these factors have been partially offset by an increased desire on the part of commercial clients for strategic environmental services that provide an integrated  proactive approach to environmental issues and that are driven by economic  as opposed to legal or regulatory  concerns 
further  legislative or regulatory changes could also result in increased demand for our services if such changes decrease the cost of remediation projects or result in more funds being spent for actual remediation 
the ultimate impact of any such changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the us economy and clients views on the cost effectiveness of the remedies available 
our engineering construction platform segment profit was million for the nine months ended december   an increase of when compared to the million segment profit for the twelve months ended march  this increase is primarily attributable to the ohm acquisition 
the engineering construction segment profit was of engineering construction revenues for both the nine months ended december  and for the twelve months ended march  consulting ventures 
revenues from our consulting ventures c v platform were million for the nine months ended december  compared to million reported during the twelve months ended march   a decrease of approximately 
most of the revenues from consulting ventures are derived from commercial clients 
the increase in these revenues on an annualized basis is primarily due to four acquisitions of specialized companies during the twelve months ended march  as well as the gti acquisition during the nine months ended december  for a description of our recent acquisitions  see acquisitions 
excluding any future acquisitions  revenue growth from the commercial sector could be restricted as discussed above under engineering construction 
our consulting ventures platform segment profit was million for the nine months ended december   an increase of when compared to the million segment profit reported in the twelve months ended march  the consulting ventures segment profit was and of consulting ventures revenues for the nine months ended december  and the twelve months ended march   respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of jsc and gti 
outsourced services 
outsourced services revenues were million for the nine months ended december  compared to million reported in the twelve months ended march  this increased revenue is almost entirely attributable to the ohm acquisition and the inclusion of its outsourcing operations in our results of operations for the nine months ended december   as opposed to the one month of results included in the twelve months ended march  ohm s outsourcing operations provide a range of project  program and construction management services to the dod as well as state and local government agencies 
our outsourced services platform segment profit improved to million for the nine months ended december   an increase of million when compared to the million segment profit reported in the twelve months ended march  this increase is also a result of the ohm acquisition 
international 
international revenues  primarily from our investment in chi mei it  a subsidiary operating in taiwan  were million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended march  the increase  on an annualized basis  is the result of chi mei increased project volume and the gti acquisition on december  see business operations international for a more detailed description of the international platform 
our international platform reported a loss of million for the nine months ended december  compared to a loss of million in the twelve months ended march  this improvement is primarily due to improved project margins on several chi mei projects 
through the chi mei board of directors  we undertook to improve management oversight  project management skills and change order negotiation efforts 
we believe these efforts will minimize future potential losses and provide the basis for profitable chi mei operations 
the gti acquisition increased the size of the international platform with operations primarily in australia  the united kingdom and italy 
the gti acquisition included approximately million of contract backlog for work to be performed for the us air force center for environmental excellence under a worldwide five year indefinite delivery order cost reimbursable contract 
we expect to increase the platform further with the acquisition of roche in see notes to consolidated financial statements subsequent events 
backlog 
our total funded and unfunded backlog at both december  and march  was approximately billion 
at december   the backlog included approximately million of funded contracted backlog scheduled to be completed during and approximately million of unfunded project work expected to be defined and performed in under existing indefinite delivery order contracts 
we expect to earn revenues from our backlog primarily over the next one to five years  with a substantial portion of the backlog consisting of governmental contracts  many of which are subject to annual funding and definition of project scope 
the backlog at both december  and march  includes billion of future work we estimate we will receive based on historical experience under existing indefinite delivery order programs 
in accordance with industry practices  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation  delay or modification by the customer 
our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in scope of services which may lead to increases or decreases in backlog amounts 
these scope changes have led to a number of contract claims requiring negotiations with clients in the ordinary course of business

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for the nine months ended december  compared to of revenues in the twelve months ended march  this decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of certain duplicative overhead functions and other cost savings achieved as a result of the ohm acquisition 
in fiscal  management expects selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues because the full effect of the cost savings from the ohm acquisition will be realized 
in addition  we anticipate additional cost savings to be achieved from the gti acquisition that occurred on december  selling  general and administrative expenses include goodwill amortization expense of million for the nine months ended december  and million for the twelve months ended march  the significant increase to goodwill amortization is primarily due to the ohm acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses excluding goodwill were of revenues for the nine months ended december  and of revenues for the twelve months ended march  special charges we recorded special charges of million for the nine months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended march  for the nine months ended december  we recorded a non cash charge of million  including million net of cash proceeds of million related to the sale of our investment in quanterra  incorporated and million  related to the write down of assets associated with the htts r business

in early january  the joint venture paid million to the government to resolve related civil claims by the government 
our share of the joint venture results is  accordingly  we received net cash of million  our proportionate share of the settlement 
in december  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million because the cash received was less than the receivables related to this project which totaled approximately million 
relocation of corporate headquarters and sale of remediation business 
the special charges that occurred in the first quarter of the twelve months ended march  resulted from the relocation of our corporate headquarters from torrance  california to monroeville pittsburgh  pennsylvania and the sale of our california based small project remediation services business 
the headquarters relocation consolidated the corporate overhead functions with our largest operations office and moved us closer to our lenders and largest shareholders  which are located in the eastern united states

our ratio of total debt  including current portion  to equity was at december   at march  and at march  see notes to consolidated financial statements long term debt 
due to conditions existent in the long term credit markets during the third and fourth quarter of  we utilized our revolving credit facility and current cash flow as described above to finance the acquisition of gti 
as a result of the utilization of funds for acquisition purposes and a million increase in unbilled receivables related to certain government projects which  according to the contract terms can not be billed until certain milestones are achieved  we have utilized a larger portion of our existing revolving credit capacity than would normally be expected 
between the date of the gti acquisition and mid march  we have had average daily availability under our revolving credit facilities and cash of million 
we continue to have significant cash requirements including interest  operating lease payments  preferred dividend obligations  required term loan and subordinated debenture principal payments  the potential acquisition contingent payments discussed above  expenditures for the closure of our inactive disposal sites and prp matters see transportation  treatment and disposal discontinued operations and contingent liabilities 
the efm and roche acquisitions require an aggregate cost which excluding potential earnout payments we estimate to be approximately million 
to finance the acquisitions and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  and with improving conditions in the capital markets  we have begun a private placement of million of senior subordinated notes notes 
if the offering is completed  the notes will have a fixed rate of interest payable every six months in cash commencing in and will be redeemable on or after the notes will be general unsecured obligations  subordinated to borrowings under our credit facilities and other senior indebtedness and pari passu with other existing future indebtedness unless the terms of that indebtedness expressly provide otherwise 
as of december   on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the note offering and the efm and roche acquisitions  the aggregate amount of debt including the current portion would have been approximately million  and approximately million would have been available for additional working and acquisition capital under the revolving credit facilities 
our obligation to close the efm acquisition is subject to the successful completion of the note offering and if the acquisition does not close on or before may   either party can terminate the agreement and we will forfeit million in payments we will have made under the agreement by that time 
our obligations to close the roche acquisition are not subject to any financing contingencies  however  we have agreed with roche s shareholders to purchase certain shareholders interests for approximately million by march  and to postpone the purchase of the remaining interests until completion of the note offering 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of our exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in the circumstances and in light of information currently available to us 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
at december   we had fixed rate debt totaling million in principal amount and having a fair value of million 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would decrease to approximately million if interest rates were to increase by from their levels at december  at december   we had floating rate long term debt totaling million in principal amount and having a fair value of million 
these borrowings are under our bank credit facilities see notes to consolidated financial statements long term debt 
we have entered into a swap agreement with a notional amount of million as required by our credit facilities and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates relating to this debt 
we have not entered into any other derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
if floating rates were to increase by from december  levels  we would incur additional interest expense of approximately million 
as discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements discontinued operations  our consolidated balance sheet includes million of accrued liabilities to complete the closure and post closure of our disposal facilities and other matters  net of certain trust fund and annuity investments which are restricted to closure and post closure use and insurance recovery 
these trust fund assets total million at december  and consist predominately of high quality common stocks  fixed rate aaa rated corporate and government bonds  and annuity investments which provide for periodic payments into the trust fund 
if interest rates were to increase by from their levels at december   the decrease in fair value of the fixed rate debt securities would not be material to us 
if the market prices of the individual equity securities were to decrease by from their levels at december   the resulting loss in fair value of these securities would not be material to us 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness our core financial and administrative software systems are certified as year compliant by the vendor 
during the twelve months ended march   we established an integration test plan to test this software and verify year compliance 
in february  we completed the integration tests which verified that the company s core financial and administrative software systems were year compliant 
our core hardware was also tested and was found to be fully compliant with the year requirements 
we recently hired a year program director and have begun communicating with clients  suppliers  financial institutions and others with which we do business to coordinate year conversion 
a significant portion of our business is attributable to the us federal government see business operations clients 
if the us federal government is not year compliant  there could be a delay in the collection of accounts receivable from the us federal government in january at this time  we cannot predict the impact on our consolidated financial condition  liquidity and results of operations of the us federal government s year readiness 
however  we do not believe there will be any significant delays in the collection of our accounts receivable 
costs we have prepared a detailed conversion plan and have estimated the total cost of year compliance to be approximately million 
as of december   we have incurred costs of approximately million to address year issues 
all of the costs have been or will be charged to operating expense and funded through operating cash flows 
risks and contingencies we are currently developing a contingency plan to address how we will handle the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios including situations where our clients  suppliers  financial institutions and others are not year compliant on january  we do not have control over these third parties and  as a result  cannot currently estimate to what extent future operating results may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to successfully address their year issues 
however  our contingency plan will include actions designed to identify and minimize any third party exposures and management believes that  based on third party exposures identified to date  these issues should be resolved by the year forward looking statements statements of our intentions  beliefs  expectations or predictions for the future  denoted by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  project  imply  intend  foresee  and similar expressions are forward looking statements that reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include those identified in the business section of this report and the following 
changes in laws or regulations affecting our operations  as well as competitive factors and pricing pressures  
bidding opportunities and success  
project results  including success in pursuing claims and change orders  
management of our cash resources  particularly in light of our substantial leverage  
funding of backlog  
matters affecting contracting and engineering businesses generally  such as the seasonality of work and the impact of weather and clients timing of projects  
our ability to generate a sufficient level of future earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets  
the ultimate closure costs of our discontinued operations  
the success of our acquisition strategy  including the effects of the integration of recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions  including the proposed acquisitions of efm and roche described in this report  and achievement of expected cost savings and other synergies therefrom  and 
industry wide market factors and other general economic and business conditions 
our actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of these factors  many of which are beyond our control
