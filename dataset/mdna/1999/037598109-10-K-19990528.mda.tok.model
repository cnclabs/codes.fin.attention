item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in fiscal  apogee continued its focus on company wide efforts to improve margins  productivity  working capital usage and capital allocation 
the two most significant outcomes of these initiatives in fiscal were the substantial capacity expansion of the company s glass technologies operations and the divestitures of two of apogee s business units detention security systems contracting and domestic curtainwall 
combined with apogee s prior year decision to exit its international curtainwall operations  the sale of its detention security and domestic curtainwall businesses effectively removes the company from large scale construction activities 
accordingly  the detention security and curtainwall contracting businesses are reported as discontinued operations 
in connection therewith  apogee modified its business segment structure  with the company now operating as two segments glass technologies and glass services 
a more detailed description of our results and financial position is provided in this financial review 
performance fiscal compared to fiscal the following table illustrates the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended february  percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest and other expense  net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and other items income taxes equity in net loss of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations net earnings loss consolidated net sales increased to million in fiscal the glass services gs segment reported a net sales gain of  while the glass technologies gt segment s net sales were essentially unchanged with those of a year ago 
net sales of gs s replacement auto glass businesses increased  while net sales of its building glass services unit grew by more than one third 
the replacement auto glass operations increased net sales by combining retail same store net sales growth with the addition of retail and wholesale locations 
gt net sales were flat primarily due to the effects of capacity limitations and the relocation of a product line 
on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  rose slightly to  up from in fiscal the primary factors underlying the resulting decline in gross profit were the effect of the planned suspension and relocation of a gt product line  temporary productivity issues related to capacity limitations at viracon and a small decline in margin in the replacement auto glass businesses 
these factors were partly offset by margin improvements at gs s harmon  inc and gt s architectural products units 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million  or  but declined slightly as a percent of net sales 
the primary factors for the growth were higher salaries  outside services and charitable contributions  as well as increased information systems and marketing costs  particularly at our gs segment 
net interest expense rose to million in fiscal the increase reflected higher interest rates and borrowing levels under our revolving credit agreement 
we expect higher interest expense for fiscal due to an increase in borrowing levels  particularly during the first half of the fiscal year 
apogee s effective income tax rate was of pre tax earnings from continuing operations  down marginally from the rate recorded in fiscal apogee s equity in the net loss of affiliated companies was million in fiscal compared to  a year ago 
apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations declined to million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
earnings from operations of discontinued businesses was million after tax  or diluted earnings per share  compared to an after tax net loss from operation of discontinued businesses of million  or diluted loss per share 
apogee s fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to a net loss of million  or diluted loss per share  a year ago 
the return on average shareholders equity was in fiscal versus a negative return of for fiscal segment analysis the following information provides a more detailed look at each of our two business segments

the segment s results were primarily affected by the suspension and relocation of viratec thin films viratec optium cathode ray tube crt coating line  and the start up costs and disruptions associated with the segment s other capital projects 
the segment s results were also affected by significantly lower demand for viratec s anti glare filter and front surface mirror products due to the economic slowdown in asia and temporary issues related to capacity limitations at viracon that slowed production and caused additional costs during the second quarter 
viracon s net sales were slightly lower than a year ago 
the architectural glass fabrication unit s operating earnings fell  reflecting the second quarter operational difficulties noted above and start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility 
viracon ran near full capacity for much of the year  even as expanded production capacity was added 
viracon s production outpaced its shipments by a considerable margin during the year  which also adversely affected operating earnings and resulted in increased finished goods inventory 
during the year  viracon began and largely completed construction of a new architectural glass fabrication complex in statesboro  georgia 
the statesboro facility began production in march together with capacity improvements at the unit s minnesota facility  viracon s capacity over the next two fiscal years will increase by over viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates  reported a net sales decline 
viratec recorded an operating loss in fiscal compared to solid operating earnings a year earlier 
as noted  the unit was adversely affected by the suspension of the optium crt coating line and significantly lower demand for its anti glare filter and front surface mirror products due to the economic slowdown in asia 
the crt coating line was suspended in connection with its relocation from minnesota to southern california  a location closer to the flow of customers computer monitor supply chains 
the optium line resumed production in september and began ramping up production levels to meet sales orders commitments received from customers 
viratec also continued to proceed with the addition of a new large scale flat glass coating line in its minnesota facility  which is expected to go on line in the summer of tru vue  the segment s custom art frame glass and matboard fabrication unit  posted a improvement in sales  while earnings rose by 
these results reflected increased penetration of the unit s value added products and success in the control of production costs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  tru vue broke ground for a new facility in the chicago area 
the new facility was completed in the spring of and will allow greater production capacity and efficiency 
wausau architectural products wausau  which manufactures commercial windows and provides painting and anodizing services  leveraged marginally higher net sales into a operating income gain 
wausau continued to benefit from improvements in its engineering and fabrication capabilities 
based on its year end backlog  continued evidence of strong demand for architectural glass products and the full year operation of viratec s optium crt coating line  gt expects to report higher net sales and operating earnings in fiscal net sales and operating income improvements will depend partly on the ramp up of the productive capacity added in fiscal or coming online in fiscal the segment s expansions also will result in significantly higher depreciation expense in fiscal glass services gs operates auto glass businesses under the harmon autoglass harmon  harmon solutions group solutions  glass depot and viracon curvlite names 
due to an industry merger in  gs became the second largest company in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
in addition  gs includes harmon  inc  a provider of building glass installation and replacement services in several major metropolitan areas 
gs reported a net sales improvement in fiscal  while operating earnings rose by 
net sales of the unit increased  reflecting increased market share and manufactured windshield sales  and the addition of retail and distribution locations 
operating income for the auto glass businesses increased 
sales growth continued to outpace the industry 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us fell nominally in same location retail net sales rose by  while unit net sales increased 
during the year  harmon increased sales to insurance companies through solutions 
the segment also continued to proceed with efforts to improve productivity for its auto glass repair and replacement operations 
the segment s manufacturing operation  viracon curvlite  fabricates auto glass for the replacement auto glass aftermarket 
viracon curvlite increased net sales in fiscal by about 
the unit s national distribution center  which offers other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and the autoglass express program  a delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for much of the unit s net sales growth 
about of viracon curvlite s net sales were made to the glass depot unit in fiscal on may   the segment acquired an interest in vis n service corporation vis n  an insurance claims and policy processing outsource company headquartered in red wing  minnesota 
this acquisition will expand the segment s capabilities to outsource insurance claims and policy processing beyond its traditional auto glass market 
during the year  the segment sold its midas muffler franchises to better focus on its auto glass operations 
the harmon  inc business had another solid year 
net sales grew by more than  while operating income rose by more than 
continuing operating improvements and a shift in net sales mix towards higher margin business helped the unit s profitability 
during the year  gs completed several small acquisitions of retail glass shops 
these acquisitions  combined with other locations added during the year  increased the number of locations to harmon retail stores and glass depot distribution centers 
the segment expects to report higher net sales in fiscal with unit growth from market penetration  and the start up or acquisition of locations 
meanwhile  the segment is taking actions to reduce its cost structure and improve productivity  particularly in its retail operations 
however  the unpredictability of industry unit sales and pricing makes it difficult to project operating earnings for fiscal discontinued operations in fiscal  apogee s board of directors authorized the divestiture of our detention security and domestic curtainwall operations 
on december   the segment executed the sale of its detention security business  effective november  on april   the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its domestic curtainwall operations 
combined with last year s exit from international curtainwall operations  these transactions effectively remove apogee from the large scale construction business 
accordingly  these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
operating results from the businesses reported as discontinued operations improved dramatically over those recorded a year ago 
for fiscal  earnings from discontinued operations amounted to million after tax compared to an after tax net loss from discontinued operations of million in fiscal domestic curtainwall operations reported solid earnings  while the detention security business reported nominal income prior to its sale 
the exit from european curtainwall operations remained on track  and the asian curtainwall unit had essentially completed the remaining projects in its backlog 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion restates the prior year s discussion of fiscal compared to fiscal to reflect the effect of reporting certain businesses as discontinued operations in fiscal consolidated net sales increased to million in fiscal the company s glass technologies gt and glass services gs segments reported net sales gains of and  respectively 
gt s net sales grew primarily due to continued strong demand for its fabricated glass products  particularly the viracon unit s high performance architectural glass 
gs increased net sales by combining nominal retail same store net sales growth  the addition of retail and wholesale locations  and the full year inclusion of portland glass  which the segment acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to  its lowest figure this decade 
productivity gains at most of our fabrication operations  most notably viracon and viratec thin films viratec  combined to produce most of this positive variance 
these factors were partly offset by higher material costs experienced by the gs segment s retail and distribution operations 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million  or  and increased as a percent of net sales 
the primary factors were higher salaries  increased outside services  and information systems and marketing costs  particularly at our gs segment 
sg a expenses in fiscal also included a million write off of certain information systems assets  primarily in gs  and severance costs associated with certain management changes 
net interest expense rose to million in fiscal increased interest income from investments held by the company s captive insurance subsidiary and lower interest rates partly offset the effect of higher borrowings under our revolver and uncommitted credit lines 
apogee s effective income tax rate was compared to in fiscal the increase mainly reflected the unusually low effective rate in fiscal associated with the resolution of prior years tax examinations 
our share of net losses recorded by various affiliated companies in which we have a or less equity interest amounted to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations dropped to million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share a year earlier 
in fiscal  the net loss from operations of discontinued businesses  net of income tax benefit  totaled million  or diluted loss per share 
the loss from operations of discontinued businesses  net of tax effect  amounted to  or diluted loss per share  in fiscal the significant net loss in fiscal related primarily to international curtainwall operations  which included two nonrecurring pre tax charges totaling million 
apogee s fiscal net loss was million  or diluted loss per share  versus net earnings of million  or diluted earnings per share  in fiscal the negative return on average shareholders equity was in fiscal versus a positive return of for fiscal segment analysis the following information provides a more detailed look at our two business segments 
also see note business segment data on page for a three year history of each segment s net sales  operating income  identifiable assets  capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization 
glass technologies gt posted record net sales and operating income for the fifth consecutive year 
net sales rose by  while operating income improved to million 
the net sales increase reflected improvements by each of the segment s units 
most of the segment s earnings improvement came from viracon  our high performance architectural glass fabrication unit 
viracon posted net sales and operating income growth of and  respectively 
the gains were due to strong demand for its architectural glass products  improved product mix  and improved productivity 
viracon ran near full capacity during the year 
in response to continued strong demand for the segment s high performance architectural glass products  viracon planned to begin construction of a new architectural glass fabrication complex in statesboro  georgia 
this facility  expected to be operational in fiscal  together with enhancements at viracon s existing facility  was expected eventually to increase viracon s capacity by over 
viratec reported improved results in fiscal viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates  saw its net sales grow by  while operating earnings nearly quadrupled 
both improvements were primarily due to viratec s optium cathode ray tube coating operation formerly known as cart 
optium net sales more than doubled for the year and the unit reported a small operating profit versus a sizable loss in the prior year 
viratec s flat glass operations had a double digit net sales gain  but industry pricing pressure and production downtime related to an ongoing capacity expansion caused that operation to report lower earnings 
at february   viratec s backlog was lower than last year s year end backlog  primarily due to the planned suspension of the optium business related to its expected relocation 
during fiscal  viratec s optium line is expected to be relocated closer to the flow of customers computer monitor supply chains  reducing shipping costs and breakage risks 
the segment s tru vue unit  our custom art frame glass and matboard fabricator  also posted improved net sales and operating earnings for the year 
these results occurred despite somewhat soft industry sales  as the unit again successfully controlled its production costs 
tru vue planned to construct a new facility in fiscal this would allow for increased capacity and improved productivity for both its art frame glass and matboard operations 
the wausau architectural products unit leveraged higher net sales into greater profitability as the unit improved its engineering and fabrication productivity 
this business entered fiscal with backlog nearly higher than a year earlier 
glass services gs operates retail stores under the harmon autoglass harmon name and distribution centers under the glass depot name 
due to an industry merger in  gs became the second largest company in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
in addition  gs includes harmon  inc  which provides building installation and replacement glass services in several major metropolitan areas 
gs reported an net sales improvement in fiscal despite lower unit sales demand in the auto glass replacement industry 
approximately one third of the net sales growth was due to the fourth quarter fiscal acquisition of portland glass 
the segment s net sales growth continued to outpace the industry 
market data indicated that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us fell from the prior year 
despite the net sales increase  gs s operating income fell to million  a decline 
margin pressures intensified throughout the year due to intense competition  particularly at the retail level 
lower margins and higher selling and administrative costs were the primary factors behind the decline 
the segment also recorded a million write off of certain information systems assets 
same location retail net sales rose by  while unit net sales declined 
the viracon curvlite auto glass fabrication operation increased net sales by about 
the unit s national distribution center  which offers other manufacturers products as well as its own for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and the autoglass express program  a delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for much of the unit s net sales growth 
about of curvlite s net sales were made to glass depot units in fiscal the segment s harmon  inc business had another solid year  generating slightly higher net sales 
a favorable shift in net sales mix towards higher margin business helped the unit to report another year of solid operating results 
during the year  gs completed four small acquisitions 
these acquisitions  combined with other locations added during the year  increased the number of locations to harmon retail locations and glass depot distribution centers 
the segment continued to explore opportunities to expand the reach of its businesses 
the merger of the industry s two largest companies provided gs with an enhanced position as insurance companies adjust their allocations of business to maintain their own flexibility and access to competitive pricing 
insurance companies  which make up about of the replacement auto glass market  prefer vendors who can expedite claims processing and other administrative efforts related to auto glass replacement and repair 
the segment has the ability to offer comprehensive claims processing services to these customers on a nationwide basis 
discontinued operations businesses reported as discontinued operations reported a net loss  net of income tax benefit  of million in fiscal compared to a net loss  net of tax effect  of  in fiscal the significant net loss in fiscal related primarily to international curtainwall operations  which included two nonrecurring pre tax charges totaling million 
the domestic curtainwall and detention security contracting businesses reported solid results for the year  slightly offsetting the losses suffered by the international operations 
domestic and international curtainwall net sales fell by and  respectively  due primarily to the decision to focus more selectively on higher margin domestic curtainwall business and the closure of our asian curtainwall business 
the two nonrecurring pre tax charges amounting to million related to exit activities and other unusual items 
a million pre tax provision for restructuring and other unusual items was recorded in the third quarter 
the provision also included amounts for the estimated loss associated with certain disputed construction contract receivables in europe  including the accrual of certain penalty amounts  and the accrual of costs associated with the resolution of legal proceedings related to organizational changes in its european curtainwall unit 
in the fourth quarter  apogee recorded a million pre tax provision for exiting all european curtainwall and related operations  including the completion of certain remaining projects 
in addition to the nonrecurring charges  international curtainwall operations posted an operating loss in excess of million  reflecting significant cost overruns at certain projects in europe and asia 
the operations also sustained sizable foreign currency translation losses on asian assets  particularly those held in malaysia 
despite a decline in net sales  our domestic curtainwall unit produced sharply higher profits  aided by the completion of the getty museum project as well as by reductions in overhead and operating costs 
the detention security unit also reported slightly higher net sales 
however  operating income for the unit fell as improved earnings from security systems contracting were offset by losses from a related start up operation 
in march  the five operating companies comprising our european curtainwall operations filed for bankruptcy or commenced liquidation  effectively relinquishing the company s control over these entities 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition net cash provided by financing activities in may  the company obtained a five year  committed credit facility in the amount of million 
this credit facility requires apogee to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios  and was initially secured by the company s receivables  inventory  equipment and intangibles 
this facility replaced a million five year  multi currency  committed credit facility obtained in may  which also required the maintenance of minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
the total commitment of the new credit facility was reduced by the sales price  net of taxes  of the sale of the detention security business  resulting in a committed credit facility of million as of february  the lenders security interest in apogee s assets was released during the year upon the achievement of certain financial ratios 
long term debt  including current installments of million  stood at million at february   up million from a year earlier 
virtually all of the company s long term debt consisted of bank borrowings 
the additional borrowings were primarily required to fund capital spending and dividends in excess of cash flow from operations  which included proceeds of million from the sale of the company s detention security business unit 
in december  apogee entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  which effectively converted million of its variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
for fiscal  we expect that outstanding borrowings will increase during the first half of the year to fund working capital variations  capital spending and dividends in excess of the anticipated cash flow from operations 
debt levels are expected to decline during the latter half of the year 
apogee believes that cash from operating activities and the available credit facility provides the company adequate liquidity for the next twelve months 
net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by continuing operating activities in fiscal rose to million  up from million in fiscal the increase primarily reflected a net favorable change in working capital  which included the receipt of refundable income taxes associated with the company s fiscal net loss 
net receivables increased million  which essentially tracked sales growth in the last quarter of the fiscal year 
most of our million increase in inventories was at gt  reflecting the segment s higher activity level and increased level of finished goods 
nominal changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and billings in excess of costs and earnings on uncompleted contracts all produced favorable changes to working capital 
net cash used in investing activities new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additions to property  plant and equipment totaled million 
major expenditures included the construction of an architectural glass fabrication facility in statesboro  georgia  and the relocation of viratec s optium cathode ray tube coating line to san diego  california 
other expenditures included additions of manufacturing equipment and the upgrading of information systems throughout the company 
the gs segment purchased an interest in an insurance claims and policy processing company for million and completed several small acquisitions of retail auto glass replacement stores for million 
in fiscal  the company expects capital spending of approximately million 
plans include expenditures for the completion of the new tru vue facility near chicago  illinois  as well as additions of manufacturing equipment and information systems throughout the company 
shareholders equity at february   apogee s shareholders equity stood at million  up from a year ago 
book value per share also rose to  up from per share a year ago  as outstanding common shares increased only nominally during the year 
net earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock under our stock based compensation plans accounted for the increases  which were partly offset by dividends paid and the repurchase of  shares of common stock 
during the year  apogee increased its quarterly dividend by to cents per share 
market risks the company s principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage the company s direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of the company s balance sheet  primarily debt obligations  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
the aforementioned changes in interest rates affecting the company s financial instruments would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
the company also routinely uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency donominated monetary assets and liabilities  and future firm commitments of its operations 
forward exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements 
the primary objective of these hedging activities is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
given the company s balanced foreign exchange position shown above  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these contracts are based would result in exchange losses from these contracts that would  in all material respects  be fully offset by exchange gains on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
however  since the cost of many of our inventories is determined using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  cost of sales  except for depreciation expense included therein  generally reflects current costs 
the cost of glass  one of our primary raw materials  was essentially unchanged from a year ago 
we expect the cost of glass to remain essentially unchanged in fiscal aluminum prices at year end were slightly lower than a year ago 
while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor cost increases  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose moderately in fiscal and a moderate increase also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal other costs are managed to minimize the inflationary pressures that exist in markets for goods and services that apogee s business operations require 
impact of year the company has been evaluating  with the assistance of independent software consultants  its information technology it systems  non it systems  and third party readiness for compliance with year requirements 
for these purposes  the company defines its it systems as those hardware and software systems which comprise its central management information systems and its telephone systems 
all other systems  including those involved in local  on site product design or manufacturing  are considered non it systems 
third parties include all the company s key suppliers and customers 
the assessment phase for the company s it systems is approximately complete 
remediation and implementation of the core operating and application programs within the it systems are approximately complete  and the intention is to be completed by october the costs related to year to complete this activity should not exceed million of both capital and expense  of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
of this projected cost  approximately million is related to accelerated replacement due to year concerns 
the company s businesses are approximately complete in the assessment phase regarding embedded operating and applications software and hardware within its non it systems 
the company expects to complete that assessment by june although the company is still in the assessment phase  based on currently known data about its non it systems  the company believes that the requirements for year remediation of its non it systems will be limited in nature 
while some issues have been identified  the company believes it can remediate all equipment to become year compliant and is in the process of doing so with the intent to be complete by august the company s businesses have contacted key customers and suppliers to assess year compliance within their organizations to assure no material interruption in these important third party relationships 
this dialogue and process will be ongoing throughout non compliant customers and suppliers will be evaluated in terms of the degree of risk posed to the company s business 
the company plans to develop third party contingency plans as it identifies critical partners with evidence of non compliance 
the company s contingency plans may include plans  where necessary  to establish additional or alternative sources of supply and channels of distribution 
if there were significant non compliance by key customers and suppliers  the company might experience a material adverse effect on the businesses with those specific third party relationships 
most of the company s businesses will remediate or replace portions of their software and hardware within the company s it systems and non it systems that are identified as requiring year remediation 
the company intends to address contingency planning with respect to its it systems  its non it systems and its third party relationships with key customers and suppliers 
based on the company s assessments completed to date  the company s total cost of addressing year issues is currently estimated to be in the range of to million  of which approximately million has already been incurred
