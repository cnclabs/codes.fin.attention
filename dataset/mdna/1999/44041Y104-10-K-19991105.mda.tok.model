item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a provider of employee assistance plans eap and behavioral health services to business and managed care organizations  as well as a leading contract manager of psychiatric and physical rehabilitation clinical programs offered by general acute care hospitals in the united states 
the company has grown both internally and through acquisitions  increasing both the variety of its treatment programs and services and the number of its management contracts 
as of august   the company had contracts to provide eap and managed behavioral health services covering over million lives 
over the last seven years  the company has increased its management contracts from to a total of as of august  and currently has contract locations in states 
of its management contracts  relate to mental health treatment programs and relate to physical rehabilitation programs 
the company has also developed a proprietary mental health outcomes measurement system known as cqi 
at august   the company provided outcome measurement services at contract locations as well as data services under various arrangements 
the company capitalizes on its expertise in managing the delivery of mental health services by directly offering managed behavioral health care services and employee assistance programs to businesses and managed care organizations 
the company believes it is strategically sized to deliver national programs  while providing local  individualized service to both employers and health plans and to their respective employees or members 
the company s strategy is to enhance its position as the leader in the contract management of mental health programs and to further expand the range of services which it offers to its client hospitals to include other clinical and related services and programs 
a significant challenge in marketing clinical management contracts is overcoming the initial reservations that many hospital administrators have with outsourcing key clinical services 
the company believes its expertise in working with hospital administrators  its reputation in the industry and its existing hospital contractual relationships provide it with a significant advantage in marketing new contracts 
the company also believes it has opportunities to cross sell management services of mental health and physical rehabilitation programs to client hospitals by marketing its mental health services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only physical rehabilitation programs  and by marketing its physical rehabilitation services to client hospitals for which the company currently manages only mental health programs 
the company is pursuing the development of such opportunities as a primary part of its business strategy 
the company has successfully expanded the breadth of services it offers to include the full continuum of mental health services  including outcome measurement services  and physical rehabilitation services 
its management contracts increasingly cover multiple services 
revenues managed behavioral health care services and employee assistance programs through its subsidiary horizon behavioral services  inc  the company offers an array of managed care products to corporate clients  self funded employer groups  commercial hmo and ppo plans  government agencies  and third party payors 
revenues are derived from eap services  administrative services only contracts  and at risk managed behavioral health services 
revenues from employee assistance programs  are typically based on a per employee per month capitated rate multiplied by the number of eligible employees 
the rate for eap plans is dependent upon services provided under the contract terms 
each plan is specifically written to fulfill the clients needs and can offer different numbers of counseling sessions and other benefits  such as child care and elder care consultation  referral resources and critical incident debriefing and intervention 
revenues for administrative services only contracts relate to the management of behavioral health benefits and are dependent upon the number of contracts and the services provided 
fees are usually a case rate or a per employee per month fee multiplied by the number of eligible members 
the client is able to benefit from the mental health professionals employed or independently contracted by the company at favorably discounted rates  as well as the company s expertise in clinical case management 
page the primary factors affecting revenues derived from managed care services are the behavioral health benefits provided and the number of members covered 
fees are based on a per employee per month capitated fee 
the capitated rate is dependent upon the benefit designs of the customer and is set forth in the contract  usually as a per member per month capitated rate  which is multiplied by the number of eligible members to determine a monthly fee 
the nine company owned clinics operated in the state of florida derive income from counseling and therapy services rendered 
they also provide services to patients who are employees of customers under various eap or managed care contracts 
mental health services the primary factors affecting revenues in a period are the number of management contracts with treatment programs in operation in the period and the number of services covered by each such management contract 
the company provides its management services under contracts with terms generally ranging from three to five years 
each contract is tailored to address the differing needs of each client hospital and its community and increasingly cover multiple treatment programs and services 
the company and the client hospital determine the programs and services to be offered by the hospital and managed by the company  which may consist of one or more mental health or physical rehabilitation treatment programs offering inpatient  partial hospitalization  outpatient or home health services 
under the contracts  the hospital is the actual provider of the mental health or physical rehabilitation services and utilizes its own facilities including beds for inpatient programs  nursing staff and support services such as billing  dietary and housekeeping in connection with the operations of its programs 
as the company has expanded the breadth of treatment programs it offers to hospitals  it began to move from managing one treatment program under a single contract with a hospital to managing multiple treatment programs under such contract 
contracts are frequently renewed or amended prior to or at their stated expiration dates 
some contracts are terminated prior to their stated expiration dates pursuant to agreement of the parties or early termination provisions included in the contracts 
as of august   and  the company had successfully retained  and  respectively  of the management contracts in existence at the beginning of such fiscal years 
the company believes the most frequent reason its client hospitals do not renew their contracts with the company is that the hospitals decide to manage such programs themselves 
in addition  a number of contracts have not renewed since passage of the balanced budget act due to a decline in profitability  resulting from unfavorable changes in medicare reimbursement 
under each contract  the company receives a fee for its management services from the client hospital 
management fees may be either a variable fee related in part to patient volume  a fixed monthly fee or reimbursement for direct program costs plus a fixed fee 
the management fee is frequently subject to periodic adjustments as a result of changes in the consumer price index or other economic factors 
payors  including medicare and medicaid  are attempting to manage costs  resulting in declining amounts paid or reimbursed to hospitals for the services provided 
as a result  the company anticipates that the number of patients served by general acute care hospitals on an inpatient basis will decrease and  as an alternative  the number of patients served on a per diem  episodic or capitated basis will increase in the future 
however  additional changes in medicare reimbursement may also unfavorably impact these groups as well 
over the past three years  the company has increased revenues through acquisitions discussed below and through internal growth by adding services  price escalators and volume increases at existing contract locations 
the increases have primarily been due to the increased range of services offered per contract and the increased demand for geropsychiatric services as general hospitals have sought to enter this market 
an additional factor in the pricing strategy has been the company s policy of establishing a minimum direct margin threshold for its management contracts 
because the pooling with specialty occurred on august   fiscal margins do not reflect the integration or the elimination of specialty s executive  administrative  accounting and personnel functions and information systems  the closing of two specialty office facilities and other synergies 
page the company s mix of programs has changed over the last four years reflecting the increased interest in geropsychiatric programs by general hospitals 
geropsychiatric programs as a percentage of the company s total mental health programs have increased from approximately to during that period 
most of the company s client hospitals receive reimbursement under one or more of the medicare or medicaid programs for mental health and physical rehabilitation services provided in programs managed by the company 
the company is paid directly by its client hospitals for the management services it provides 
under many of its management contracts the company is obligated to refund all or a portion of its fee if either medicare denies reimbursement to the client hospital for individual patient treatment or if the fee paid to the company is denied by medicare as a reimbursable cost 
during the fiscal years ended august  and  the company refunded approximately  and  respectively  of its fees as a result of these denials 
amendments to the medicare regulations in as part of the balanced budget act  established maximum reimbursement amounts on a per case basis for both inpatient mental health and physical rehabilitation services 
the regulations established a nationwide cap limiting the reimbursement amount on a per case basis for mental health and physical rehabilitation services for medicare fiscal years beginning october   and later  to  and  respectively  subject to adjustments based on market indices 
the reimbursement amounts were raised to  and  respectively for medicare fiscal years beginning october  and later 
in addition  these amendments established a new ceiling on the rate of increase in operating costs per case for mental health and physical rehabilitation services furnished to medicare beneficiaries 
prior to these amendments  the reimbursement limits were tied to the hospital s mental health or physical rehabilitation unit cost during the unit s first year of operations  subject to certain adjustments 
the limitations have resulted  in some cases  in decreased amounts reimbursed to the company s client hospitals 
this decrease in reimbursement has  in some cases  led to the renegotiation of a lower contract management fee and in other cases has resulted in the termination or nonrenewal of the management contract 
primarily as a result of these limitations  seven fewer contracts were signed by the company and the direct operating margin of the company s mental health contracts has decreased approximately six percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to the fiscal year ended august  the impact of the renegotiation  termination  or nonrenewal of management contracts was reduced by an increase in same store sales  that is contracts in operation for the entire year in both the current fiscal year and prior fiscal year  of for the fiscal year ended august  in addition  revenues per average number of contract locations in operation increased for fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
recent amendments to the medicare statutes also provide for the elimination of cost based reimbursement of partial hospitalization services effective upon days notice from medicare 
thereafter  reimbursement for partial hospitalization services based on the medicare outpatient prospective payment system pps will utilize a fixed reimbursement amount per patient day 
the currently proposed reimbursement rate per patient day is a wage adjusted rate of  which will lower medicare reimbursement levels to many hospitals for partial hospitalization services and therefore cause lower fees to be paid to the company under contracts for partial hospitalization services 
revenues from partial hospitalization services were million or of total contract management revenue for the year ended august  of the company s management contracts at august   or of the contracts include partial hospitalization services 
the termination of all partial hospitalization contracts  while unlikely and not expected  could reduce operating income approximately by million annually 
a recently enacted amendment to the medicare statutes provides for a gradual phase out of cost based reimbursement for physical rehabilitation services over a three year period commencing on october  the resulting phase in of reimbursement for physical rehabilitation services based on pps could significantly lower medicare reimbursements to hospitals and thus could have a material adverse effect on the business  operations and financial results of the company 
operating expenses the primary factor affecting operating expenses for the company s contract management business in any period is the number of programs in operation in the period 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and page benefits paid to its therapists and supporting personnel 
each mental health program managed by the company generally has a psychiatric medical director  a program director who is usually a psychologist or a social worker  a community relations coordinator and additional social workers or therapists as needed 
each physical rehabilitation program managed by the company generally has an independent medical director  a program director  and additional clinical staff tailored to meet the needs of the program and the client hospital  which may include physical and occupational therapists  a speech pathologist  a social worker and other appropriate supporting personnel 
each medical director has a contract with the company under which on site administrative services needed to administer the program are provided 
except for the nursing staff  which is typically provided by the hospital  the other program personnel are generally employees of the company 
at august   the company had an average of seven employees per contract location 
operating expenses for the company s managed behavioral health care services and employee assistance programs are comprised of approximately salaries and benefits and approximately medical claims from network providers 
medical claims includes payments to independent health care professionals providing services under the capitated mental health services contracts and employee assistance programs offered by the company 
other costs and expenses include items such as marketing costs and expenses  accounting and legal fees and expenses  employee relocation expenses  rent  utility and property taxes

other non year it efforts have not been materially delayed or impacted by year initiatives 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s result of operations  or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  suppliers or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems or results or operations 
the company has completed an analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has been developed for dealing with the most reasonably likely worse case scenario 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the date by which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which are derived utilizing numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include but are not limited to the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology  and similar uncertainties
