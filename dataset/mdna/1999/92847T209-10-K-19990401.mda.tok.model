item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained herein 
overview the company was historically engaged in designing and manufacturing precision acoustical and vibration instrumentation 
from through  the company acquired the rights to a number of technologies and dedicated significant time  effort  and expense to research and development efforts to create products designed for the chemical analysis instrumentation industry 
management in place during the acquisition phase of these technologies believed that these technologies placed the company in a position to develop a number of sophisticated analytical instruments in addition to its historical acoustical and vibration instrumentation business 
the company initiated research and development plans and developed certain commercial products based on these acquired technologies 
in addition  the company continued to introduce newly developed acoustic and vibration products 
however  there were unanticipated delays in the finalization of many of these products 
during this period of time  the company incurred significant losses  principally as a result of the expanded research and development effort and increased infrastructure put in place to deal with the anticipated increase in revenues 
the company was unable to fund its increased research  development  and other activities from operations  and sought and obtained equity financing  primarily from private placements to individual investors  in order to meet these costs 
in november  the board of directors  due in part to missed product deadlines and significant ongoing operating losses  replaced executive management of the company 
andrew c 
bebbington was appointed as the new chief executive officer of the company with the expectation of reversing the severe losses of the company through a combination of restructuring and redirection of priorities and leading the company into the next stage of its development 
mr 
bebbington  with the endorsement of the outside board members  immediately undertook an evaluation of all aspects of the company s operations  research and development projects  sales and marketing approaches  product offerings  personnel and management  contractual arrangements  and overall cost structure 
as a result  the new chief executive officer recommended  and the board of directors approved in december  restructuring steps and certain changes in the strategic direction of the company 
this resulted in a reduction of personnel  the cessation of certain business activities  a renewed focus on certain research and development projects  and a de emphasis or abandonment of other projects 
these restructuring activities and certain other events in the fourth quarter of resulted in unusual and nonrecurring charges to the statement of operations for the year ended december  in the aggregate amount of  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
clear goals and targets were set for each remaining business segment such that the technology would be profitable by the end of the third quarter of  could clearly demonstrate a path to profitability soon thereafter  or would be eliminated from the company s short term goals 
over the course of  the company continued to monitor each of the technologies in its portfolio in light of these goals and  where necessary  additional appropriate cost cutting measures were taken 
as a result  the company  by mutual consent  terminated its agreement with lucent technologies  inc  concerning certain development technologies and its distribution agreement with saes getters spa  concerning marketing its tof product 
the company also sold its sfc business to a group of former employees 
in each case  the company reduced personnel and overhead accordingly 
largely as a result of the discontinuance of these products and technologies  the company recorded unusual charges of  during see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
during the course of  the company  through its sensar division  completed the initial development of its jaguar technology 
in parallel with the development program  the company had been searching for a marketing partner for its mass spectrometer technology to provide additional distribution capability 
the company has now entered into an agreement with jeol regarding development and distribution of the company s jaguar time of flight mass spectrometer product 
this arrangement will provide the company with an additional  of research funds in and  subject to the company meeting certain design modification milestones  a minimum guaranteed purchase of jaguar instruments in development of the crosscheck product and exploration of its market potential is continuing 
in the second quarter of  the company terminated its marketing agreement with weidemann 
since the termination of this agreement  the company has approached and is now working with a utility company directly  and has begun the process of product evaluation directly with potential end users 
the company is continuing to work with a major pipeline company to develop a product for detecting the transition between petroleum products within pipelines 
this product has now been specified and an initial unit has been installed for field tests 
however  the successful commercialization of crosscheck for this application is subject to a number of risks and unknowns  including final technological feasibility  market acceptance  and acceptable commercial terms 
on the acoustics side  the company continued to invest in new product development during with the intention of upgrading the product line and improving its technical competitiveness 
at the same time  the company continued its cost cutting measures and took steps to implement operational discipline in the acoustics business 
significant improvement in the performance of the acoustics business based on a year to year comparison of results of operations was obtained 
management believes that these steps permitted the successful negotiation of the sale of the acoustics business to pcb 
under the terms of the agreement with pcb  the company received cash at closing of approximately million and a promissory note due april   in the principal amount of  pcb also assumed approximately  of the company s liabilities 
subject to the resolution of certain title and zoning issues  pcb will also acquire the manufacturing and administrative facilities of the company for an agreed price of million 
the company has a loan of approximately  that will be required to be paid in connection with this sale 
this cash infusion and decrease in debt will permit the company to redeem its series a preferred stock  which had a conversion feature very disadvantageous to the holders of common stock  and to have sufficient funds to bring its jaguar tof mass spectrometer and crosscheck products to market 
while management of the company continues to believe in  and is committed to  development of superior products designed to meet the needs of significant markets  the products currently being introduced and developed by the company are designed for sophisticated applications  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its development and marketing efforts or that alternative technologies may not be developed by some other entity that provide a more advantageous solution to the needs of the various industries targeted by the company 
if the company is unable to successfully develop and market the targeted products or market acceptance or development of such products is delayed  the company s ability to obtain the necessary financing to continue its research and development program may be adversely affected 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales for the year ended december  and  were  and  respectively 
acoustic sales represent of total company sales in compared to in sales have increased by  or  for as compared to the increase is principally due to an increase in sensar s chemical analysis for sales of  from  in to  in during  sensar had its first sales of jaguar and sfc totalling  tof sales and service declined by  acoustic sales were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
during the year ended december   export sales represented of net sales compared to for the year ended december  the company s export sales are billed  collected  and denominated in us dollars  other than its sales through its subsidiary  ltd  which are in british pounds sterling 
the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments has not historically been significant 
the company does not consider its foreign currency risks to be significant and has not taken a position in the currency markets or derivatives in an attempt to hedge any risk that might exist 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december   were  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increased level in costs of sales as a percentage of net sales for both and above historical levels are due to a variety of reasons 
for  the increased level of cost of sales is principally the result of inventory adjustments of approximately  in connection with the discontinuance of the tof product line and also due to the sales of tof and beta jaguar and sfc instruments in the sensar division for which the gross margin was less than normal margins for commercial instruments 
for  see the discussion at page under cost of sales for reasons for the increased level of cost of sales 
cost of sales for acoustic products during the year ended december   was of net sales reflecting personnel reductions in manufacturing overhead of six full time and four part time positions 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in the dollar amount of selling  general  and administrative expenses was principally due to progress on corporate objectives of cost control  achieved through personnel reductions and more aggressive procurement practices  such as budgetary constraints  preauthorization of all expenditures  seeking competitive quotes  etc 
reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses principally consist of decreases of approximately  in professional and consulting fees   in payroll and associated labor costs from a reduction of full time positions   in employee recruitment and relocation costs  and  in travel and related expenses 
additionally  depreciation and amortization expense decreased by approximately  principally due to the reduction in carrying value of certain assets at december  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales should continue to decline in the future as the company continues to seek to bring its expenses in line with its revenue estimates  although no assurance can be made that the company will be successful in accomplishing such reduction 
research and development for the year ended december   research and development costs were  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in the amount of research and development over the prior period  as well as over recent historical levels  is due primarily to the cost control measures discussed above  personnel reduction  and greater discipline over prototype activity  through a much stronger design control process that evaluates manufacturability  material costs  and market requirements prior to prototype development 
reductions in research and development costs principally consist of decreases of approximately  in materials and supplies principally used in prototype development  and  in payroll and associated labor costs from a reduction of full time positions 
additionally  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by approximately  principally due to the reduction in carrying value of certain assets at december  research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales should continue to decline in the future as the company continues to seek to bring its expenses in line with its revenue estimates  although no assurance can be made that the company will be successful in accomplishing such reduction 
unusual charges during the year ended december   the company recognized unusual charges of  principally resulting from the termination of the exclusive distribution arrangement with saes getters spa saes during september the unusual charges are composed of the writeoff of assets related to the discontinuance of the tof product in the amount of  a provision for costs related to the discontinuance of the tof and sfc products and closure of machine shop in the amount of  the expected loss on the disposal of the machine shop equipment of  and an allowances against receivables from former executive officers for  in october  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of sensar corporation sensar 
at the time  the business contained within sensar consisted of its time of flight technology as applied to its tof instrumentation 
the tof has been distributed on an exclusive basis over the past three years by saes  a global supplier of getter filters 
unfortunately  this product has failed to meet its full potential in the market place and negotiations commenced in july   with saes  which led by mutual agreement to the termination of the exclusive distribution arrangement during september the company has been seeking alternative distributors for this product or to sell this technology as a whole  but to date has been unsuccessful for several reasons  including the aggressive downturn in the semiconductor market 
as a result of these events  the company evaluated the carrying value of assets associated with the tof product and has recorded non cash charges for the writeoff of assets related to this product 
the writeoff principally consists of the unamortized excess purchase price of the sensar acquisition in the amount of  during  the company also decided to dispose of its sfc product line and close its machine shop 
as a result of these decisions  the company has provided  principally for expected exit costs related to these product lines 
future cash flows  which have been accrued related to these technologies  are expected to be the costs of customer support  payment of certain fixed costs for vacated space  and other winding up costs 
in addition   has been provided to cover the probable losses on the disposition of net assets related to the sfc product line 
other components of the unusual charges include the expected loss of approximately  from the disposal of the machine shop and an allowance against a receivable due from the former ceo 
during  management concluded that it was not cost effective for the company to continue to operate its own machine shop and decided to sell the machine shop equipment and payoff the capital leases associated with the equipment 
also during  management of the company concluded that the collectibility of approximately  due from the former ceo to the company was in doubt 
the amount due originated from withholding taxes paid by the company on behalf of the ceo in conjunction with the issuance of stock to him as a result of the restructuring of the company 
additionally  with the decline in the price of the company s common stock  an uncertainty has arisen regarding the ability of the former executives to fully pay their notes from the exercise of options 
accordingly  the company has provided an allowance of  against the notes at december  comparison of years ended december  and the company changed its fiscal year end from june to december  effective december  the company s audited financial statements cover the six months ended december   and the year ended june  financial information for the year ended december   is unaudited but has been derived from these two periods and is presented for comparative purposes only 
net sales net sales for the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of  or  for as compared to the overall decrease is principally the result of a decrease in sales in the acoustical and vibration product families 
sales of acoustical and vibration products for the year ended december   reflect decreases from primarily due to the delayed introduction of certain new products 
the company originally anticipated that these new acoustical products would be available at the beginning of the introduction of the company s model and dsp series products only began shipping in commercial quantities in late and the introduction of the model and associated options have been delayed with volume shipments starting in the first quarter of in the interim  sales of the company s prior products declined 
revenue from the company s chemical analysis instruments was approximately the same as in the company marketed its tof to the semi conductor industry through saes 
under the terms of the marketing agreement  saes was obligated to sell a minimum of nine units in in order to maintain its exclusive rights  a target that was not met 
sales of the tof through saes were historically hampered by the parties inability to mutually agree on acceptable performance standards for the instrumentation and the company has had difficulty in meeting certain heightened specifications required by certain new end users 
at december   the company reversed revenue recognition in the amount of approximately  on two units pending resolution of certain issues that was originally recognized in the third quarter 
during the year ended december   export sales were comparable to the prior year representing of net sales compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december  was  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due to a variety of significant factors  including the absorption of an estimated  of higher fixed manufacturing expenses and personnel costs on decreased acoustic and vibration sales in  an estimated  of costs related to meeting heightened specifications of the tof product and certain related other provisions for that product  increases of  in estimated provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  principally associated with the restructuring of operations and changes in strategic direction of the company  and increases during the fourth quarter of  in the company s estimated provisions for warranty work 
with the restructuring of the company in late  new senior management established an objective to redevelop the company s product portfolio on a three year rotating cycle 
prior to the restructuring  products were not redeveloped unless product demand decreased significantly 
many acoustic products had been in the company s product portfolio since prior to with the change in managerial direction  certain quantities of raw materials on hand were now in excess of expected demand 
management evaluated such quantities and increased estimated reserves against those inventories for the estimated losses 
the company also revised its estimates for warranty reserves during the year principally related to the tof product and certain related performance issues 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general  and administrative expenses was due to several corporate objectives and activities  including increased costs associated with the pursuit of strategic marketing and research alliances  costs associated with the implementation of a new electronic data processing system  costs associated with holding a shareholders meeting in  including the preparation of the annual report and proxy statement  the cost of additional employees necessary to establish the infrastructure to support the company s anticipated growth  the recruitment and relocation costs of the new chief executive officer  and costs associated with other corporate and marketing activities 
the increases in selling  general  and administrative expenses in support of these objectives and activities were primarily reflected as increases of approximately  for compensation and associated labor costs principally for new employees in anticipation of growth in the company   for employee recruitment and relocation costs principally incurred in the fourth quarter for the new chief executive officer   for stockholder relations and outside director costs   for travel and related expenses   for software maintenance  installation  and training costs  and  for depreciation on the increased capital equipment acquired 
research and development research and development expenses increased to  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in the amount of research and development expenses over the prior period  as well as over historical levels  is due to the company s continuing commitment to the research and development of new products from technologies acquired in recent years 
the increased expenses principally relate to increases of approximately  for compensation and associated labor costs principally of additional scientists and engineers   in materials and supplies primarily used in prototype development of the tof mass spectrometer and sfc products which progressed on an increasing scale through the year   for depreciation on the increased capital equipment acquired  and  for consulting  legal  and other outside services received 
historical levels of research and development costs as a percentage of sales for the fiscal years ended june  to  averaged approximately of sales 
unusual and nonrecurring charges during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized unusual and nonrecurring charges in the amount of  the charges include restructuring charges of  which are primarily composed of termination costs for former management of  and writeoff of the unamortized costs of the company s enoms technology in the amount of  the termination costs of former management include the market value of the  shares of the company s common stock issued to them  plus severance payments paid in connection with their termination agreements 
the enoms technology was an internally developed proprietary software system for environmental noise monitoring 
as a result of the new chief executive officer s evaluation of all aspects of the company s operations and product offerings  the enoms technology was abandoned  resulting in the writeoff of the remaining cost of this technology 
the company also recognized impairment losses of  in the fourth quarter of  related to the write down of the carrying value of certain assets 
the principal component of the impairment charge was the write down of the carrying value of the long term contractual agreement in the amount of  see note s to the consolidated financial statements for details of this arrangement 
the carrying value of this asset is dependent on the future revenue stream derived from the sale of environmental noise monitoring systems 
this market has become increasingly competitive forcing a probable renegotiation of this contract 
the carrying value of this asset at december   has been reduced to management s estimate of its current value  the amount of the guaranteed minimum royalties through august   the date when the other party to the contract can first unilaterally cancel the contract 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
non cash portions of the unusual and nonrecurring charges were approximately  in addition to the unusual and nonrecurring charges of  discussed above  certain other adjustments were recorded in the financial statements during the fourth quarter of largely as a result of the change in strategic direction of the company  certain inventories were rendered obsolete or overstocked 
accordingly  a write down in the carrying value of inventories to salvage value in the amount of  was recognized in the fourth quarter of additionally  the company recognized other adjustments and significant expenses related to increases in the estimated provision for warranty work  adjustments to inventories related to the absorption of labor and overhead into cost of sales  and the reversal of the sales revenue recorded in the third quarter of in the approximate amount of  for two instruments for uncertainties involving final acceptance of the instruments by the customer 
other material expenses recorded in the fourth quarter in excess of normal operating expenses include increasing costs incurred towards the development of the tof mass spectrometer and the sfc products and costs associated with the recruitment and relocation of the new chief executive officer 
comparison of six months ended december  and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the six months ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents an increase of  or  for as compared to the acquisition of sensar occurred october  as such  the operations of sensar are included for the entire six month period ended december   while the operations of sensar were only included for approximately two months of the six month period ended december  the increase in sales is principally due to increased revenue from sensar products of approximately during the six months ended december   export sales experienced a significant increase as a percentage of total sales  to of sales 
this growth was due to a continuing increase in sales to the pacific rim and increases in sales in europe  compared to the prior period 
domestic sales  on an annualized basis  declined compared to the prior year  but have increased compared to and cost of sales cost of sales for the six months ended december   were  or of net sales  compared to  or of sales  for the six months ended december  this elevated level of cost compared to historical levels continues principally due to high cost of materials  initial production costs  and development costs associated with production of initial sensar products 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from for the six months ended december   to for the corresponding period of the increase was due to several factors  including increased audit  legal  and consulting fees  establishment of a new european sales manager  and increased costs related to various corporate and marketing activities 
research and development for the six months ended december   research and development costs were  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  for the six months ended december  the increase over the prior period  as well as increases above historical levels  is reflective of the company s continuing commitment to the development of new products 
comparison of years ended june  and net sales net sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june   and  were  and  respectively 
this represents an approximate increase in its acoustic and vibration instrumentation sales 
the increased sales were attributable to a general expansion of the underlying market  and an increase in the unit sales of the company s products 
the acquisition of sensar on october   did not materially impact the net sales for the year ended june   with approximately  in revenue attributable to the sensar operations during that period 
during  export sales declined from to of total sales 
this decline was the result of decreased sales in europe  but was also due to strong sales increases domestically 
cost of sales the company s cost of sales of  in the year ended june   and  in the year ended june   increased as a percentage of sales from continuing operations to from 
the increase in was due primarily to the high cost of materials  initial production costs  and development costs associated with production of initial sensar products 
prior to the company s acquisition  sensar purchased major electronics subsystems from a third party 
the pricing structure was based on the premise of a high price for a limited number of systems to provide the manufacturer a way to recover development costs 
since the acquisition of sensar  the company has designed a replacement subsystem which reduced the cost of the electronics for this component by approximately 
because of the use of the remaining highly priced electronics subsystems in sensar s inventory in fiscal year june   the entire material and development costs were expensed during the period 
selling  general  and administrative selling  general  and administrative expenses remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales  for the year ended june  this represents a small decline when compared to the year ended june   when selling  general  and administrative expenses were  or of net sales 
research and development the company is involved in a high tech industry which demands constant improvements and development of its instrumentation to remain technically viable 
since its inception  the company has dedicated significant operating funds to research and development 
for the five fiscal years june  to  research and development expenses averaged approximately of net sales and in the year ended june   were  or approximately of net sales 
for the fiscal year ended june   research and development expenses were  approximately of net sales 
this level of research and development reflects management s commitment to develop new products to enhance the revenue potential of the company 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   the company had total current assets of  and  respectively  including cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
the company had total current liabilities at december  and december  of  and  respectively  resulting in working capital of  and  respectively and working capital ratios of to and to  respectively 
the company s primary source of cash for the years ended december  and  was from the issuance of preferred and common stock and from the exercise of options and warrants in the aggregate amount of  and  respectively 
the company s primary use of cash for the years ended december  and  were funds used in operations of  and  respectively 
the company also used  for the termination of its line of credit during the year ended december   because limitations on the borrowing base for this line of credit had become so restrictive that it was not a significant source of reasonably priced working capital 
in  the company entered into a mortgage arrangement when it purchased its current plant 
the terms of the mortgage involved a five year balloon payment at january  included in current maturities of long term debt on the balance sheet at december   is the balance of the mortgage in the amount of  the company has obtained the consent of the mortgage lender to a short extension of the due date for the balloon payment to july   and this obligation will be paid as part of the sale of the real property 
the company has significantly reduced its historically heavy use of cash to fund the losses in the acoustic business and the continued investment in research in sensar 
nevertheless  the company is still not operating on a cash positive basis and hence continues to reduce its cash resources 
as a result of these continuing losses and the decreasing cash reserves of the company  management elected to negotiate the sale of the acoustics business to pcb 
the series a preferred stock placed by the company in contain a beneficial conversion feature 
the company was concerned that the decrease in the company s stock price combined with the potential for conversion of the series a preferred stock and subsequent sale of the common stock received  created a market overhang that was potentially detrimental to the shareholders of the company 
the company sought and obtained the agreement of the holders of the remaining series a preferred stock to sell their stock back to the company 
the company intends to use approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of the acoustics business to redeem the series a preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the moratorium agreement entered into in january after payment of the associated costs and meeting its other obligations  the company expects to have cash reserves of approximately million on completion of the sale 
the company believes that it can sustain its current sensar operation for the short and medium term with its current working capital and by taking into account the  cash injection which jeol is contracted to pay to sensar in the first four months of as product demand is achieved  management believes that its long term operating and capital requirements will be funded principally through cash generated from operations  supplemented as necessary from equity or long term debt financing 
management believes that current cash on hand  will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its operating needs and development plans and will provide funds for possible future acquisitions and the redemption of the series a preferred stock 
however  should the costs of introduction and support of its products exceed the company s expectations  the company would be unable to sustain its current level of overhead and would either need to reduce its commitment to certain projects or to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance as to the company s ability to obtain such financing on terms favorable to it 
in addition  there can be no assurance as to the timing of increased sales or as to the success of the products that may ultimately permit the company to meet its obligations from operations 
year the company has largely completed its assessment of year issues that affect its business 
as part of its assessment  the company has evaluated its internal information systems  including its accounting  manufacturing  and networking software  its outside payroll service  its telecommunications systems  its file servers and workstations  and other applications software and instrumentation 
the company also reviewed its noninformation technology systems  including bench top tools  environmental chambers  and laboratory equipment 
the company has sought and obtained verification from each of the vendors responsible for the software and hardware referred to above  indicating that the software and hardware is year compliant 
where necessary  the company has installed the software patches and upgrades provided by the vendor to make the systems year compliant 
the company has also made an assessment of the products that it sells for year compliance 
in some cases  product firmware required modification to be year compliant 
the necessary modifications have been made for all products currently in the company s product portfolio to be year compliant 
this upgraded firmware has been made available to customers  either through the company s web site or through a program to update products that should be returned to the company 
some of the company s customers are using product versions that the company will not support for year issues 
the company is encouraging these customers to upgrade to current product versions that are year compliant 
the company is currently on track to complete all necessary modifications prior to december  the company has spent an estimated  in these efforts to date and has budgeted an additional  for the remainder of the company has also conducted a survey of its business partners and vendors for their year compliance 
the company has obtained written verification that all business partners and significant vendors are either year compliant or that they are on track to be fully compliant before the year the company believes that there are no significant vendors that  if they failed to become year compliant  could not be replaced with other vendors that are 
based on its review and the steps it has taken to date  the company has not adopted a formal year contingency plan to address unresolved or undetected issues 
while the company believes that it has taken prudent steps to assess and mitigate the effects of year issues  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies with which the company deals  or upon which the company s internal systems rely  will not fail or have significant year problems 
in such event  significant technical resources could be diverted from the company s ongoing development work and technical support functions until such issues were resolved 
the costs to the company of making its assessment of year compliance  including installing necessary patches and upgrades and upgrading its own firmware for its products has not been  nor is it expected to be  significant to its financial statements
