item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis includes forecasts of future results of operations which are considered forward looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results could differ materially from these forecasts  and there can be no assurance that these forecasts of future results will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the presently estimated results include our continued ability to effectively compete for the country s top horses and trainers necessary to field high quality horse racing  our continued ability to grow our share of the interstate simulcast market  a substantial change in allocation of live racing days  the impact of competition from alternative gaming including riverboat and cruise ship casinos and lotteries and other sports and entertainment options in those markets in which we operate  a decrease in riverboat admissions revenue from our indiana operations  year computer issues and our success in pursuit of our strategic initiatives designed to attract new patrons and generate additional revenues 
overview we conduct pari mutuel wagering on live thoroughbred and standardbred horse racing and simulcast audio and video feeds of races 
additionally  we offer racing services through our other interests 
we own and operate churchill downs racetrack in louisville  kentucky churchill facility  which has conducted thoroughbred racing continuously since and is internationally known as home of the kentucky derby 
we also own and operate ellis park race course  a thoroughbred racetrack  in henderson  kentucky ellis park  and the kentucky horse center  a thoroughbred training center  in lexington  kentucky 
additionally  we are the majority owner and operator of hoosier park in anderson  indiana  which conducts thoroughbred  quarter horse and standardbred horse racing 
we conduct simulcast wagering on horse racing at our four simulcast wagering facilities in louisville  kentucky  and in merrillville  fort wayne and indianapolis  indiana  as well as at our three racetracks 
because of the seasonal nature of our business  revenues and operating results for any interim quarter are not indicative of the revenues and operating results for the year and are not necessarily comparable with results for the corresponding period of the previous year 
we normally earn a substantial portion of our net earnings in the second quarter of each year during churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks are run 
the kentucky derby and the kentucky oaks are run on the first weekend in may 
our primary sources of income are commissions and fees earned from pari mutuel wagering on live and simulcast horse races 
other sources of income include admissions and seating  riverboat admission tax subsidy  concession commissions primarily for the sale of food and beverages  sponsorship revenues  and license  rights and broadcast fees 
churchill downs and ellis park  which we acquired during the second quarter of  as well as kentucky s other racetracks are subject to the licensing and regulation of the kentucky racing commission krc 
the krc consists of members appointed by the governor of kentucky 
licenses to conduct live thoroughbred race meetings and to participate in simulcasting are approved annually by the krc based upon applications submitted by the racetracks in kentucky 
although to some extent churchill downs and ellis park compete with other racetracks in kentucky for the awarding of racing dates  the krc is required by state law to consider and seek to preserve each racetrack s usual and customary live racing dates 
generally  there is no substantial change from year to year in the racing dates awarded to each racetrack 
churchill downs conducted live racing from april through june   and from november through november   for a total of racing days compared to racing days in ellis park conducted live racing from june through september   for a total of racing days compared to days in  which was prior to our acquisition of ellis park 
we received approval from the krc to conduct live racing at churchill downs from april through june  spring meet and from october through november  fall meet for a total of days 
ellis park has been granted a total of live racing days running from june through september  the total number of days on which churchill downs and ellis park conduct live racing fluctuates annually according to the calendar year 
a substantial change in the allocation of live racing days at churchill downs or ellis park could adversely impact our operations and earnings in future years 
churchill downs hosted breeders cup day on november  breeders cup day is sponsored by breeders cup limited  a tax exempt organization chartered to promote thoroughbred racing and breeding 
the breeders cup day races are held annually  featuring million in purses  for the purpose of determining thoroughbred champions in eight different churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations events 
racetracks across the united states compete for the privilege of hosting the breeders cup day races each year  and the breeders cup was our fourth time hosting this event  the most of any racetrack 
although most of the income earned from this event was allocated to breeder s cup limited  hosting the event had a positive impact on our results 
in indiana  licenses to conduct live standardbred and thoroughbred race meetings  including quarter horse races  and to participate in simulcasting are approved annually by the indiana horse racing commission ihrc  which consists of five members appointed by the governor of indiana 
licenses are approved annually by the ihrc based upon applications submitted by hoosier park 
currently  hoosier park is the only facility in indiana licensed to conduct live standardbred  quarter horse or thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcasting 
quarter horse races are conducted during some thoroughbred race days 
hoosier park conducted live racing from april  through november   for a total of racing days  including days of standardbred racing and days of thoroughbred racing which also includes quarter horse races 
hoosier park received a license to conduct live racing in for a total of racing days  including days of standardbred racing and days of thoroughbred racing 
a substantial change in the allocation of live racing days at hoosier park could adversely impact our operations and earnings in future years 
we employ approximately full time employees 
due to the seasonal nature of our live racing business  the number of seasonal and part time persons employed will vary throughout the year  with peak employment occurring kentucky derby week when we employ as many as  persons 
through december   average full time and seasonal employment per pay period was approximately  individuals 
we generally do not directly compete with other racetracks or simulcast wagering facilities for patrons due to geographic separation of such facilities 
however  we compete with other sports  entertainment and gaming options  including riverboat casinos and lotteries  for patrons for both live racing and simulcasting 
we attempt to attract patrons by providing the highest quality racing products in attractive entertainment facilities with fairly priced  appealing concession services 
churchill downs is the premier racetrack in kentucky for both live racing and simulcasting  based upon total handle and attendance  and hoosier park is the only facility in indiana providing pari mutuel wagering on live racing 
churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the development of riverboat gaming facilities began in indiana pursuant to authorizing legislation passed by the state of indiana in illinois had previously authorized riverboat gaming 
there are currently five riverboat casinos operating on the ohio river along kentucky s border including two in the southeastern indiana cities of lawrenceburg and rising sun  one in southwestern indiana in evansville and one at metropolis  illinois 
the fifth riverboat casino  licensed to rdi caesars world  opened in november in harrison county  indiana  miles from louisville 
admission and handle figures at the churchill downs racetrack during the rdi caesars world s opening week in november  were not significantly different from the same period in however  during december  when the rdi caesars riverboat casino and the louisville sports spectrum sports spectrum were concurrently open  admission and handle numbers at the sports spectrum decreased from those numbers for the same period in at this time  we cannot determine the extent to which the decrease was due to the new riverboat casino in the louisville market 
other factors  such as inclement weather  may also have had an impact 
the indiana gaming commission voted in september to grant a license to open a sixth indiana riverboat along the ohio river in switzerland county  about miles from louisville 
the license holder  hollywood park boomtown  inc  plans to build a riverboat casino  hotel and resort complex near vevay  indiana 
hollywood park estimates the resort will open as early as the third quarter of the full impact of riverboat casinos on kentucky racing cannot be accurately determined until all riverboats are open and the markets are fully matured 
studies project that churchill downs could experience a material adverse impact on its wagering and attendance in the louisville market when the rdi caesars world riverboat is open to full capacity and has established itself in the market 
these same studies projected similar declines in western and northern kentucky  but recent experience at ellis park and turfway park indicates the impact may not be as severe as these studies projected 
in addition to those riverboats operating along the ohio river  five riverboat casinos have opened along the indiana shore of lake michigan near our sports spectrum in merrillville  indiana 
our pari mutuel wagering activities at the merrillville facility have been adversely impacted by the opening of these lake michigan riverboats 
churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations additionally  the pokagon band of the potawatomi indian tribe has expressed an interest in establishing land based casinos in northeastern indiana and southwestern michigan although indiana governor frank o bannon has publicly expressed his opposition at this time to any further expansion of casino gaming in indiana 
we continue to anticipate that development of any such indian casino will negatively impact pari mutuel wagering activities at hoosier park s indiana facilities 
however  the extent of the impact is unknown at this time due  in part  to the uncertain geographic distances between hoosier park s operations and the potential casino sites 
the integration of alternative gaming products at our racetrack facilities is one of our four core business strategies developed to position us to compete in this changing environment 
implementing these strategies  we have successfully grown our live racing product by strengthening our flagship operations  increasing our share of the interstate simulcast market  and geographically expanding our racing operations in kentucky and into indiana 
alternative gaming in the form of video lottery terminals and slot machines should enable us to more effectively compete with indiana riverboat casinos and provide new revenue for purse money and capital investment 
we continue to pursue legislation to allow video lottery terminals at our racetrack facilities in kentucky 
currently  we are working with members of the kentucky horse industry to establish a consensus for a plan to operate video lottery terminals exclusively at kentucky s racetracks 
the horse industry in indiana presently receives 
per admission to indiana riverboats to compensate for the effect of riverboat competition 
the horse industry is required to allocate of such revenue directly for purse expenses  breed development and reimbursement of approved marketing costs 
the balance  or  is received by hoosier park as the only horse racetrack currently operating in indiana 
riverboat admissions revenue from our indiana operations increased million for the year ended december  compared to  as a result of the opening of additional riverboats 
the net increase in riverboat admissions revenue  after required purse and marketing expense increases of approximately million  is million 
legislation which seeks to cap hoosier park s share of the 
subsidy was introduced in the session of the indiana general assembly 
a significant change in hoosier park s share of the subsidy would impact funding churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for operating expenditures  potentially reducing the number of race dates at hoosier park and  in all likelihood  re emphasize the need for the integration of alternative gaming products at the hoosier park racetrack in order for it to effectively compete with riverboat casinos 
we have partnered with ods technologies lp ods in the development and operation of an in home interactive wagering system in jefferson county  kentucky  since the second phase of our relationship with ods is the launching of the television games network tvg  originally projected for the fourth quarter of in june  an arbitration panel approved united video satellite group  inc s proposal to acquire all of the assets of ods 
united video  which previously owned approximately of ods  has bought out the majority partners and assumed control over agreements between ods and racetracks  including churchill downs 
at this time  we cannot assess any impact of this development on our in home wagering operations

we anticipate closing on the new line of credit during the second quarter of impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year in date dependent systems 
if our computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may be unable to distinguish the year from the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations leading to a disruption of business operations 
certain of our mission critical operations are dependent upon computer systems and applications 
these systems are either directly owned and controlled by us or are provided under contract by churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations third party technology service providers 
to address the year issue  we have categorized the year issue into four principal areas 
a systems owned by the company the first area is related to systems that are owned by us 
these systems include application software and dedicated hardware that administrate our core operations 
in addition  there are numerous applications that provide administrative support and management reporting functions 
some of these applications have been developed internally and others have been purchased 
to address year compliance across this broad category of systems  we have broken each system down into its most elemental pieces in order to study the hardware including any embedded chip technology firmware  the operating systems and finally  the applications themselves 
hardware including any embedded chip technology firmware that was not year compliant has been identified and replaced as part of the routine turnover of technology capital 
hardware remaining to be replaced is scheduled for upgrading during the first half of by june  all hardware and embedded chip technology firmware owned by the company is expected to be year compliant 
all operating systems supporting specific applications have been checked by advancing the dates to determine if operating system level functionality is impacted by the date change 
as new operating system upgrades are made available and installed  periodic testing will continue to assure operating system level functionality is maintained 
in addition  we have contacted the developers of the operating systems we use and have received assurances as to their compatibility with the year transition 
application software compliance with the year has been certified through a combination of technical consultation with the software developers and testing 
applications developed with internal resources have been written with the year compliance in mind using development tools that are year compliant 
we have received assurances from third parties on year compliance for financial reporting  payroll  operations control and reporting and internal communications applications 
we require year compliance on any software upgrades 
churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations based on the schedule outlined above  we expect to be year compliant with our owned systems prior to the year the system will be tested by advancing dates to include a majority of the year critical dates by the fourth quarter of however  even though our planned modifications to internally owned hardware and software should adequately address year issues  there can be no assurance that unforeseen difficulties will not arise 
b technology services provided to the company under contract by third parties the second area is services provided to us by third parties 
many of these services are mission critical and could materially impact us should the systems upon which the services are dependent be unable to function 
the totalisator services provided by united tote are the most critical to our operations 
totalisator services include the calculation of amounts wagered and owed to winning ticket holders 
united tote developed a plan to bring all systems provided to us into year compliance during united tote and the company initiated this plan during the second quarter of by undertaking a comprehensive system hardware and software upgrade that is year compliant 
the systems were successfully installed in three phases with the last phase having been completed in october all on track  intertrack wagering and hub operations are year compliant 
we will continue to work closely with united tote to assure that future releases and upgrades are year compliant by including this provision as a condition of contracting for future services 
the video services provided by an outside vendor are also important to our operations 
video services include the capture  production and distribution of the television signal for distribution to customers located on our premises and to customers located at remote outlets throughout the nation 
we are working closely with the vendor to ensure the software applications that provide the graphical enhancements and other distinguishing features to the televised signal for churchill downs and hoosier park are year compliant 
the existing software for the graphical enhancements to the television signal is not year compliant 
we have contacted the developer of the software package directly and have received assurances that an upgrade to the software will be year compliant 
we purchased certain data and statistical information from equibase for resale to the public 
this information is an essential element of our product and is included in printed material made churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations available to our customers to assist in their wagering decisions 
equibase has implemented a year remediation plan  which is expected to be completed by the second quarter of a variety of other smaller and less critical technology service providers are involved with the company s product 
we have received assurance letters from a majority of these suppliers and will continue to work to receive assurances from those remaining 
because of the nature of our business and its dependence upon key technology services provided by third parties  we require that all new software and technology services are year compliant 
this requirement extends to include patches  upgrades and fixes to existing technology services 
in the event that any of our third party service providers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and we are unable to replace them with alternate service providers  it could result in a delay in providing our core live racing and simulcasting products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
c industry wide issues because a significant portion of our revenues are derived from customers at other racing organizations that are confronted with the same technological issues  including totalisator  video and statistical information services  we have been actively participating in an industry wide assessment and remedial efforts to address the year issue 
d feedback control systems a variety of the newer control and regulating systems are date sensitive 
environmental control systems  elevator escalator systems  fire control and security systems utilize date sensitive software embedded chip technology for correct operation 
we have systems that perform each of these functions  and are identifying if any of these systems employ technology that may not be year compliant 
we will work closely with these manufacturers to develop a remedial plan to assure year compliance if problems are identified 
churchill downs incorporated item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to date  we have incurred less than  in costs to remediate year compliance issues 
our management believes that any future costs to remediate year compliance issues will not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we are currently evaluating our most reasonably likely worst case year scenario and are also developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of our efforts to identify and correct year issues affecting our owned systems as well as issues involving third party service providers 
we intend to complete both its evaluation of a worst case year scenario and contingency planning by june  subsequent events on january   we acquired a interest in charlson broadcast technologies  llc  cbt for the purchase price of million 
cbt provides simulcast graphic software video services to racetracks and simulcast wagering facilities throughout the united states 
the purchase agreement includes provisions for an additional contingent purchase price to be paid by us to the former owners of the interest based upon the achievement of certin operating targets 
on january   we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of calder race course  inc  and tropical park  inc 
calder  from ke acquisition corp  a private holding company 
terms of the agreement include a purchase price of million subject to certain adjustments 
closing of the acquisition is expected in early april item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our major market risk exposure is primarily due to possible fluctuations in interest rates as they relate to its variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial investments for trading or speculation purposes 
as a result  we believe that our market risk exposure is not material to our financial position  liquidity or results of operations
