item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the insurance industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past several years driven by the need for  and benefits from  economies of scale and scope in providing low cost insurance 
consolidation has involved both insurance brokerages  the company s primary customers  and insurance companies  and is directly impacting the manner in which insurance products are distributed 
management believes the insurance industry will continue to experience significant changes in the next several years to meet the changing distribution model 
changes in the insurance industry may create opportunities and challenges for the company 
management believes consolidation will force brokerages to decrease distribution costs and eliminate labor intensive tasks via automation 
competition will force brokerages to increase service levels via improved automated processes such as quoting and claims processing 
management believes that the company can partner with customers to provide integrated information management solutions  and fully leverage information technology and services 
the consolidation of the industry will create a marketplace of fewer yet more sophisticated customers 
in such an environment  the company could be subject to heightened effects of competition  particularly with respect to product functionality  service and price

restructuring charges the company s product strategy is centered on a new generation of products  collectively referred to as the cd product line 
consistent with the company s product strategy  the development of enhanced versions of legacy products has been limited 
as new products are introduced to the market  existing customers utilizing legacy products are encouraged to migrate to the company s new generation of products 
during the first two quarters of fiscal the company experienced some customer attrition related to certain legacy support price increases effective in april during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to changes in the company s markets and technology trends  the product strategy was altered requiring modification of a portion of the underlying technology of cd products 
as a result of the decrease in legacy maintenance revenue and the requirement to modify a portion of the underlying technology of cd products  the recoverability of a portion of intangible assets was deemed impaired 
accordingly  during the second quarter of fiscal  the carrying value of capitalized and purchased software was reduced  and goodwill and customer lists of  were written off 
during the first two quarters of fiscal the company generated significant operating losses 
in response to the losses  the company was restructured resulting in significant reductions in payroll expense and other operating expenses 
in addition  as the company transitioned out of the hardware business  a portion of the inventory on hand was deemed obsolete 
as a result  the company incurred a restructuring charge in fiscal of liquidity and capital resources during the transition period the company achieved positive operating cash flow of  due principally to profitable operations  which were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  the company funded investments in capital expenditures of  and capitalized software of  primarily through line of credit borrowings of  despite the improved financial results during the transition period  the company is currently faced with liquidity concerns 
subsequent to january   the company received approximately million in cash related to proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock warrants 
these proceeds were used to fund operations  pay aged accounts payable and reduce borrowings under the company s bank line of credit  which was designed to provide up to million  subject to certain borrowing base limits 
the amount borrowed under the line of credit was reduced from approximately million at december  to approximately million as of march  as of april   the total amount that the bank has made available  and that the company is borrowing  under the bank line of credit is approximately million 
the company believes the amount that should be available under the terms of the line of credit is substantially higher 
based on the company s projections  the borrowing requirements of the business at certain times during will exceed million but not the higher company calculated maximum borrowing capacity under the existing line of credit 
the cash requirements are  in great part  affected by the extended payment terms offered to customers on new software sales 
in order to meet the projected cash requirements of the business  it will be necessary for the company to secure financing sources  beyond those currently available  in order to continue as a going concern 
management believes that the required financing sources to operate the business as a going concern will be secured  although there can be no assurances that such financing will be available or that it will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
as of april   management is having ongoing discussions with its bank in order to come to an agreement as to the available borrowing base under its line of credit agreement 
management believes that the borrowing base will be expanded  however  to date  no agreement has been reached  and there can be no assurance that such lender calculated maximum borrowing capacity will be adequate 
management also believes that there may be additional infusions of cash from the further exercise of outstanding stock warrants  which would supplement any cash made available through successful bank negotiations 
in late march   the expiration date of warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock at per share was extended from april  to june  finally  if the company is unable to successfully renegotiate its available borrowings under its current line of credit agreement  management will endeavor to secure the necessary financing from other sources 
such sources could include a different bank  a mezzanine lender  or an equity investor 
again  although management believes the company will be able to secure financing on terms satisfactory to the company and on a timely basis  there can be no assurances that this will happen 
management intends to aggressively seek the required financing sources that are necessary in order to continue to operate the business

these activities include research and development of software enhancements  improving usefulness  adaptation to newer software and hardware technologies  and increasing responsiveness 
product development expenditures  including amounts capitalized  were  for the nine months ended december  and  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
management believes maintenance and enhancement of product technology is critical and expects to continue to invest substantial amounts in product development

sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information established reporting standards for companies operating in more than one business segment

are not applicable to its operations 
however  the applicable enterprise wide disclosures required by sfas no 
are included elsewhere in part ii  item  note as previously reported  in october  the aicpa issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  which supersedes sop the company adopted  as required  sop for software transactions entered into beginning april  sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements ie  software products  upgrades enhancements  postcontract customer support  installation  training  etc 
to be allocated to each element based on relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence which is specific to the vendor 
the revenue allocated to software products including specified upgrades enhancements generally is recognized upon delivery of the products 
the revenue allocated to postcontract customer support generally is recognized ratably over the term of the support and revenue allocated to service elements such as training and installation generally is recognized as the services are performed 
if the company does not have evidence of the fair value of all elements in a multiple element arrangement  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such evidence exists or all elements are delivered

euro conversion effective january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union the participating countries have agreed to adopt a new common legal currency the euro 
the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies the legacy currencies and the euro 
following the introduction of the euro  the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january  and january  the transition period 
during the transition period transactions may be settled using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
conversion rates will no longer be computed directly from one legacy currency to another but rather will utilize a triangulation method specified by european union regulations whereby payments made in a legacy currency are converted to the euro and subsequently converted to the recipient s desired legacy currency 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions 
no later than july   the participating countries will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in legacy currencies such that legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions  completing the euro conversion 
the company currently has no bank accounts denominated in any legacy currency and has not entered into any material transactions denominated in any legacy currency 
the company has produced enhancements to certain software products marketed in europe to accommodate the euro conversion process the euro module 
the cost to develop the euro module was not material and will be provided at minimal cost to existing customers 
management believes the euro module allows for the continued marketing and sale of the company s products to customers requiring euro conversion capabilities 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal use computer programs and its software products that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  the inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
based on a preliminary and on going assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to replace most of its internal use financial and operational systems software and to modify certain existing products that it markets to customers  so that the software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with the conversion to new internal use software and with the planned modifications to its products  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company and or its customers 
however  if such conversions and modifications are not made  or not made on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material effect on the company and customers utilizing certain products 
the company has warranted that certain products are year compliant and that certain products will be made year compliant 
the company has been and is currently providing to customers upgrade alternatives to non year compliant versions of the company s products to its customers 
the company has outlined and continues to develop a multi faceted  comprehensive plan to address the year issue and its potential effect on the company s business 
this plan considers a company owned or licensed software for internal use  b third party provided software services used for internal use  c company proprietary software marketed to customers  d third party software embedded in the company s proprietary software marketed to customers  and e third party software marketed to customers 
additionally  the plan will address alternatives and contingencies to address the possibility of situations whereby certain aspects of the company s year efforts are delayed or otherwise unsuccessful 
internal use software the company plans to address and resolve the year issue with respect to internal financial and operational systems  such as general ledger  order management  accounts payable  billing  accounts receivable  fixed assets  time reporting and project management  by replacing substantially all of such internal use systems with vendor certified  year compliant software systems that offer enhanced features and functionality relative to the company s existing internal use software systems 
the company has purchased a year compliant system and has started the initial implementation process in march  and expects to have the system operational by the third quarter of the out of pocket software  hardware and personnel cost estimates associated with this replacement system and requisite modifications to the company s network infrastructure range from  to  the company has a financing agreement with a third party leasing company to finance the software cost of  other implementation consulting services of approximately  will be paid on a monthly basis through the implementation period  starting in april  approximately of the company s expenses are payroll related expenses 
the company relies on a third party for most of its payroll processing services 
the company has received written certification from this payroll processing vendor that the software used in its payroll processing services is year compliant 
payroll processing may be further impacted by the preparedness of various financial institutions and government agencies which receive information via electronic interface 
the company further intends to request  but has not yet requested  from certain vendors of lesser significant products and services to the company a written certification regarding year compliance 
software marketed to customers the company has used and intends to continue using both internal and external resources to re program  replace and test its proprietary software products for year compliance 
the company anticipates completing the year project as soon as practical  but in any event before any anticipated adverse impact 
the total cost of this year project is estimated to be approximately  of which approximately  has been spent to date 
this project has been and will be funded over the next year through existing cash resources and operating cash flows 
the company also plans to determine the extent to which the company s software products are vulnerable to the failure of third party products to be year compliant 
generally  software products provided by third parties that are marketed directly or indirectly by the company to its customers are developed by leading software suppliers with year programs in process 
there can be no guarantee  however  that third party software products marketed by the company will be rendered year compliant on a timely basis 
the company intends to continually monitor and evaluate year compliance through internal testing and by obtaining written certification of year compliance from the vendors 
if necessary  the company will consider alternative vendors to ensure year compliance for third party software products marketed to its customers 
while the company is not heavily reliant on non it equipment with embedded technology  the company will assess and evaluate such equipment as a part of its year efforts 
the requirements and timetable for the correction of year issues are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that may cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of trained personnel  the ability to locate and collect all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties

such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  expected or projected 
such risks and uncertainties include the company s ability to overcome its recent history of operating losses and declining revenues  the availability and amount of future sources of capital  the risks associated with future acquisitions  the willingness of independent insurance agencies to outsource their computer and other processing needs to third parties  the company s ability to continue to develop new products to effectively address market needs in an industry characterized by rapid technological change  the company s dependence on the insurance industry and in particular independent agents  the highly competitive and rapidly changing automation systems market  the company s ability to effectively protect its applications software and other proprietary information  the company s ability to attract and retain quality management  and software  technical sales and other personnel

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk delphi is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
the company has foreign subsidiaries in australia  canada  new zealand  singapore and the united kingdom uk that develop and sell software products and services in those respective countries 
the company is exposed to potential gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s primary exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the australian  canadian  new zealand and singapore dollars and the british pound 
in the transition period  the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments account  which is a component of stockholder s equity  was an unrealized loss of 
unrealized foreign currency translation income loss of  and  were recognized in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
delphi s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its debt obligations  which are primarily us dollar denominated 
the company s market risk therefore is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
as further described in note to the financial statements included herein at part ii  item  the company s debt consists primarily of a floating rate bank line of credit 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in pretax earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates on the company s debt 
if such an increase occurred  the company would incur approximately  per annum in additional interest expense based on the average debt borrowed during the nine months ended december  the company does not feel such additional expense is significant 
the company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments relating to the risk associated with changes in interest rates
