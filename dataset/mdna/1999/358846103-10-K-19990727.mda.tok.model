the company s principal services are customs brokerage  international airfreight and ocean freight forwarding and material management and distribution 
revenue for ocean and airfreight forwarding and surface transportation consolidation as an indirect carrier includes the consolidation and transportation costs eg  ocean freight costs 
revenue for customs brokerage  ocean and airfreight forwarding and surface transportation as an agent includes only the fees and commissions related to such shipments

results of operations for comparative purposes  the following tables are provided for the results of operations  for the business segments  for the years ended may   and united states operations for the year ended may  revenue customs brokerage    ocean freight forwarding    airfreight forwarding    material management and distribution    total revenue    net revenue customs brokerage    ocean freight forwarding    airfreight forwarding    material management and distribution    total net revenue    operating expenses    income from operations    long lived assets    foreign operations for the year ended may  revenue customs brokerage    ocean freight forwarding    airfreight forwarding    material management and distribution    total revenue    net revenue customs brokerage    ocean freight forwarding    airfreight forwarding    material management and distribution    total net revenue    operating expenses    income from operations    long lived assets    fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  general revenue increased to  million 
net revenue increased to million 
operating expenses increased  marginally higher than the net revenue increase 
the net gains on currency transactions dropped significantly to million from million in the prior year 
this drop was partially offset by a million increase in interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
united states operations revenue and net revenue revenue was flat for the current year but net revenue increased by 
operating expenses increased by 
customs brokerage revenue and net revenue increased 
the increase was largely due to growth in the retail and electronics industries from both new and existing customers 
most of this growth involved goods being shipped from asia  fueled by the robust american economy 
a significant portion of this growth stemmed from our existing client base reflecting a strong client retention rate 
pricing continued to be relatively stable  though slight erosions occurred in our border locations 
the number of united states customs entries filed by the company increased approximately to million from million in the prior year 
border operations  which account for almost one fifth of the total entries for the period  continue to reflect double digit growth rates driven mostly by canadian imports 
rescoping major accounts contributed to the improvement of margin 
in addition  approximately one half of the customs brokerage processing documentation has been centralized to improve the quality of the product 
ocean freight forwarding revenue and net revenue decreased and  respectively 
inbound ocean freight demand remained strong throughout in addition the company added a number of new accounts 
ocean freight rates from the far east  the company s largest trade lane  increased in the last half of the year 
conversely  ocean export activity was down significantly due to the economic situation in asia  latin america and russia 
us export orders and volume were down in all three regions 
while ocean outbound nvocc revenue from the us increased only slightly  net revenue increased by more than 
lack of growth in revenue was a direct reflection of the erosion of ocean container rates in all of the major trade lanes 
growth in net revenue was due to our ability to buy ocean container spaces  either through service contracts  or on the spot market at favorable rate levels 
airfreight forwarding revenue decreased  due to decreased volume to asia  europe and latin america and the strength of the us dollar 
however  net revenue increased by due to the use of centralized gateways to improve consolidation  cost control  and increased volume purchasing 
material management and distribution revenue and net revenue increased and  respectively 
the greatest growth was in seattle  dallas  atlanta  rochester and los angeles where new customers and increased volumes drove the increase in revenue 
in addition  the growth in revenue and net revenue was due to increased demand from existing integrated logistics customers  expansion of overseas services  expansion of warehouse facilities and the strong united states economy 
rescoping of certain customers led to an increase in revenue and margin 
operating expenses operating expenses increased 
salaries and related costs increased due to higher labor costs associated with year compliance and the company s new global transportation and financial systems  and higher medical insurance costs 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue rose to from in the prior year 
the company is committed to the reduction of operating expenses through the continuing implementation of its strategic plan  previously discussed  by focusing resources  training personnel  and emphasizing customer satisfaction 
foreign operations revenue and net revenue revenue increased by but net revenue increased only reflecting the higher costs associated with the imbalance of trade with the us the effect of translation rate changes during the period resulted in a decrease in net revenue during of approximately million 
the resultant growth rate was adversely affected by approximately percentage points 
customs brokerage revenue and net revenue decreased reflecting the large reduction in traffic going into the foreign locations from the us ocean freight forwarding revenue increased by while net revenue increased by 
the margin decrease reflected the soft european market and the resultant pressure on margins 
the company is focusing on increasing nvocc business in an attempt to improve margins 
ocean export revenue  which consists of documentation fees and commissions  was negatively impacted because lower shipping costs produce lower commissions 
air freight forwarding revenue increased by while net revenue increased  the pressure on margins again reflecting the soft european markets 
the perceived turnaround of the asian economies in the third quarter of fiscal began to improve air margins 
material management and distribution revenue increased by  however net revenue remained at prior year levels

operating expenses operating expenses increased 
salaries and related costs increased due to higher labor costs associated with year compliance and the implementation of the company s new global transportation and financial systems 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were in and in fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  general revenue increased to  million 
net revenue increased to million 
operating expenses increased  considerably lower than the net revenue increase

this increase  together with higher levels of interest income  was sufficient to offset interest expense which remained unchanged at million 
united states operations revenue and net revenue revenue increased by while net revenue increased 
operating expenses increased by 
customs brokerage revenue and net revenue increased 
the number of united states customs entries filed by the company increased approximately to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in revenue and number of united states customs entries filed was caused principally by increased canadian border activity  expansion of business with existing customers  continued nafta incentives and increased import activity from asian countries 
ocean freight forwarding revenue and net revenue increased and respectively  due to increased shipping volumes from new and existing customers 
during  management continued to expand market share  increased ocean tonnage and increased net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers 
airfreight forwarding revenue decreased by due primarily to decreased exports from the us to asia  europe and latin america and pricing pressures 
however  net revenue improved by due primarily to cost reductions achieved through the use of gateways and shipment consolidations 
material management and distribution revenue and net revenue increased and  respectively 
the greatest growth was in the united states where new customers and increased volumes led to growth in revenue in seattle  dallas  atlanta and rochester 
in addition  the growth in revenue and net revenue was due to increased demand from existing integrated logistics customers  expansion of overseas services  expansion of warehouse facilities and the strong united states economy 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  significantly less then the growth in net revenue

customs brokerage revenue and net revenue increased due to improvement of traffic going into the foreign locations from the us ocean freight forwarding revenue increased by while net revenue increased by  due to increased shipping volumes from existing and new customers  with additional products being shipped to north america and europe 
increased nvocc shipments helped to improve revenue as well as improving the margin 
the trend towards nvocc business continues at a rapid rate as certain of our customers realize the improved transit times provided by this service 
air freight forwarding revenue increased by while net revenue increased 
there was significant erosion in margin  primarily in the asia pacific area due primarily to higher airline costs  which could not be passed on to customers 
the increase in revenue came primarily in hong kong from both new and existing customers 
europe was another growth area for air freight activity 
material management and distribution revenue increased while net revenue increased by 
a significant portion of the increased revenue and net revenue resulted from the expansion of cross border trucking operations in europe 
the decrease in margin was due primarily to increased warehousing and transportation operating costs in europe 
new facilities were opened in holland and venezuela 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  significantly less than the growth in net revenue 
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to from in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents were million at may   representing a decrease from million at may  positive operational cash flow of million was used to fund capital expenditures of million resulting in free cash flow of million 
capital expenditures consisted mostly of expenditures for computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements  and warehouse equipment 
the company paid cash of million relating to acquisitions 
these payments consisted of reductions to existing debt totaling million and million for contingency payments to the sellers of previously acquired businesses and to purchase all or part of the remaining minority interest in previously acquired companies 
on march   the company entered into a million syndicated multi currency credit facility credit facility  maturing march this facility was extended to march upon its one year anniversary

the company makes significant disbursements on behalf of its customers for items such as customs duty and taxes 
billings to customers for these disbursements  which can be several times the amount of the revenue derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenue and expenses in the company s income statement 
these obligations  which greatly exceed reported revenues  are recorded as amounts due from customers and trade accounts payable 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas no 
which is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of in this filing  the company makes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of our operations  plans  events  expectations or objectives 
also  when any of the words believes  expects  anticipates or similar expressions are used the company is making forward looking statements 
many possible events or factors could affect the future financial results and performance of the company 
any of these events or factors could cause results or performance to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
these possible events or factors include the following year many computer systems  including some utilized by the company  use only two digits to represent the year in date fields 
these systems may be unable to accurately process certain data before  during  or after the year business and governmental entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures  possibly causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year yk problem 
the company is reliant on its internal computer systems and applications  located in numerous countries  to conduct its business as an international freight forwarder  customs broker and logistics provider 
the company is also reliant upon the external system capabilities of third parties  with which the company has major business relationships 
the key computer systems of the company are its transportation ocean freight  airfreight and trucking  customs brokerage  material management  communications  marketing  and financial systems 
the company has established a yk program management office to identify and resolve specific yk issues and problems 
a yk inventory  assessment  and plan of action has been completed for all of the company s global systems 
all of the company s key business systems  with minor exceptions  were yk compliant by the end of june there are several locations including singapore  indonesia  and peru that  for tactical purposes  have deferred completion dates and will be compliant on or before september  the company believes its greatest yk risk for disruption to its business is the potential noncompliance of third parties 
the company believes these third party risks are an inherent risk to the industry and are not specific to the company 
as a result  the company has contacted third parties ie vendors  governmental agencies  etc 
around the world with whom the company has material direct and indirect business relationships 
the business partners that have responded to the company s inquiries indicate that they will be yk compliant on a timely basis 
the company successfully completed year testing with the us customs service 
year efforts of customs bureaus in other countries are being monitored and are varying in scope and progress 
despite written assurances  there are no guarantees that the systems of other parties  on which the company and its competitors rely  will be compliant 
these potential interruptions may have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
total costs to replace or modify the company s business systems for yk are currently estimated to be million 
however  there can be no assurance that the costs to replace or modify the company s business systems will not exceed this estimate 
as of may   approximately million had been spent on yk efforts 
the cost estimates include  but are not limited to  the cost of internal staff and outside consultants who are working on modifying  upgrading and testing systems  the yk project management office  new or upgraded software  and various yk tools 
these costs are being expensed as incurred 
the funding of all past and future yk expenses has been  or will be paid through internally generated cash flows from operations or borrowed funds 
the costs associated with the replacement of the selected international stations operating and financial systems are not included in the above estimates 
the cost of the replacement systems are being capitalized and amortized in accordance with the company s normal accounting policies as yk compliance is an incidental benefit expected from these systems 
the primary reasons for installing these replacement systems include productivity gains  improved customer service  improved operating procedures  and controls 
the company s business may be materially affected if its systems or the systems of critical third parties are not yk compliant by january  the possible consequences of noncompliance include  among other things  the inability to provide services to certain areas of the world  delays in product delivery  invoicing errors  and possible collection difficulties 
the company may be required to shift portions of its daily operations to manual processes and thus face time delays in its operations as well as increased processing costs 
in addition  the company may not be able to provide customers with timely and pertinent information regarding their orders or shipments 
this may negatively affect customer relations and potentially lead to the loss of customers 
the company is unable to estimate the potential financial impact of these scenarios 
however  the company believes that its yk readiness program  including its contingency plans  should help to reduce material adverse effects that such disruptions may create 
as part of the company s contingency planning  it has determined that operating in a manual mode  for a limited time  is a workable alternative with the exception of its us customshouse brokerage system 
the company is currently identifying and developing specific contingency plans intended to mitigate the effects of yk disruptions 
in the event of a yk disruption resulting from the company system or other third party system failure  the company believes it will be able to provide adequate resources to successfully transition from automated systems processing to manual processing 
in addition  the company will have the ability to engage outside temporary labor 
also  the company will secure alternate carriers who are yk ready in order to continue to provide basic business services 
currency and other risk factors the company s worldwide operations are transacted in many currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  the company is exposed to inherent risks of international currency markets and governmental regulations 
the company manages these currency exposures through a variety of means such as hedging  conversion of local cash to us dollars  and accelerating and decelerating international payments among the company s offices and agents 
the company s translation adjustment and foreign exchange losses for fiscal year increased due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain currencies of asia  europe and latin america 
the charge to equity in the currency translation adjustment during was million while net foreign currency gains realized during fiscal year were approximately million 
devaluation of foreign currencies could adversely impact the financial results of operations in future periods 
the company s ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities such as airlines  steamship carriers and governmental agencies 
changes in space allotments available from carriers  governmental deregulation efforts  regulations governing the company s products  and or the international trade and tariff environment could affect the company s business in unpredictable ways 
the company routinely commits to purchasing space with carriers for expected volumes based on anticipated future demands 
the company then solicits freight from its customers to fill that committed space 
failure to utilize that space because of a downturn in the economy could have a adverse effect on operating results 
management believes the company s business has not been significantly or adversely affected by inflation in the past 
historically  the company has generally been successful in passing cost increases to its customers by means of price increases 
however  competitive marketplace conditions could impede the company s ability to pass on future cost increases to customers and could erode the company s operating margins 
additional risks and uncertainties include i the company s ability to continue its program to improve operating results and cash flows  ii dependence of the company on international trade resulting from favorable worldwide economic conditions  iii dependence of the company on continued services of key executives and managers  iv risks associated with the company s acquisition strategy  including a diversion of management s attention to assimilation of operations and personnel of acquired companies  b potential adverse short term effects of acquisitions on the company s operating results  and c integration of financial reporting systems and acquired assets 
v the possible inability of the company s information systems to keep pace with the increasing complexity and growth of the company s business and yk issues  vi the increasing level of investment required by the transition of the company from prior predominance of customs brokerage revenue to an increasing emphasis on integrated logistics and providing a full range of international transportation and supply chain management services  vii other risks disclosed elsewhere in this form k or in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the company is continuing its comprehensive review of its pricing structure of its various services and customer credit terms 
the company is also continuing to review its expenses to improve the quality and efficiencies of the company s processes 
item a quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks relate primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and short term interest rates 
financial derivatives are employed to manage these risks in certain countries under certain circumstances 
under no circumstances are financial derivatives utilized for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign exchange sensitivity the company maintains worldwide operations and transacts business in many currencies other than the us dollar 
because the company s foreign subsidiaries are typically local currency functional entities  the company is exposed to transactional and translational gains and losses as relative currency values fluctuate 
as a result  the company s consolidated cash flow and net income are subject to variations due to changes in exchange rates 
the company manages its currency risks through a variety of means  such as employing financial derivatives  converting local cash to us dollars  and accelerating and decelerating payments among the company s offices and agents 
financial derivatives typically take the form of forward foreign exchange contracts  though options are occasionally purchased to hedge certain transactions 
as of may   the company had forward contracts outstanding of million equivalent value and had no option contracts 
a change in value of the us dollar relative to the underlying currency of these forward contracts would have an immaterial effect on the company s earnings 
the company s earnings are sensitive to changes in foreign exchange rates due to the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities 
these balance sheet items  denominated in non functional currency include cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt 
the table below provides the us dollar equivalent of these balances summarized as assets and liabilities and shows the sensitivity of the net exposure to a change in value of the functional currency relative to the non functional currency 
amounts in millions gain loss if functional currency non functional cash a p appreciates depreciates currency a r debt net exposure us dollar chinese renminbi uk pound german mark belgian franc japanese yen french franc finnish mark other interest rate sensitivity the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its cash and short term investments and its debt obligations 
the company currently does not employ any financial derivatives to manage the risk associated with its cash investments 
it does however  currently employ a swap to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
at may  the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  subject to variable  short term interest rates 
on the same date  the company had debt obligations of million  of which million was subject to variable  short term interest rate risk
