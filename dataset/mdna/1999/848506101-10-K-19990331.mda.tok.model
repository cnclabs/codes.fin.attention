we work directly with a wide range of suppliers to evaluate the latest developments in pc related technology and engage in extensive testing to optimize the compatibility and speed of the components which are sold and integrated into trinology pcs 
we have also developed visual communications technology 
in connection with our reorganization in march  we licensed this technology to algo vision schweiz 
to date  we have received limited royalty income from sales of products by also vision schweiz incorporating this technology 
we may also offer products incorporating our visual communications technology manufactured by the entities in which we own a minority interest  in our pcs and as an additional product line for sale to our customers

however  we have no commitments or arrangements to obtain any additional funds and we cannot predict whether additional funds will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we cannot obtain funds when required  the growth of our business may be adversely affected 
escrow shares we contemplate that in the event the  shares held in escrow are released from escrow because the specified targets are met  we will incur a substantial non cash compensation charge to operations  based on the then fair market value of these shares 
such charge could substantially increase our loss or reduce or eliminate our net income  if any  for financial reporting purposes for the period during which shares are or become probable of being released from escrow 
although the amount of compensation expense recognized by us will not affect our total stockholders equity  it may depress the market price of our securities 
our minimum revenues  as defined in our escrow agreement  for the years ended december  and were less than the targeted million  and  accordingly  the  escrow shares were not released 
the escrow shares may also be released if our stock price reaches certain targets 
the escrow shares are not included in our calculation of our per share loss 
see risk factors we will record charges to operations in the event shares of our stock are released from escrow 
year compliance the year issue is the result of using only the last two digits to indicate the year in computer hardware and software programs and embedded technology such as micro controllers 
as a result  these programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if uncorrected  such programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause computer system failure or miscalculations and could disrupt our operations and adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations 
we recognize the importance of the year issue and have established a project team with the objective to ensure an uninterrupted transition to the year by assessing  testing and modifying products and information technology and non it systems so that such systems and software will perform as intended and information and dates can be processed with expected results 
the scope of the year compliance effort includes i it such as software and hardware  ii non it systems or embedded technology  and iii the readiness of key third parties  including suppliers and customers  and the electronic date interchange with those key third parties 
independent of the year issue  we are in the process of installing new financial accounting  procurement  order management and invoicing systems 
these systems are expected to be fully operational by the second quarter of and be year compliant 
testing of these systems to become compliant for year has begun and should be fully completed by the end of the second quarter of if such compliance is not achieved  we have developed a contingency plan which includes increasing normal inventories of critical supplies prior to december  and ensuring that all critical staff are available or scheduled to work prior to  during and immediately after december third parties 
in addition to internal year it and non it remediation activities  we are in contact with key suppliers and vendors to minimize disruptions in the relationship between us and these important third parties from the year issue 
we have requested year compliance certification from each of such vendors and suppliers for their hardware and software products and for their internal business applications and processes 
while we cannot guarantee compliance by third parties  we will consider alternate sources of supply  which we believe are generally available in the event a key supplier cannot demonstrate its systems or products are year compliant 
our products 
we believe that all hardware products included in trinology pcs shipped since the fourth quarter of are year compliant and hardware products included in trinology pcs shipped prior to such time can be made year compliant through upgrade of software patches 
we have requested year compliance certificates from each of our suppliers and vendors from parts and components installed in our trinology pcs 
the replacement of our existing financial accounting  procurement  order management and invoicing systems are estimated at  however  only a portion of the cost of these systems is attributable to the year issue 
while we estimate that the year effort will have a nominal cost impact  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate cost of the year effort or the total cost of information systems 
such costs will be expensed as incurred  except to the extent such costs are incurred for the purchase or lease of capital equipment 
our current estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to remediate and test our computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
the estimates were made using assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  year modification plans  implementation success by key third parties  and other factors 
new developments may occur that could affect our estimates of the amount of time and costs needed to modify and test our it and non it systems for year compliance 
these developments include  but are not limited to i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to locate and correct all relevant date sensitive codes in both it and non it systems  iii unanticipated failures in our it and non it systems  and iv the planning and year compliance success that suppliers and vendors attain 
we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on the current estimate of probable costs of making our products and it and non it systems year compliant 
accordingly  we are not able to estimate our possible future costs beyond the current estimate of costs 
as new developments occur  these cost estimates may be revised to reflect the impact of these developments on the costs to us of making our products and it and non it systems year compliant 
such revisions in costs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the quarterly period in which they are recorded 
although we consider it unlikely  such revisions could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
like virtually every company  we are at risk for the failure of major infrastructure providers to adequately address potential year problems 
we are highly dependent on a variety of public and private infrastructure providers to conduct our business in numerous jurisdictions throughout the country 
failures of the banking system  basic utility providers  telecommunication providers and other services  as a result of year problems  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business 
while we are cognizant of these risks  a complete assessment of all such risks is beyond the scope of our year assessment or our ability to address 
we have focused our resources and attention on the most immediate and controllable year risks
