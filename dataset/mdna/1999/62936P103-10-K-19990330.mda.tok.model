item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview substantially all of our resources are devoted to our research and development programs 
to date  we have not completed development of any pharmaceutical product for sale 
we have incurred cumulative losses through december  of million  net of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue to expand our research and development activities and our preclinical and clinical testing activities 
substantially all revenues are derived from license fees  milestone payments  and research and development support payments from licensees and these revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  we expect that income or loss will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  that the fluctuations may be substantial  and that results from prior quarters may not be indicative of future operating results 
profitability will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensees  to complete product development  to obtain the required regulatory approvals  and to manufacture and market products 
we cannot assure that these events will occur 
results of operations most of our revenues of million in  million in  and million in  were derived from research and license agreements 
we recognized revenue from these agreements as follows 
under our agreement with smithkline beecham we recognized million in  million in  and million in  
under our agreement with kirin we recognized million in  million in  and million in  and 
under our agreement with amgen we recognized  in and  and million in these revenues were derived from a combination of one time license fees  milestone payments and research and development support payments and are not indicative of future revenue that may be earned under these agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of payments that may be received in the future under these agreements 
research and development expenses increased to million in  from million in  and million in the increases in research and development expenses were principally due to commencement of clinical trials for nps in mid and the commencement of clinical trials for nps in mid we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future if we conduct increasingly expensive later stage clinical trials and if we start clinical trials for new product candidates 
general and administrative expenses increased over the three years with expenses of million in  million in  and million in we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase modestly in the future as necessary to support research and development activities 
interest income and gain on the sale of marketable investment securities were million in  million in  and million in the increase in was primarily due to a higher average cash balance resulting from the net proceeds of the follow on offering of nps common stock in may we anticipate that interest income will decrease in the future as cash is utilized for operations 
income tax expense of  in and  in resulted from a japanese tax withheld on the license fee and milestone payments by kirin  and from united states alternative minimum tax of  incurred on net income in and paid in any future milestone and royalty payments from kirin will be subject to the same tax 
as of december   we had a federal income tax net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a federal income tax research credit carryforward of approximately million 
our ability to utilize these operating loss and research credit carryforwards against future taxable income will be subject to annual limitations in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations since inception primarily through collaborative research and license agreements and the private and public placement of equity securities 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative revenues from research and license agreements and million in consideration for the sale of equity securities for cash and services 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities which totaled million at december  we receive quarterly research and or development support payments under our agreements with amgen  kirin  and smithkline beecham 
the payments are scheduled to aggregate million through the scheduled expiration dates of the agreements  respectively  in december  june  and october in addition  smithkline beecham will purchase  shares of nps common stock on november   at a premium to the market price  if the research agreement is not terminated early 
we could receive future payments of up to million in the aggregate from amgen  kirin  and smithkline beecham upon the accomplishment of specified research and or development milestones under the respective agreements 
however  we do not control the subject matter  timing  or resources applied by our licensees under their respective development programs 
thus  potential receipt of milestone payments from these licensees is largely beyond our control 
progress under these agreements is subject to risk and each of these agreements may be terminated before its scheduled expiration date by the respective licensee 
we cannot assure that our licensees will make any future payments  whether as research or development milestone payments or support payments 
we have entered into sponsored research and license agreements that obligate us to make research support payments to academic and or commercial research institutions 
additional payments may be required upon the accomplishment of research milestones by the institutions  or as license fees or royalties to maintain the licenses 
as of december   we had a total commitment of approximately million for future research support payments 
we expect to enter into additional sponsored research and license agreements in the future 
as of december   our investment in leasehold improvements  equipment  and furnishings was million  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
additional equipment and facilities may be needed if we increase our internal research and development activities  a portion of which may be financed with debt or leases 
we expect that our existing capital resources  including interest earned thereon  and expected research and development support payments and equity purchases from licensees  will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least months 
however  actual needs are dependent on numerous factors  including our progress toward developing and commercializing products 
furthermore  in the event we in license or otherwise acquire a product candidate  substantial expenditures for developing and commercializing the product candidate would be required 
in addition  if any licensee terminates its agreement  we might not have sufficient capital to complete the development and commercialization of a product in the respective territory 
a reduction in the expected amount of research and development support payments or equity purchases may shorten the period during which we could maintain our operations or require us to reduce operations 
it may also become necessary to raise additional funds to support our development and commercialization programs 
we are presently seeking additional funding for certain current programs through corporate collaborations and licensing agreements 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financing which could be dilutive to current shareholders 
we cannot assure that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may modify plans for some of our research and development programs 
year assessment we continue to assess impact of the year on our operations and systems 
we have developed assessment procedures and a plan to address identified issues 
a yk task force was assembled in the beginning of to evaluate the potential impact of the so called year millennium bug on our operations 
since formation  the task force has monitored the evaluation of financial  accounting  information managements  scientific equipment  and building systems 
to date financial  accounting  and information management systems review has been completed 
those systems which were not compliant have been replaced 
we continue to assess the impact of the year on our other systems and equipment 
we expect to have identified and replaced or updated all internal systems and equipment which are not year compliant before the year to the extent necessary to enable us to continue operations 
we do not expect the cost of repair or replacement to be material to our operations 
we are also seeking assurance from primary third party service and goods suppliers  including financial institutions  suppliers  cros and other collaborative parties that they do not expect the year matter to materially impact their dealings with us 
to date  we are not aware of any critical third party suppliers that will not be able to meet our needs in order to maintain operations 
we cannot assure that these third parties are using systems that are year compliant or will address any year issues in a timely fashion 
any year compliance problems of our suppliers  clinical research organizations  or our licensees could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
certain business risks we are currently in the early stage of product development 
nps  nps  and compounds for the treatment of hpt are the only product candidates in clinical development by us or our licensees 
there is no guarantee that nps  nps  or any compound for hpt will prove to be safe or effective or that back up or later generation compounds will be identified or taken into clinical trials or if so identified and so tested  that the compounds will be found to be safe  effective  or marketable 
all of our remaining technologies are in preclinical stages and will require significant additional research and development efforts before any commercial use 
because we have granted exclusive development  commercialization  and marketing rights in the fields of hpt and osteoporosis  the success of these programs is primarily dependent upon the efforts of amgen  kirin  and smithkline beecham 
other business risks include our lack of product sales  a history of operating losses  the uncertainty of regulatory approvals  rapid technological change and competition  the uncertainty of protection of our patents and proprietary technology  our dependence on third parties for manufacturing  future capital needs and the uncertainty of additional funding  our lack of marketing capabilities  the uncertainty of third party reimbursement  the uncertainty of in licensing efforts  our dependence on key personnel and our ability to manage growth 
a more detailed discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements is contained in item  business risk factors
