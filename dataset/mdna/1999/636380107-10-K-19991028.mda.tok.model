accredited s new computer system is year compliant

however  there is no guarantee that the company s expected results will be achieved 
in addition  actual results could differ materially from those expected results 
the company depends on receipt of payment for services from its payor sources  most of which utilize computer software to process those payments 
the company s primary payors include medicare and medicaid programs  insurance companies  other certified home health agencies and long term health care provider programs 
the company has begun formal communications with its significant payors to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those payors failures to remediate their own year issues 
the company is currently unable to predict what effect  if any  the year issue may have on the computer systems of those payors or  in turn  on the company
