the company believes it is approximately complete with phase based on all currently identified tasks 
phase test execution 
in the test execution phase  the company will verify that all related development and test preparations are completed 
the company will fully test each partition or deployment entity  including bridges and data conversions

phase is being conducted as phases to progress 
status 
as part of an enterprise wide process  the company has begun integrating resorts to a common platform 
the company is replacing a substantial portion of its existing information systems with a fully integrated enterprise information system 
a vendor has warranted the company s financial portion of this system to be year compliant 
the company has been reviewing and will continue to review its financial and operating systems at each of its offices and resort locations 
the assessment  testing and resolution phases of the project are being performed concurrently 
as each mission critical system is tested  the remediation  upgrade  or replacement if needed is begun 
the company currently has found that four of its priority applications are year compliant based on the vendor representation or through testing by the company 
two priority applications are currently being remediated and the remaining ten applications are in the process of being tested 
it is the company s goal to have the project completed for mission critical systems by the fourth quarter of based upon the analyses conducted to date  the company believes the mission critical systems at the company s offices and resort locations are either currently compliant or will be compliant by the fourth quarter of costs 
the company has prepared a preliminary estimate of costs with regard to making its mission critical systems year compliant 
at this time  the company s preliminary estimate of such is approximately million 
the company incurred approximately million in and expects to incur an additional million in in costs associated with year issues 
the company expects that expenditures relating these issues will be funded from operating cash flows 
the preliminary estimate of costs includes administrative expenses  testing  and hardware  software and facility replacement costs 
the company will capitalize and depreciate the cost of any hardware  software and facility replacement cost over the expected useful life of the assets 
the company is expensing as incurred all costs related to software modification  as well as all costs associated with the company s administration of the project 
the preceding discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this k 
the preceding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain forward looking statements  which include the company s growth and expansion plans  financing plans  future prospects and other forecasts and statements of expectations 
actual results might differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements due to  among other things  factors related to the timing and terms the company s new product development  mortgages receivable financing  integration of acquired properties and companies  future acquisitions and those factors identified in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including those set forth in this k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company s total revenues denominated in a currency other than us dollars for the year ended december  primarily revenues derived from the united kingdom and japan were approximately of total revenues 
the company s net assets maintained in a functional currency other than us dollars at december  primarily assets located in western europe and japan were approximately of total net assets 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has not historically been significant to the company s operations or net assets 
interest rate risks as of december   the company had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
the floating interest rates are based upon the prevailing libor rate or the prevailing prime interest rate for the company s senior credit facility and endpaper debt  respectively 
in addition  the company sold million of mortgages receivable through its conduit facility 
the gain on sale recognized by the company is based upon the prevailing commercial paper rates 
for floating rate debt  interest rate changes do not generally effect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes do effect the market value of debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical one percentage change in the prevailing libor  prime or commercial paper rate would impact after tax earnings of the company by less than million per year 
a similar change in the interest rate would impact the total fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  excluding the convertible notes  by approximately million 
the conversion feature to common stock makes it impractical to estimate the effect of a change in interest rates on the company s convertible notes 
there is a high correlation between the fair value of the convertible notes and the company s common stock
