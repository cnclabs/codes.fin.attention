year issue general as the year approaches  concerns arise involving business interruptions or failures of specific operations performed by computer chips as a result of date sensitive information 
the problem results because some current information technology it systems and non it systems with embedded computer chips are not prepared to recognize the year change from to absent remediation of non compliant systems  there is a substantial risk to oggi of business interruption or failure 
therefore  it is important to prepare a contingency plan to insure that all affected areas within oggi have been reviewed 
project oggi developed an enterprise wide year readiness initiative program to identify the enterprise wide business impact s of the arrival of the year a plan was developed to ensure all applicable systems  equipment  vendors and external agents are compliant 
oggi has utilized the recommendations from an outside consultant as a tool for project management 
in the process of identifying assets affected by the year problem  a year representative was selected from each department within oggi 
each representative completed an inventory of year affected assets utilized by their department 
the inventory included infrastructure  including non it assets such as elevators and security systems  applications software  third party suppliers and customers external agents 
the representatives prioritized assets by assigning a criticality factor 
these factors consisted of fatal  critical  marginal and desirable 
fatal is defined as an asset that is necessary for uninterrupted operations of oggi and will fail or terminate if there were year date processing errors 
critical is defined as an asset that is necessary for the operation of the business  and year related failures will produce an inaccurate or incorrect result 
marginal is defined as an asset that is necessary for the operation of the business  but year related failures will cause minor inconveniences  annoyances  or irritations 
desirable is defined as an asset that is not mandatory for operating the business 
all assets will continue to be evaluated to determine whether they need to be replaced  repaired or are compliant 
as of december  oggi has evaluated the majority of assets and confirms all assessment work is substantially completed 
oggi s most fatal asset is older personal computers 
oggi has developed a plan to ensure these systems will be compliant by the first quarter of information regarding bios upgrades and recommendations have been received from the manufacturers of each of the different computer systems that are not year compliant 
the software programs identified as not yet compliant continue to be reviewed and remediation will be implemented according to manufacturer recommendations 
some of the computer software programs currently being utilized will be replaced by compliant systems 
vendors and external agents also have been contacted by phone and or letter to request information regarding their year status 
oggi has received some responses to date but all vendors have not yet responded 
alternative vendors have been identified for those vendors that do not respond 
in addition  a process also was established for reviewing new and existing contracts and maintenance agreements for appropriate year compliance language 
costs oggi presently expects that substantially all future costs associated with the year compliance will be internal and are estimated to be less than  costs incurred to date have been approximately  contingency plans although oggi expects to finish testing its year compliance by june   it has considered contingencies in case any of its fatal or critical assets  not already confirmed as compliant  fail year compliance testing 
for such assets  oggi has identified alternatives that will not cause significant interruptions to service or operation 
policy coverage many experts now believe that the year problem may have a material adverse impact on the national and global economies 
in addition  it seems likely that if businesses are materially damaged as a result of the year problems  at least some such businesses may attempt to recoup their losses by claiming coverage under various types of insurance policies 
and  although management has concluded that under a fair reading of the various policies of insurance issued by it  no coverage for year problems should be considered to exist and has included exclusionary language on certain policies beginning in  it is not possible to predict whether or to what extent any such coverage could ultimately be found to exist by courts in the various jurisdictions 
accordingly  important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the inability of oggi to accurately estimate the impact of the year problem on the insurance issued by  or other business operations of oggi 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in the management s discussion and analysis and other statements made throughout this report constitute forward looking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 
such forward forwarding statements involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in or contemplated by the statements 
these assumptions  risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those associated with factors affecting the property casualty insurance industry generally  including price competition  size and frequency of claims  escalating damage awards  natural disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and general business conditions  oggi s dependence on investment income  the geographic concentration of oggi s business in the northeast united states  the adequacy of oggi s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses  government regulation of the insurance industry and the other risks and uncertainties discussed or indicated in all documents filed by oggi with the securities and exchange commission 
oggi expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the release of this report 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments a significant portion of the oggi s assets and liabilities are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
oggi s primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk on fixed rate domestic medium term instruments and  to a lesser extent  domestic short and long term instruments 
oggi has established strategies  asset quality standards  asset allocations and other relevant criteria for its portfolio to manage its exposure to market risk 
in addition  maturities are structured after projecting liability cash flows with actuarial models 
oggi currently has only one derivative instrument outstanding  an interest rate swap on its long term debt  which is used as a hedge 
all of oggi s financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
oggi s portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers other than us treasury and agency obligations  industry segments or geographic regions see notes and to oggi s consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
caution should be used in evaluating the oggi s overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are excluded in the hypothetical effects insurance liabilities represent of total liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses represent of total assets 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of financial instruments as of december   excluding insurance liabilities  reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses  and fixed income securities that are classified as held to maturity because such assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value  would have been as follows if interest rates had decreased by basis points  there would have been no significant change in the fair value of oggi s long term debt or the related swap agreement 
the change in fair values was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using models that measure the change in net present values arising from selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates had increased by basis points  there would have been an approximate million net decrease in the fair value of oggi s investment portfolio 
the change in fair value was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
if the market prices of all equity securities decreased  there would have been an approximate million decrease in the fair value of oggi s investment portfolio 
common equity securities at december  include million which are managed under the value style investment management approach and million which are managed under a growth style investment approach 
preferred equity securities at december  consist primarily of convertibles
