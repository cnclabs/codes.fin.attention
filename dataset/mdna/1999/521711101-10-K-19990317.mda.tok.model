item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements concerning the company s anticipated performance including future revenues  costs  and profits  or about the development of the company s markets  made throughout this annual report  may be deemed forward looking statements 
such statements are based on the current assumptions of dataware management  which are believed to be reasonable 
however  they are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the important factors described under certain factors that may affect future results below and in exhibit to this annual report which is incorporated herein by reference that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
overview in general dataware s revenues are composed of software license fees and service revenues 
the overall gross margin of the company fluctuates depending upon the mix of business among these categories of revenues 
since its inception  dataware has generated significant revenues outside of north america 
until the ihs transaction described below  dataware had international direct sales organizations in germany  the united kingdom  italy  france  sweden  denmark  australia  singapore  and canada 
as of december   the company has direct sales organizations in the united kingdom  denmark and singapore and has distribution agreements covering other european countries  the pacific rim  and south america 
the company s sales from operations outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
the company s foreign subsidiaries are principally engaged in software sales  customer service and distribution activities 
relationship with ihs on september   dataware sold a portion of its data services business to information handling services group  inc ihs in exchange for cash and the stock of ihs s subsidiary  creative multimedia corporation 
the portion of the business sold included certain contracts and other assets of dataware  as well as the stock of the company s australian  canadian  german  italian and swedish subsidiaries 
the activities of the data services business sold consisted of processing customer text and data and using it to create information distribution products 
the company also entered into a distribution agreement with ihs on september   under which ihs took over the software distribution activities formerly performed by the five divested foreign subsidiaries primarily involving the company s legacy products 
in addition  the company has entered into agreements with ihs under which it provides software and multimedia services for use by ihs internally and in its publishing activities  and ihs provides software that the company incorporates into certain of its products 
these agreements may be periodically reviewed and revised according to the circumstances of the parties 
since the ihs transaction  the company has focused more on its software and multimedia businesses and less on providing services 
as dataware s largest distributor  ihs accounted for of software license revenues of total revenues during the company s plan is that  as revenues from the existing ihs arrangements diminish during and thereafter due to the winding down of the current agreements  they will be replaced by increasing revenues from sales of the company s newer products through ihs and other channels 
however  the current ihs relationship will remain important for the near term and any unexpected disruption would likely have a material adverse effect on dataware 
results of operations as compared to revenues the company s total revenues decreased from million in to million in this decline was primarily due to the reduction in services revenues following the sale of a portion of the services business to ihs in software license fees remained relatively flat at million in and million in software license fees include revenues from systems and tools  applications and custom software products 
the mix within the software revenues continued to favor the company s legacy products in  although the newer knowledge management suite and dataware ii publisher products gained momentum 
management anticipates that revenues from the legacy products will continue to diminish through  both in absolute terms and compared with total software license revenue 
software license revenue in included million related to agreements with ihs 
as part of the ongoing relationship  the company and ihs amended existing agreements during the third quarter of to provide for ihs to make guaranteed minimum payments called for by those agreements  at the discretion of the company  on an accelerated  discounted basis 
software revenues in the second half of include million of such discounted payments accelerated from the years and service revenues decreased to million in from million in  a million decrease 
service revenues are primarily derived from ledge multimedia development  production services  software maintenance  custom software development and project management 
the decrease in service revenue reflects the impact of the ihs transaction 
in the past  recurring revenue has been a significant portion of total revenues  comprising approximately  and of total revenues for  and  respectively 
recurring software license revenues result from annual renewal of retrieval licenses and certain other fees 
recurring service revenues have historically resulted from data services to support customers in their use of dataware software products  database hosting and software maintenance fees 
the decrease in recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenues from to was primarily due to the impact of the ihs transaction 
although the company has not yet experienced a material reduction in orders as a result of the economic turmoil in asia or  more recently  brazil  persistent weakness in capital spending in those regions may have a negative impact on revenues 
cost of revenues the total cost of revenues in was million or lower than costs of million in as a percent of total revenues  total cost of revenues was of revenues in  as compared to of revenues in this decrease is primarily caused by the sale of a portion of the lower margin services business to ihs in the company recorded a 
million one time charge in the fourth quarter of for the write down of abandoned software assets to their estimated net realizable value 
excluding the effect of this one time charge  cost of software licenses represented of software license revenue in  down from in this decrease is a result of reduced fixed costs due to a lower portion of third party software sales in the mix and  thus  lower third party license fee payments 
cost of services decreased to of service revenue in from in cost of services consists primarily of personnel expenses  certain overhead costs and the cost of third party services 
the decrease is caused by the transfer of a portion of the lower margin services business to ihs as well as increases in services fees charged by the company s remaining services business 
gross profit total gross profit was million  down from million in  representing of total revenues in and in excluding the one time charge mentioned previously  total gross profit was relatively flat in absolute terms from year to year and represented of revenues in compared with in the increase in gross margins is primarily due to the transfer of a portion of the lower margin services business to ihs 
gross margins may continue to improve in the long run if the company continues to increase the percentage of software revenues in the product mix  and attains additional improvements in services margins 
however  there are a number of important factors that could adversely affect the company s future gross margins  resulting in higher than anticipated costs and or lower than anticipated revenues 
these factors include the existence of strong competition for the company s products and services  including the introduction of new products from competitors  the timing of which cannot be foreseen by the company  the inherent risks of new product introductions  including uncertainty of customer acceptance  the impact of higher levels of services that the company provides to support its new software products  unanticipated costs of integrating acquired companies  increased employment costs stemming from the high level of competition for qualified personnel in the software industry  and the company s reliance on third parties for supply of certain product components 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily caused by the ihs transaction  which divested the company of certain business activities in the us and us  as well as five foreign subsidiaries that had been principally involved in distributing dataware products 
this decrease in costs was partially offset by the company s increased marketing activities during related to the rollout of new products 
product development expenses product development expenses excluding capitalized software expenditures decreased to million in from million in product development expense as a percentage of total revenue remained flat at in and the decrease in product development expenses in terms of dollars is due to expenses related to northern light technology corporation  a subsidiary whose assets were sold on april  these expenses amounted to million in product development expenses other than those related to northern light technology corporation remained flat at million in and in the company capitalized approximately million of internally developed software costs as compared with million in the company also capitalized approximately million of application development tool software that was purchased during the company s expenditures in research and development  including capitalized internally developed software costs  were million and million for the years ended december  and  representing and of revenues  respectively

there were no such non recurring charges recorded in purchased in process research and development on january   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of green book international corporation gbook  in exchange for approximately  in cash  which is being paid over a one year period 
the company incurred direct expenses of  related to the transaction 
prior to the acquisition  gbook was the developer of a software package for the electronic publishing of financial prospectuses 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of gbook are included in the financial statements from the acquisition date 
the results of the continuing operations of gbook are immaterial in the context of the results of the company 
although the company acquired of the stock of gbook  its intention was not to carry on the operations of gbook as a going concern 
rather  the company s objective in the transaction was to acquire control over the technology underlying gbook s electronic file compression and viewing software viewer technology and its object oriented electronic authoring system authoring technology 
the company s intention was to use the acquired viewer technology to sell services and software to the company s existing and future clients for distributing relatively large  secure and searchable electronic publications that are  by nature of their small size  uniquely able to be distributed on a single floppy diskette or over the internet with commercially viable download times 
during  the company incorporated the authoring technology into a product that allows customers to author publications in house  rather than relying on the company as a service provider 
because the technology acquired was incomplete and substantial additional development effort by the company was required before the viewing and authoring technology could be incorporated into future products and services  the company recorded a charge of  for purchased in process r d in the first quarter of the purchased technology was incomplete because the company needed to make substantial modifications to change user interfaces  fix software bugs  enhance features and integrate the software into the company s future products and services 
the underlying technology had no alternative future use  inasmuch as the company did not plan to commercialize the technology in its existing form  had no other product  service or research and development project in which the technology could be utilized  and did not intend to market the technology as a stand alone product without significant further development 
the company successfully completed the further development necessary to complete the required technology during the cost of completing the development effort was in line with management s estimates at the time that the technology was purchased 
the product began shipping in june of other income expense  net during the company reported approximately  of net interest income as compared with approximately  in net interest expense in the change resulted from increases in the average balances of cash and investments beginning with the ihs transaction in september of as well as the decrease in interest expense related to the company s lines of credit that was incurred during other expense  net  amounting to  in and  in consists primarily of foreign exchange losses caused by the effect of changes in exchange rates on intercompany balances with the company s foreign subsidiaries

as required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 management of the company has evaluated its ability to realize its deferred tax assets  which are comprised principally of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a full valuation allowance of million to offset the entire net deferred tax assets because it was unlikely whether it would be able to realize the assets due to large cumulative pretax losses during the prior three years 
accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been fully reserved 
management re evaluates the issue on a quarterly basis and determined that no net adjustment was necessary in or as compared to revenues the company s total revenues decreased slightly to million in from million in software license fees increased to million in from million in  a million increase 
software license revenue growth in was primarily due to million in software revenues under the new agreements with ihs 
service revenues decreased to million in from million in  a million decrease 
the decrease in service revenue reflected the company s continuing shift away from the provision of services  and towards increased sales of software products 
this shift was furthered by the agreement with ihs  under which a portion of the data services business was sold 
cost of revenues the total cost of revenues in was million or lower than costs of million in as a percent of total revenues  total cost of revenues was of revenues in  as compared to of revenues in this decrease was largely due to a million one time charge that was recorded in the second quarter of for the write down of less productive software assets to their net realizable value 
a continuing shift away from the higher cost services business also contributed to the decrease 
excluding the effect of the million one time charge referred to above  cost of software licenses represented of software license revenue in  down from in the primary reason for this decrease in costs was the increase in software license fees as fixed expenses decreased 
the decrease in fixed costs was in large part related to the completion of a contractual royalty commitment with a third party in the second quarter of cost of services represented of service revenue in both and gross profit total gross profit was million  up from million in  representing of total revenues in and in in addition to the one time charge mentioned previously  the increase in total gross profit from year to year was due to lower costs within each revenue category and a shift in product mix to higher margin software products from relatively lower margin services

there were no such non recurring charges recorded in charge for purchased in process research and development in conjunction with the acquisitions of status iq ltd 
in march and ntergaid  inc in july  the company acquired certain technologies under development that the company hoped would prove valuable to the future growth of the company 
purchased research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was valued using a risk adjusted cash flow model  under which future cash flows were discounted taking into account risks related to existing and future markets and an assessment of the life expectancy of the purchased software 
expected future cash flows associated with in process research and development were discounted considering risks and uncertainties related to the viability of  and potential changes in  future target markets and to the completion of the products that would ultimately be marketed by the company 
such technology  valued at approximately million for status iq and 
million for ntergaid  was charged to operations during the first and third quarters of  respectively  as purchased in process research and development

at december   the company had a net operating loss carryforward of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
operating activities provided million of the company s cash during days sales outstanding  based on revenues for each calendar quarter  ranged from days to days during days sales outstanding were days during the fourth quarter of the significant reduction in days sales outstanding during was primarily due to the collection of large amounts due from certain customers  as well as payments made under the distribution and licensing agreements with ihs  in the quarter ended december  although the company has been focusing on decreasing its days sales outstanding  it anticipates that these levels of days sales outstanding will increase going forward 
the company s investing activities used cash of million during  consisting of million for additions to property and equipment  
million for the acquisition of gbook

the company did not make any purchases during the fourth quarter of  however  it may make further repurchases from time to time in the open market or in private transactions  as market conditions warrant 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated cash from operations  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  working capital and other capital requirements may change because of unanticipated changes in business conditions or delays in market acceptance of new products  in addition to such other considerations as expansion of operations or research and development activities  competitive and technological developments  costs of remediation of year computer problems  and possible future acquisitions of businesses and or product rights 
there can be no assurance that the company may not experience liquidity problems because of adverse market conditions or other unfavorable events 
the company has experienced slowdowns in collection of receivables from certain asian and brazilian distributors  apparently as a result of the regions general economic problems 
while the company cannot predict the long term effect  it is reasonable to assume that there will be an adverse impact on the company s business as long as the general economic problems persist 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which addresses software revenue recognition as it applies to certain multiple element arrangements 
sop also amends sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  to extend the deferral of application of certain passages of sop through fiscal years beginning on or before march  all other provisions of sop are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  the company will comply with the requirements of this sop as they become effective and does not expect that its revenues and earnings will be materially affected 
certain factors that may affect future results year the year problem refers to the operational failures that are expected to arise in computer systems  microprocessors  and software that are not able to properly interpret and sort dates beyond the year the company recognizes that the year problem may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations if its products and systems are not year compliant or if those of its principal suppliers and or customers are not year compliant 
the company has initiated a comprehensive program to try to assess this potential effect and to remediate it where possible 
there can be no assurance  however  that the program will be successful 
the extent of the impact on the company if such problems cannot be assessed or remediated is not fully known 
the company intends to minimize this uncertainty through the efforts described below 
the company s current  updated product offerings were developed to accurately store  sort  display  process  provide  and or receive data including th and st century dates when used properly and in conformity with the product information furnished by the company  provided that there was no hard coding of dates to force a prefix of during the production process and that all other technology used in combination with the dataware product properly exchanges date data with the dataware product 
although the company does intend to do further testing on these products including third party software incorporated in the products  it does not expect to undertake significant further research and development efforts in this regard 
the company has not reevaluated all prior versions of the company s products 
however  customers currently on maintenance will have been upgraded to a year compliant product by the year the company does not believe that it has any warranty obligation to users of older products that may be non compliant with respect to any possible failure of such products to be year compliant or that it is legally responsible for costs incurred by such customers in ensuring their compliance 
the company provides services through a variety of computer systems  including servers for web hosting 
the company has begun a review of the year compliance of these systems and expects that it will be completed by mid to the extent the untested systems are not year compliant  the company expects to undertake to correct the problems  which may require acquiring new equipment 
however  there may be a material adverse impact on the company s service revenues if these efforts cannot be completed in time 
the company is using internal resources as well as third parties to test  reprogram or replace its internal use systems 
internal use systems include those for information  communication  accounting  and payroll functions  as well as those used for product development and customer service 
they include both information technology systems that rely on software  as well as those that contain embedded microprocessors 
because the evaluation of its products  services and internal systems is not complete  the company does not yet know the total cost of this effort 
accordingly  it is possible that the cost could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
any such costs will be funded through operating cash flows and will be expensed as incurred 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of such changes 
furthermore  this does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims  nor the cost of internal hardware or software replaced in the ordinary course of business and not accelerated for year compliance purposes 
because the company has not yet identified any significant year issues in its systems  it has not formed a contingency plan to address any such issues 
the failure to develop and implement a contingency plan  if in fact needed  could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company is reviewing all major suppliers to determine the status and schedule for their year compliance  since their noncompliance may have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
the review may include  where feasible  obtaining warranties of compliance for products and services and will include testing where appropriate 
the company s review of major suppliers is anticipated to be complete by mid to the extent that its review shows that a particular supplier s situation poses unacceptable risks to the company  the company plans to identify an alternate source by september  the company plans to request information on the year compliance of its principal customers 
the potential for an adverse impact on dataware from customers year problems ranges from the failure of dataware products when used in conjunction with other customer systems to the possibility that a customer will itself be so severely impacted by the year problem that it will be unable to provide the company the level of revenues as in the past 
it should be noted that the company s customers are in many cases publishers and distributors  so the level of business they do with dataware may depend in large part on the situation with their respective customers 
since the company is continuously marketing to new customers  its customer review cannot be complete as of any particular date 
to the extent that the foregoing statements involve predictions  estimates  contingencies  or assumptions  they are forward looking statements and there are various important factors  including but not limited to those described above and in this paragraph  that could cause actual circumstances and results to differ materially from those described in these statements 
with respect to the company s own products and services  the statements are subject to the adequacy of the company s review of its products and warranties 
unanticipated factors  including but not limited to problems with customer systems other than those tested for and adverse legal interpretations  could cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from these statements 
with respect to systems for internal use or delivering services  the statements are subject among other things to the adequacy of the company s testing procedures and assurances of third parties 
in evaluating such systems  as well as the year readiness of suppliers and customers  the company must rely on information provided to it by third parties about such parties year readiness 
it is impossible for the company to verify the testing or other bases for such information 
it should also be noted that systems in use by governmental and private entities in the national infrastructure in the united states and each other country in which the company does business including but not limited to power  communications  and transportation systems  over which the company has no control and as to which it cannot practically obtain reassurance  may suffer year problems that materially affect the company s business and results of operations 
other factors exhibit hereto contains additional information about important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from those contemplated by any forward looking statements in this annual report 
that information is incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and trade accounts receivable is immaterial
