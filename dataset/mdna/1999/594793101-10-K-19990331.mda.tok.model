item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance standard analog integrated circuits 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the communications  computer and industrial markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
with the company s acquisition of synergy semiconductor in november  the company broadened its standard product offerings to include high speed mixed signal and digital integrated circuits 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
while the company continues to maintain a long term strategy that focuses on standard products sales  the company has recently increased its emphasis on custom and foundry product sales as an interim response to the asian financial situation 
for   and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  competitive pricing pressures and the company s ability to meet increasing demand 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative purchased in process technology total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net revenues 
net revenues increased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million in due to higher standard product revenues and higher custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  computer peripheral ic components  drivers  and switching regulators 
such products were sold to manufacturers of portable computing  computing peripherals  telecommunications and industrial products 
during the company increased its emphasis on custom and foundry product sales as an interim response to the asian financial situation 
custom and foundry revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for the company believes that pricing pressures continue to be experienced by the general technology sector and by companies in the analog segment of the semiconductor industry 
during  standard product customer demand continued to be short term focused due to shorter than historical order lead times 
these factors affect the company s ability to predict future sales growth  profitability and forward visibility 
the company s ability to predict demand in future quarters also continues to be affected by the trend of its customers to place orders close to desired shipment dates and to reduce their long term purchasing commitments  which is the result of less predictable demand for such customers products and increased product availability in the semiconductor industry 
the company has sought to address these reduced order lead times by implementing faster production cycles and increasing inventory levels as a percent of revenues 
net revenues increased approximately to million for the year ended december  from million in principally due to higher standard product revenues  which grew to of net revenues from in sales of standard products were led by the increased sales of low dropout regulators  computer peripheral ic components  mos drivers  and switching regulators 
such products were sold to manufacturers of portable computing  computing peripherals  telecommunications and industrial products 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease during in international sales as a percentage of net revenues resulted from the change in product mix emphasizing custom and foundry product sales as an interim response to the asian financial situation 
the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic  canadian and certain other international distributors until such distributors resell the company s products to their customers 
generally  sales to international distributors are recognized upon shipment 
the company estimates returns and provides an allowance as revenue is recognized 
gross profit 
gross margin is affected by the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the write off  in the fourth quarter  of approximately million in excess inventory in response to a reduced sales forecast for synergy products and a decline in average selling prices  which were offset in part  by an management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued increase in manufacturing efficiency resulting from greater capacity utilization 
the company s gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin reflects an increase in manufacturing efficiency resulting from greater capacity utilization 
manufacturing yields  which affect gross margin  may from time to time decline because the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
factors such as minute impurities and difficulties in the fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
there can be no assurance that the company in general will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of standard products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
the company s research and development expenses increased approximately million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with the company s conversion to six inch wafer fabrication  and increased expenses due to engineering staffing  design services  and prototype wafers to support the development of new standard products 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new standard products is critical to its future success and expects that research and development expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future 
the company s research and development expenses increased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased costs associated with the company s conversion to six inch wafer fabrication  and increased expenses due to engineering staffing  design services  and prototype wafers to support the development of new standard products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for while decreasing on a percentage basis to in from of net revenues in the dollar increase was due  in part  to increased wages and salaries  higher commissions  advertising and other sales and administrative expenses associated with the growth of the company s revenues 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase on a dollar basis in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis to approximately million for the year ended december  from million for while decreasing on a percentage basis to in from of net revenues in the dollar increase was due  in part  to higher commissions  advertising and other sales and administrative expenses associated with the growth of the company s standard products revenues 
purchased in process technology 
on november   the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of synergy semiconductor for a cash purchase price of million  transaction fees of million  direct merger costs of approximately  and the assumption of liabilities of approximately million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the total purchase cost was allocated to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued intangible assets 
of that amount  approximately million was allocated to purchased in process technology  which has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use  for which the company recorded a one time charge in the year ended december  the amount of the one time charge was derived from a valuation based on the securities and exchange commission guidance issued in a september  letter to the american institute of certified public accountants 
the purchased in process technology related to approximately individual development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and  therefore  the successful completion of such projects was uncertain 
those development projects correspond to three existing product lines supercom  clockworks and logic 
at the time of the acquisition  further development remained on these projects and the estimated costs to complete were approximately million 
management has not determined whether any product resulting from these projects will become available for sale in fiscal and  therefore  no assurances can be given as to when revenues from these projects will commence 
while the company perceives a future benefit related to completion of these projects  it believes that the failure to reach successful completion would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
significant assumptions used to determine the value of in process technology included i forecast of net cash flows that were expected to result from the development effort  ii an estimate of percentage complete for each project which ranged from to with an average for all projects of  iii a discount rate of approximately 
other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities offset by interest incurred on line of credit borrowings and term notes 
other income  net increased by approximately  to million in from  in such increase reflected a  increase in interest income due to an increase in average cash and investment balances  partially offset by an increase in interest expense by  due to an increase in the average amount of notes payable 
the company expects to continue to utilize term financing as appropriate to finance its capital equipment needs 
other income  net increased by approximately  to  in from  in such increase reflected a  increase in interest income due to an increase in average cash and investment balances and decrease in interest expense by  due to a reduction in the average amount of notes payable 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was million  which represents of income before tax excluding the million one time charge for purchased in process technology  which is a non deductible charge for federal income tax purposes 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was million or 
the income tax provision differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes and the non deductible charge for purchased in process technology offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
for the year ended december  the provision for taxes on income was million or of income before provision for income taxes compared to million or for the income tax provision differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes offset by the benefit from the foreign sales corporation  federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of cash and short term investments of million and borrowing facilities consisting of i million under a revolving line of credit  of which all was unused and available  and ii million under a non revolving line of credit  under which there was million outstanding at december  the two lines of credit are covered by the same loan and security agreement 
this agreement expires on september   subject to automatic renewal on a month to month basis thereafter unless terminated by either party upon days notice 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the non revolving bank line of credit that is covered by the loan agreement described above  can be used to fund purchases of capital equipment whereby the company may borrow up to of the cost 
amounts borrowed under this credit line are automatically converted to four year installment notes 
all equipment notes are collateralized by the equipment purchased  and bear interest rates of  at the company s election  a fixed rate based on the four year us treasury bill rate at december  plus or an annual adjustable rate based on the one year us treasury bill rate at december  plus 
during  the company borrowed million under the non revolving line of credit  which was converted to a four year installment note at a fixed rate of 
under a previous non revolving bank line of credit  the company borrowed million in  which was converted to four year installment notes bearing interest at the bank s prime rate at december  in november  in connection with the acquisition of synergy semiconductor  the company assumed million in short term bank debt and million in long term installment notes 
shortly thereafter  in all of the assumed short term debt was repaid and million of the long term installment notes was repaid 
the remaining unpaid long term debt consists of four year installment notes  collateralized by equipment purchased by synergy prior to the acquisition  and bears fixed interest rates ranging from to 
the company s working capital increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  deferred income taxes of million  accounts receivable of million and increases in inventories of million which was partially offset by increases in accounts payable of million  current portion of long term debt of million  income taxes payable of million  deferred income of million  other accrued liabilities of million and accrued compensation of million 
the company s short term investments were principally invested in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
the company s cash flows from operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income after deducting non cash activities  to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year and to a million decrease in inventories  million tax benefit from employee stock transactions combined with million increase in income taxes payable  and a million increase in accounts payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales 
the company s cash flows from operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in net income after deducting non cash activities  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period and to a million decrease in inventory combined with a million tax benefit from employee stock transactions  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s investing activities in the year ended december  used cash of million compared to million for the increase in cash used by investing activities reflects the acquisition cost of synergy semiconductor  net of cash acquired  of million and an incremental million increase in equipment purchases and leasehold improvements primarily relating to the six inch wafer fabrication operation for the year ended december  offset in part by million in net additional maturities of short term investments 
financing activities for the year ended december  provided cash of approximately million as compared to million of cash provided in financing activities for this increase was the result of million in additional long term borrowings and an increase of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options in as compared to  offset in part by a million increase in repayments of short term and long term debt during the same periods 
the company currently intends to spend up to approximately million during the next twelve months primarily for the purchase of additional wafer and test manufacturing equipment and leasehold improvements 
the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its existing credit facilities 
factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  statements regarding the levels of international sales  statements regarding future expenditures  statements regarding year compliance costs  and statements regarding current or future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below 
the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  and economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic conditions in asia or elsewhere 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition or results of operations 
historically  the company has not experienced significant individual product gross margin differences on export sales compared to domestic sales 
however  as a result of the foregoing international market risks or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material gross margin fluctuations in the future  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in november  the company acquired synergy semiconductor  which is its first major acquisition 
it is not certain that the company will be able to successfully integrate into its operations synergy s business  products  technology or personnel 
the company s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  competitive pricing pressures  the company s ability to meet increasing demand  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  the company s access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is transitioning its business to rely more heavily on the sale of standard products 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will continue to depend upon standard products sales 
as compared with the custom and foundry products business  the standard products business is characterized by shorter product lifecycles  greater pricing pressures  larger competitors and more rapid technological change 
generally  the standard products market is a rapidly changing market in which the company faces the risk that  as the market changes  its product offerings will become obsolete 
the company competes in the standard products market with established companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to compete successfully in the standard products market or that it will be able to successfully introduce new standard products in the future 
the failure of the company to compete successfully in the standard products business would materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in the analog market include product features  performance  price  timing of product introductions  emergence of new computer standards  quality and customer support 
because the standard products market for integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in its various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
due to the increasing demands for integrated circuits  the company expects intensified competition from existing integrated circuit suppliers and the entry of new competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 
there can be no management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assurance that these existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company s future success depends in part upon its intellectual property  including patents  trade secrets  know how and continuing technology innovation 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
there can be no assurance that any patent owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that any of the company s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate the company s technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
readiness disclosure for year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company has initiated a year project designed to identify and assess the risks associated with its information systems  products  operations and infrastructure  suppliers and customers that are not year compliant  and to develop  implement and test remediation and contingency plans to mitigate these risks 
the company is replacing or upgrading systems  equipment and facilities that are known to be year non compliant 
for the year non compliance issues identified to date  management believes the cost of upgrade or remediation will not exceed  which is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
if implementation of replacement systems is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
information systems 
a review of the company s information systems has been completed and the company has initiated the work necessary for the existing systems to become year compliant 
testing of all information systems will be conducted throughout the company is also actively reviewing its hardware and systems infrastructure  such as networks  in order to ensure that they are year compliant 
based on the current status of the assessments and remediation plans made to date  and as the costs incurred to date have not been material  the company does not expect total year related costs pertaining to its information systems and hardware and systems infrastructure to be material 
products 
the company has assessed the capabilities of its products sold to customers and has not identified any problems related to year compliance 
the company believes its current products are year compliant  however  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving third party products  the company may see an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
in addition  litigation against the company regarding year compliance issues may occur in the future 
for these reasons  the impact of customer claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
operations and infrastructure 
machinery and equipment and other items used in the operations and facilities of the company have been inventoried and are currently being assessed for year compliance 
the assessment to date management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued has not uncovered any material issues 
suppliers 
the company is in the process of contacting its critical suppliers to determine whether their operations  products and services are year compliant 
where practicable  the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of suppliers to be year compliant 
in the event that suppliers are not year compliant  the company will seek alternative sources of supplies 
however  such failures remain a possibility and could have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
customers 
the company is actively responding to all customer requests for compliance  surveys and other general information related to its year programs 
the company will also request assurance from its key customers that they  and their products which incorporate the company s products  are year compliant 
general 
the company does not currently expect its costs associated with the year problem to be material  and expects to be able to fund these costs through operating cash flows 
however  the company has not yet completed its assessments  developed remediation plans for all problems  developed contingency plans  or completely implemented or tested any of its remediation plans 
the risks associated with the year problem can be difficult to identify and to address  and could result in material adverse consequences to the company 
even if the company  in a timely manner  completes all of its assessments  identifies and tests remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation or contingency plans in a timely manner  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations and become material 
in many cases  the company is relying on assurances from suppliers and customers that new and upgraded information systems and other products will be year compliant 
the company plans to test certain third party products  but cannot be sure that its tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed by the supplier in a timely and satisfactory way 
because the company uses a variety of information systems and has additional systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  the company cannot be sure that all of its systems will work together in a year compliant fashion 
furthermore  the company cannot be sure that it will not suffer business interruptions  either because of its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible for them to fulfill their commitments to the company 
if the company fails to satisfactorily resolve year issues related to its products in a timely manner  it could be exposed to liability to third parties 
the company has not developed a worst case scenario with respect to year issues  but instead has focused its resources on identifying material  remediable problems and reducing uncertainties generally  through the year project described above 
if the company or the third parties with which it has relationships were to cease or not successfully complete its or their year remediation efforts  the company would encounter disruptions to its business that could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial position and results of operations 
the company could be materially and adversely impacted by widespread economic or financial market disruption or by year computer system failures at third parties with which it has relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company held million in short term investments consisting of corporate debt securities commercial paper and repurchase agreements with a financial institution with maturities of less than one management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on short term investments 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of this debt 
the company does not hedge any interest rate exposures
