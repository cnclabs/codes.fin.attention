the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was attributable to the decrease in sales in multimedia chipsets  which traditionally have higher gross margin than board products  and a million write down of inventories 
for the company s board level products  video streaming products generally have higher margin than dvd products 
consequently  changes in the product mix of sales could significantly affect the company s gross margin

liquidity and capital resources the company had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million at january   compared with million at january  the primary sources of cash in fiscal came from million net of expenses proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock series b and c 
the primary uses of cash included million used by operations  and million used to repurchase all outstanding shares of series a and b preferred stock 
as of january   the company had million outstanding under a million bank revolving line of credit that expires in october and is collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that have been assigned to the lender 
the company also has a million bank line of credit available that expires in october  and is collateralized by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  equipment  and intangibles 
this asset based line of credit had an outstanding balance of million as of january  under the existing loan agreement  the company is subject to certain financial covenants  including a net income covenant 
since july  the company has  on occasion  been in violation of the net income covenant and has obtained waivers releasing the company from obligation to meet this covenant 
the company was granted such a waiver for the quarter ended january  the company may need such waivers for future periods  and there is no assurance such waivers will be granted by the lender 
the company may become in default in the future under the current loan agreement with its lender if it does not meet this covenant and the company does not obtain waivers 
during fiscal  the company issued  shares of series b and  shares of series c convertible preferred stock at  par value per share through private placements 
proceeds from the sale of preferred stock were used for general corporate purposes 
as of january   no shares of series a and b preferred stock were outstanding 
the company s primary sources of funds to date have been to date have been cash generated from operations  proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
the company believes that its current reserve of cash and equivalents and short term investments and the availability of funds under its existing asset based banking arrangements will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve month period  the company believes that to the extent it does not generate cash from operations  it may have to raise additional capital through either public or private offerings of its common stock or preferred stock or from additional bank financing 
there is no assurance that such capital or bank financing will be available to the company 
factors affecting future operating results the company s annual and quarterly results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the technology embodied in the company s products generally and the company s products in particular  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in the company s products generally and the company s products in particular and or those of the company s competitors  gains or losses of significant customers  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which may occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials  the company s inability to protect its intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  rampup  and manufacture of products causing shipping delays  and availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain of the company s products 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from sales to the asia pacific region  a region of the world that is subject to increased economic instability 
there can be no assurance that such instability will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international sales 
any adverse change in the foregoing or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends of future periods 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfall until late in a fiscal quarter  which could result in even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
further  the company operates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in volatility of the company s common stock price 
impact of the year issue the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company has tested its products and believes its products are year compliant 
our management has also conducted a review of our exposure to the year problem  including working with computer systems and software vendors 
the company currently believes that our internal systems are year compliant 
the company does not expect to further incur any significant operating expenses or invest in additional computer systems to resolve issues relating to the year problem  with respect to both its information technology and product and service functions 
however  significant uncertainty remains concerning the effects of the year problem  including uncertainty regarding assurances made by vendors 
in addition  the company has not investigated year compliance of other entities that are not its vendors or that are vendors or purchasers of its product 
for example  the company does not have control over the compliance of its distributors  partners  banks  stock markets or systems in which its products are used 
the company cannot assume that third parties will be year compliant  and if they are not  the company cannot assume that it will not be subject to actions  liabilities or damages associated with these failures 
the company will develop appropriate contingency plans in the event that a significant exposure arises relative to any such third parties 
recently issued accounting standards in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging accounting  was issued which defines derivatives  requires all derivatives be carried at fair value  and provides for hedging accounting when certain conditions are met 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal year beginning after june  although the company has not fully assessed the implications of this new statement  the company does not believe adoption of this statement will have an material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company faces exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact its operations and financial condition 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at january   the company held million in short term investments consisting of us government and corporate debt securities with an average original maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at january   the fair market value of the short term investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
the company generally expects to have the ability to hold its investments until maturity and therefore would not expect operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates for short term investments 
at january   the company had  outstanding under a  variable interest rate bank line of credit and  outstanding under a  variable interest rate bank line of credit 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on the company net income and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the hong kong dollar is the financial currency in the company s subsidiary in hong kong 
the company does not currently enter into foreign exchange forward looking contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  the company does maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
