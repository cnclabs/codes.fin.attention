the company continues to make sales to the retirement community market  which is made up of retirees from the north who move to florida to enjoy its milder winters and who typically purchase homes to be located on sites leased from park communities that offer a variety of amenities

the company has a product line of approximately active models 
market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short term basis  however  the manufacturing process is such that the company can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market 
during fiscal  the company s product mix was positively affected by the special edition homes marketed by prestige and by larger  more expensive multi wide homes resulting from greater consumer confidence and the availability of varied types of financing at competitive rates 
many family buyers today purchase three  four or five bedroom manufactured homes  compared with the two bedroom home that typically appeals to the retirement community market 
during fiscal  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with st century mortgage corporation to provide mortgage financing to retail customers who purchase the company s manufactured homes at prestige retail sales centers 
this joint venture  which originates and services loans  has given the company more control over the financing aspect of the retail home sales process and allowed the company to offer better service to its retail customers

forward looking statements certain statements in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  there are risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  competitive pricing pressures at both the wholesale and retail levels  changes in market demand  adverse weather conditions that reduce sales at retail centers  the risk of manufacturing plant shutdowns due to storms or other factors  and the impact of marketing and cost management programs 
year issue many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
as the century date change occurs  these programs may recognize the year as  or not at all 
if not corrected  many computer systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year the year issue 
the company has developed plans to address its possible exposures related to the impact of the year issue on its operations 
these plans are expected to be implemented primarily with the use of internal resources 
the company has assessed i the equipment in its manufacturing operations that contains microprocessors or relies on software  and ii the company s internal systems 
the company has determined that its manufacturing equipment does not have a year issue 
the company s internal systems consist of its central operating and accounting systems  which handle the majority of its business transactions 
the company has completed an assessment of its central operating and accounting systems which resulted in the identification of certain modifications necessary to bring these systems into year compliance 
these modifications have been made  primarily through the purchase of updated hardware and updated vendor supplied software 
based on the results of initial testing with respect to these systems  the company does not anticipate that the year issue will materially impact operations or operating results 
management believes that total pretax costs incurred to date in connection with the year issue have not materially impacted the company s operating results and that future costs of compliance likewise will not be material 
the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address the year issue and that its risk factors are primarily those that it cannot directly control  including the readiness of its major suppliers  customers and service providers 
failure on the part of these entities to timely remediate their year issue could result in disruptions in the company s supply of materials  disruptions in its customers ability to conduct business and interruptions to the company s daily operations 
management believes that its exposure to third party risk may be minimized to some extent because it does not rely significantly on any one supplier or customer 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems and operations relied on by such third parties will be corrected on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
due to the nature of the company s manufacturing and retail operations  including the fact that the materials used by the company in its manufactured homes are widely available  the company does not currently have formal contingency plans or a timetable for implementing them 
the company s suppliers typically maintain a one month supply of materials 
contingency plans will be established  if they are deemed necessary  after the company has adequately assessed the impact on its operations should third parties fail to properly remediate their computer systems 
contingency plans would include such items as identifying alternative suppliers and increasing inventory levels prior to the year to ensure availability of supplies for the company s manufacturing and retail operations
