includes residuals  prepaid wireless airtime  repair income and extended service contracts 
electronic parts  accessories and specialty equipment  the largest product category of radioshack s retail sales mix  decreased percentage points in when compared to  despite a increase in dollar sales 
this decrease as a percent of retail sales was primarily due to the communications and services categories becoming a higher percent of the product mix in the communications category increased to of retail sales from in dollar sales of the category increased over last year 
this category  which includes wireless communications such as cellular and pcs telephones  as well as residential telephones  answering machines  pagers and other related telephony products  continues to benefit from the sprint store at radioshack launched in september this store within a store concept provides customers with access to a full service communications center that offers  where available  sprint local and long distance telephone service  spree sm prepaid phone cards and sprint branded residential telephones 
additionally  radioshack earns commissions from cellular carriers for activating customers with cellular services 
sales of communication products are expected to continue to grow in sales of audio and video products declined to of retail sales in from of retail sales in  primarily due to the overall shift in the product mix to communications and services 
sales dollars were flat from the prior year  due in part to radioshack s limited selection of name brand products 
radioshack plans to announce a strategic alliance with a well recognized audio and video manufacturer in the second quarter of  which management believes should improve sales in this category

aggressive pricing strategies put into place as radioshack transitioned from ibm to compaq branded computers and products during the first six months of and general selling price declines in the personal computer industry contributed to this decline 
management believes that the downward trend in selling prices of personal computers will continue in  but to a lesser extent than seen in despite this downward trend  radioshack believes that the higher unit sales volumes of personal computers will contribute to increased sales of higher gross margin products and services  such as accessories and extended service plans  as well as to increased customer traffic to the store 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  radioshack launched the compaq built for you program which enables consumers to custom configure personal computers at their nearby radioshack store with convenient direct shipment to their home  office or nearby radioshack store 
sales in the services and other category  which includes residuals  prepaid wireless airtime  repair income and extended service contracts  increased in in dollars and as a percent of radioshack retail sales  due to an increase in residual income received from radioshack s third party providers of communication and direct to home satellite products and services  as well as to a large increase in sales of prepaid wireless airtime

residuals vary by service provider  but are typically a portion of the continuing service revenue throughout the ensuing months and or years of that customer s subscription 
in  radioshack earned approximately million of residual income  compared to million in residual income is expected to continue to increase in  however  increases are dependent upon such factors as customers continued usage of certain services and stability of average revenue per subscriber  among other factors 
prepaid wireless airtime sales are expected to continue to increase in computer city segment computer city s overall sales decreased to  million in from  due to the sale of this subsidiary to compusa on august  for the eight months ended august   sales of personal computers decreased in dollars due to a reduction of approximately in the average selling price of desktop and notebook computers from the same period in additionally  both overall and comparable stores sales were negatively impacted by the announced sale of computer city to compusa on june   at which time computer city took promotional mark downs to sell both its third party and private label inventory in preparation for the sale to compusa

radioshack s gross profit increased in dollars for the year ended december  versus  but decreased as a percentage of radioshack s total sales by percentage points over the same period

additionally   put options have been sold in at strike prices ranging from to  these put options have six month maturity dates 
put options will continue to be sold by the company from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions  including maturities  depend on market conditions  the company s liquidity and other considerations 
the company s primary source of short term debt consists of short term seasonal bank debt and commercial paper  which have maturities of less than days 
in the second quarter of  tandy replaced its existing million credit facilities with new credit facilities  also totaling million 
the new facilities were granted by a syndicate of banks  including a new agent bank  and consist of a million day revolving credit facility maturing june and a million five year revolving credit facility maturing june the revolving credit facilities are used as backup for the commercial paper program and may also be utilized for general corporate purposes 
annual commitment fees for the facilities are of the million facility per annum and of the million facility per annum  whether used or unused 
tandy plans to extend the million facility to june the total debt to capitalization ratio was at december   at december  and at december  these increases in the debt to capitalization ratios in and resulted primarily from a reduction in tandy s stockholders equity due to the share repurchase program and the impact of divested businesses

year readiness disclosure the company s management recognizes the need to take action to reach its goal that its operations and relationships with key vendors  service providers  customers and other third parties will not be adversely impacted by software processing errors arising from calculations using the year and beyond 
like many companies  a significant number of tandy s computer applications and systems require modifications in order for these systems to be ready for the year all statements made and referred to here are year readiness disclosures under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the company s state of readiness tandy is using a combination of internal and external resources to identify  assess  remediate and test its many different information technology it systems such as point of sale  payroll  credit  purchase ordering  merchandise distribution  management reporting  manufacturing  mainframe  and client server applications  as well as its non it systems eg heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems  building security systems  etc since beginning the project in  the company has completed identifying and assessing of its internal mid range and mainframe it applications and approximately of its data communication and telecommunication systems for year readiness 
an inventory and assessment of the company s workstations  which includes desktop and notebook computers  will be completed in the second quarter of as of december   remediation and unit testing was approximately complete for mid range and mainframe applications 
unit testing ensures the accuracy of the programming changes to the code 
for data communication and telecommunication systems  remediation and unit testing was approximately complete as of december  and is expected to be complete by september  remediation and testing to determine if all of the company s mission critical systems will interface and operate effectively to process data containing dates subsequent to january  for all remaining servers  systems software and personal computers are expected to be completed by the third quarter of third party software systems  including financial systems  point of sale and manufacturing have been or will be implemented during the vendors of these third party software packages have stated that they are year ready  however  the company has and or intends to conduct its own testing in with respect to non it system issues  the company is in the process of identifying  assessing and remediating  if necessary  its building and process and production control systems for any year issues relating to the operations of its facilities 
identification and assessment of security access  building control systems and elevators in the buildings which serve as the company s corporate headquarters have been completed and remediation was approximately complete at december  the company is in the process of identifying and assessing year issues of its remote locations  such as its distribution centers  manufacturing plants  and administrative offices and does not expect any significant issues to arise from this process 
all of the company s non it systems are expected to be year ready by the third quarter of although unforeseen circumstances may arise  the year remediation program is presently on schedule 
the company will continue communicating with its key suppliers  utilities  financial institutions  customers and others to determine their state of year readiness  to coordinate year conversions where appropriate and to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable 
costs in management s opinion  the financial impact of being year ready is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management anticipates that total expenditures associated with the year internal modifications will range from million to million  which has been and will continue to be funded from operating cash flow 
as of december  approximately million representing internal payroll and related benefits  depreciation expense  machine time and incentive bonuses  among other costs  has been spent on these internal modifications 
an additional million has been paid to external parties for consulting and professional fees 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  all these costs are expensed as incurred 
combined  internal and external costs related to the year project account for approximately of the company s annual it budget 
additionally  the company has purchased and is installing third party financial software packages and related hardware totaling approximately million to million in light of the year issue 
these purchases are in addition to other capital investments made in the normal course of business for certain third party software systems and applications which address the ongoing retail and operational needs of the company 
the risks of the company s year issues with respect to the risks associated with its it and non it systems  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that some of the company s store operating and inventory management systems could fail in one or more geographic areas of the united states 
the consequence of such failure could include the inability of those affected radioshack stores to electronically record sales transactions 
this could further result in a breakdown in the company s supply chain as the company relies on electronic information to replenish its stores 
such an occurrence would result in a loss of revenue  however  it is not possible to quantify the possible range of such loss 
there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties on which the company s systems rely will be converted timely and that the systems will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems or ongoing operations 
however  concerning the risks associated with third parties  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that some of the company s merchandise vendors will not be compliant and will have difficulty filling and distributing orders 
failure of one or more third party service providers on whom the company relies to address year issues could also result  in a worst case scenario  in some business interruption 
the lost revenues  if any  resulting from such failures would depend on the time period in which the failure goes uncorrected and on how widespread the impact was 
the company is also in the process of assessing the implications of possible year related claims regarding products it has manufactured or sold  or is currently manufacturing or selling 
the outcomes of any year claims and the impact of such claims cannot be determined at this time  such outcomes will depend on the facts and circumstances of each situation and an evolving state of law as these types of claims are addressed by legal systems in the united states and worldwide 
the company has limited the scope of its risk assessment to those factors upon which it can reasonably be expected to have an influence 
for example  the company has made the assumption that financial institutions and the federal reserve system as well as most utility companies and national telecommunications providers will continue to operate 
obviously  the lack of such services could have a material effect on the company s ability to operate  but the company has little  if any  ability to influence such an outcome  or to reasonably make alternative arrangements in advance for such services in the event they are unavailable 
contingency plans the company has completed a prioritization of year issues in order to develop and document year contingency plans 
the company has identified its critical applications to be its merchandising and inventory systems  which include purchasing  receiving and distribution and store replenishment  its point of sale store operating system as well as its financial systems  which includes payroll  accounts payable and receivable and banking and other financial applications 
should any or all of the critical applications fail to perform properly subsequent to january   the company will resort to temporary manual processing for recording sales  ordering product and replenishing the company s stores  which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on its operations in the short term 
management anticipates having a formal documented contingency plan to deal with this scenario by november the company s eleven distribution centers are located in various geographic areas of the united states 
should one or more of these distribution centers fail to operate due to regional power outages or other unforeseen circumstances  the company s other distribution centers which may be operating could replenish stores typically serviced by those distribution centers for a relatively short period of time 
management is in the process of documenting this contingency plan 
although no single internal or third party supplier accounts for a material portion of the company s sales and operating revenues  management is evaluating the need for a formal list of alternative suppliers should some existing suppliers be unable to provide product beyond the end of calendar year should the decision be made that such a list and agreements with alternate suppliers be necessary  they will be developed prior to november all statements concerning year issues other than historical statements  including  without limitation  estimated costs and the projected timetable of year compliance  constitute forward looking statements  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading factors that may affect future results
