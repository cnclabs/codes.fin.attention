results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales were  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or over the year ended december  in  us sales and sales outside the us increased and  respectively  over the increase in us sales was fueled primarily by the growth of the us sales force in the number of sales agents and more productive sales territories 
outside the us  the economic environment that currently exists in asia is affecting sales 
however  sales to the japanese market rebounded substantially in the fourth quarter with the addition of new distribution which is experienced in the orthopedic market 
sales of reconstructive products increased to  in  led by the foundation r total knee  hip and shoulder systems 
trauma product sales have remained relatively flat 
the increase in reconstructive products is attributed primarily to the expansion of the us sales force 
continued transition from a non exclusive to an exclusive sales force is a major factor for the flat sales of trauma products 
the company anticipates sales for trauma products to increase as the transition to an exclusive sales force is completed and the product base is expanded 
going forward  rapid geographical expansion and introduction of new products will fuel additional increases in sales in both the total joint and trauma segments of the business 
gross margin increased to  in  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales for gross margin as a percent of sales decreased slightly due to discounts and higher costs associated with the initial production of the revelation tm and linear r hip systems 
it is anticipated that future production costs of the new hip systems will decrease as volumes increase and production methods are made more efficient 
research and development expenses increased by  or in when compared to the same period in research and development activities increased to complete the design of two new hip stems and two acetabular systems that were released in early the company effectively balanced the increased activity at the beginning of the year with expenditures in the remainder of the year to control expenses relative to sales by the end of current activities include a joint design effort with norton desmarquest fine ceramics to develop a ceramic knee femoral component to address the issue of polyethylene wear in the knee

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  in when compared to the same period in this increase was due to additional instrumentation depreciation and continual investment in the development of the us sales infrastructure  increase in commission and royalty expenses in conjunction with the increase in sales  costs associated with unsuccessful acquisition attempts and a charge for inventory discrepancies at consigned locations 
going forward  consigned inventory discrepancies are not expected to have a material impact due to improvements in the internal control process and additional training 
due to factors such as commissions and royalties and additional instrumentation depreciation  selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as the company supports new product introductions and expands into new territories  but should decrease as an overall percent of net sales 
however  the company is expecting to manage operating expense growth relative to sales and gross margin levels going forward 
operating income increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to increased gross margins  which was partially offset by increased operating expenses 
going forward  operating income should increase due to leveraging fixed costs and increased sales volume 
interest expense decreased by  in compared to this was primarily related to the existence of million in term debt in the first five months of  which was paid off as of the end of may in addition  the decrease in interest expense was affected by both a higher effective interest rate and the amortization of the related debt discount in the prior year

capital expenditures encore has spent a significant amount of its resources over the past several years on building a state of the art  fully integrated orthopedic implant company 
these expenditures have included the investment in surgical instrumentation  machine tools to increase manufacturing capacity  computer hardware and software  and equipment required to support a growing organization 
over the last two years  encore has acquired machine tools primarily through capital leases 
encore has made significant investments in surgical instrumentation as such instrumentation is necessary to implant encore reconstructive products 
also  the size of the sales force and the increases in the product lines have necessitated increases in the need for additional surgical instruments 
in the united states  these instruments are capitalized and depreciated 
they are loaned to the sales force without charge to aid in sales 
internationally  these instruments are sold to the distributors at cost 
the amounts of surgical instruments capitalized in  and were   and  respectively 
other capital expenditures during those periods were   and  respectively 
as a growing organization  encore has devoted significant capital resources to expanding and improving its management information systems through additions of hardware and software 
the expenditures for these computer improvements were approximately  in   in and  in liquidity over the past three years  encore s working capital requirements have increased 
the increases have been in the areas of inventory and accounts receivable as sales and product base have expanded 
during  encore renegotiated its revolving credit facility from million to million with an eligible borrowing base as of december  of approximately million 
as of december  the company had drawn approximately million 
a distinguishing feature of the credit facility is that encore s cash management services are intermingled with it 
encore s bank accounts sweep  on a daily basis  funds to either reduce or increase the loan balance  as needed  and invests any excess funds if the loan balance equals zero  in a money market account 
as such  the outstanding loan balance is adjusted daily based on the net amount of cash receipts versus cash outlays  while the cash balance at wells fargo remains at zero as long as encore is a net borrower 
this sweep feature has the effect of minimizing interest cost  and automatically investing any excess funds 
the company s continued strong growth has resulted in an increase in its capital requirements 
this growth is now primarily funded by the credit facility and cash generated from operations to meet its working capital needs 
as of december  the company had net working capital of approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  this increase was primarily due to the increases in inventory and accounts receivable offset by the increase in the current portion of a payment to a related party 
during the third quarter of  the company began actively purchasing its equity securities  both common stock and warrants  in connection with the buyback program it announced at the beginning of this program was initiated because company management and the board of directors felt that the company s equity was undervalued 
through december   the company has repurchased  shares of common stock and  warrants 
this program is ongoing 
during december  the company conducted a tender offer for all of its outstanding warrants and rights to acquire warrants 
as a result of the tender offer   warrants and  rights were tendered and repurchased by the company 
year compliance the year yk issue stems from the way dates are recorded and computed in many computer systems because such programs use only the last two digits to indicate the year 
if uncorrected  these computer programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause computer system failure or other computer errors  thereby disrupting operations 
the company understands the importance of being prepared for yk 
the company s objective is to ensure an uninterrupted transition into yk and is progressing in a comprehensive plan to assure the achievement of that goal 
the scope of the year readiness effort includes evaluating information technology such as software and hardware  investigating other systems or embedded technology such as microcontrollers contained in various manufacturing and lab equipment  environmental and safety systems  and facilities and utilities  and assessing the readiness of key third parties  including suppliers  customers  and key financial institutions 
the company has identified the mission critical systems and has determined the critical manufacturing and non manufacturing systems are already yk capable  or replacements  changes  upgrades or workarounds have been identified 
the company expects to complete compliance tests of all vital systems in the third quarter of the company s products are not affected by the year issue 
the company is in contact with suppliers  customers and financial institutions to assure no interruption in the relationship between the company and these third parties concerning yk compliance issues 
highest priority is being placed on working with suppliers that are critical to the business 
the company has made inquiries to all third parties and has received a modest response to initial inquiries 
follow up activities will focus on critical suppliers and the actions being taken to fix year problems 
contingency plans are being developed to address issues related to suppliers that are not considered to be making sufficient progress in becoming year capable in a timely manner 
these plans generally emphasize the identification of alternative suppliers that are yk compliant 
the company believes that its most likely worst case year scenarios would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with the company s internal systems 
it is clear that the company has the least ability to assess and remediate the year problems of third parties and the company believes the risks are greatest with infrastructure eg electricity supply  water and sewer service  telecommunications  transportation supply chains and critical suppliers of materials 
the company is not in a position to identify or to avoid all possible scenarios however  the company is currently assessing scenarios and taking steps to mitigate the impacts of various scenarios if they were to occur 
this contingency planning will continue through as the company learns more about the preparations and vulnerabilities of third parties regarding year issues 
due to the large number of variables involved  the company cannot provide an estimate of the damage it might suffer if any of these scenarios were to occur 
the company currently expects that the total cost of year programs will not exceed  approximately  has been spent to date 
the estimated costs do not include any potential costs related to customer or other claims  or potential amounts related to executing contingency plans  such as costs incurred on account of an infrastructure or supplier failure 
the company has adequate general corporate funds with which to pay for the programs expected costs 
all expected costs are based on the current assessment of the programs and are subject to change as the programs progress 
the company is expensing all costs  other than capital equipment purchases  related to the assessment and remediation of the yk issue as incurred 
all costs are being funded through operating cash flows and are not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
forward looking statements the foregoing management s discussion and analysis contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of which represent encore s expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including  but not limited to  statements regarding growth in sales of encore s products  profit margins and the sufficiency of encore s cash flow for its future liquidity and capital resource needs 
these forward looking statements are further qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  the effect of competitive pricing  encore s dependence on the ability of its third party manufacturers to produce components on a basis which is cost effective to encore  market acceptance of encore s products and effects of government regulation 
results actually achieved may differ materially from expected results included in these statements as a result of these or other factors
