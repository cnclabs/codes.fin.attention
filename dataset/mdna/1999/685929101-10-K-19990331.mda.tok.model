revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
approximately million of the decrease was attributable to the aerospace defense market which experienced sharp declines in asia and us government contracts along with decreases in the satellite market of million  partially offset by an increase in the wireless market of million 
us sales led the biggest decline by approximately million followed by lower asian sales of million and european sales of million 
the licensing restrictions imposed on the company by the us state department in caused delays on many european and asian contracts  also leading to the declines 
such licensing restrictions may continue to cause delays  and in some cases denials  of licenses to export certain of the company s products and services 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million or 
gross margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   as a result of losses resulting from delays and uncertainties on certain exports related to licensing and other related charges combined with the revenue declines associated with the same and general slowness in the antenna test and measurement market 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a charge of  relating to the collectability of china receivables  approximately  of full period impact for the aemi acquisition  additional legal expenses of  additional bad debts of  with the remaining difference relating to investment in senior finance and general management 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for the year ended december   an increase from for the year ended december  additional investment in sales activity in orbit fr engineering  ltd israel and orbit fr europe germany accounted for  of this increase  while the full period impact of aemi accounted for  and the remaining difference is attributable to investments in senior management and direct sales staff 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or due mainly to reduced customer funded r d projects 
other charges 
other charges for the year ended december  were approximately million compared to no expense for the year ended december  the expense represented costs associated with the acquisition of rdl  inc which did not occur  expenses stemming from the company s internal investigation over the us customs matter including an estimate to settle the case with the us attorney  including related legal charges and charges related to the company s requirement to adopt revised export procedures in light of the new export classification of its products 
income taxes 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million compared to an expense of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million due principally to the loss incurred during the company s effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this was due mainly to the non deductibility of certain other charges related to the us customs matter 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
revenues from microwave test and measurement accounted for all of this increase 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to the aerospace defense industry which resulted from an improvement in the company s ability to capture opportunities within that industry significantly as a result of the acquisition of flam and russell in june with some growth in the industry s domestic commercial sector 
approximately million of the increase was attributable to the wireless communications industry  with 
million attributable to the satellite industry 
the automotive industry declined by 
million 
aemi revenues of approximately million recorded since the june  acquisition are included in the above amounts 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
gross margins rose from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   as a result of increased efficiencies in the company s solution  design  production and installation stages  as well as increasing use of the company s standard off the shelf components in its turnkey systems  plus an increased role for higher margin software sales  and the addition of aemi s high gross margin products since june  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  or 
aemi accounts for approximately  of this increase  and is offset by a slight decrease in orbit advanced technology inc s general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to an increase in revenues without a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  or 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses were for the year ended december   a decrease from for the year ended december  approximately  of this increase represents higher commissions due to increased sales  while approximately  of this increase is attributable to aemi 
the opening of the european office accounts for another  while the remaining  reflects increased sales force and marketing activity around the world 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
this increase reflected the additional development and improvement of the company s software and hardware products for the company s solutions for the wireless  automotive  satellite and aerospace markets 
other income 
other income for the year increased  due principally to the interest earnings on the initial public offering funds 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the company s effective tax rate increased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due to a lower proportion of the company s income being generated by its operations in israel where the tax rate is lower 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has satisfied its working capital requirements through cash flows from its operations 
recent reductions in revenues and increased costs associated with other charges as described above and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  have reversed this trend and caused recent negative cash flows from operations 
the company has two working capital bank lines of credit aggregating  at december   no amounts under these lines were outstanding 
these lines of credit were renewed in april  and bear interest at rates ranging from to over the bank s prime rate and are secured by accounts receivable 
the line of credit agreements require the company to comply with certain financial performance covenants with which the company was in compliance at december  at december   the note payable to parent of  represented a non interest bearing promissory note owed by orbit fr engineering  ltd  the company s israeli subsidiary to orbit alchut technologies  ltd  the majority shareholder of the company for the transfer by alchut of working capital at the end of this note is due in december net cash used in operating activities during amounted to approximately million compared to approximately million provided by operating activities in the most significant change in net cash provided by or used in operating activities resulted from the company posting a million net loss during the year ended december   compared to a million net profit during the year ended december  accounts receivable provided million of operating cash during the year ended december   while using  during the same period of the change in the company s costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts provided approximately  of operating cash during the year ended december   while using million during the same period in an additional use of cash from operating activities during the year ended december  was the reduction in the company s income taxes payable at december  for  while approximately  was provided by the change in income tax payable during the year ended december  this variance is mainly due to the company recording a million income tax benefit for the year ended december  due to the loss incurred 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due mainly to the aemi acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities in amounted to approximately million  completely due to the proceeds raised in connection with the company s initial public offering  net of offering expenses paid 
during net cash used in financing activities related to the company s purchase of treasury stock in the amount of  during  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately  a portion of which was used to improve the company s hardware and software tools  and by its initial investment in information systems for the company and its subsidiaries 
in the company plans to invest funds on the implementation of strategic systems 
the company has exposure to currency fluctuations as a result of billing certain of its contracts in foreign currency 
when selling to customers in countries with less stable currencies  the company bills in us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues was billed in currencies other than us dollars 
substantially all of the costs of the company s contracts  including costs subcontracted to alchut  have been  and will continue to be  us dollar denominated except for wages for employees of the company s foreign subsidiaries  which are denominated in local currency 
the company intends to continue to enter into us dollar denominated contracts 
inflation and seasonality the company does not believe that inflation or seasonality has had a significant effect on the company s operations to date 
impact of year some of the company s older computer systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost is estimated to be less than  which includes up to  for the purchase of new software that will be capitalized and  that will be expensed as incurred 
to date  the company has incurred and expensed approximately  primarily for the assessment of the year issue and the development of a modification plan for the purchase of new software 
the project is estimated to be completed no later than september   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
the company believes that due to its planned modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company believes that all of its products are year compliant except for its fr antenna rcs measurement system software and its fr digital pattern recorder software 
new versions of these products are nearing completion and will be available by june  with respect to third parties  many of the company s customers order products from the company using echo r  the company s proprietary software system  which is year compliant 
the company also utilizes electronic data interchange edi 
the company is partially complete with its remediation efforts relating to edi software and expects to be complete by june  the company is currently in process of developing contingency plans to address the year risks as necessary 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion of its year efforts by may  and to determine what contingency plans are necessary at that time 
as part of the plan  the company will survey its key suppliers to determine the extent to which the systems of such suppliers are year compliant  and the extent to which the company could be affected by the failure of such third parties to be year compliant 
at this time the company cannot estimate the impact of the failure of such third parties to be year compliant 
in the normal course of business  the company has contingency plans for disruption of business events and intends to augment those plans with specific year considerations 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and other similar uncertainties 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas established the standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
the only item of other comprehensive income loss which the company currently reports is the foreign currency translation adjustments  which have been insignificant to date 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on the company s financial position 
in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement no  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  which was adopted in sfas established standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the company operates in one industry segment 
information related to certain concentration disclosures is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  because the company has never used or currently intends to use derivatives  management does not anticipate that adoption of this new standard will have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the company 
certain factors certain information contained in this form k contains forward looking statements as such term is defined in the securities exchange act of and the regulations thereunder  including without limitation  statements as to the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources and statements as to management s beliefs  expectations or options 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and may be affected by various factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
certain of these risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed in item business  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and those set forth below 
rapid technological change 
the microwave test and measurement industry is characterized by rapid technological change 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability continually to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers and the technological advancements of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company does not currently have any material patents and relies principally on trade secret and copyright laws to protect its technology 
however  there can be no assurance that these steps will prevent misappropriation of its technology 
moreover  third parties could independently develop technologies that compete with the company s technologies 
although the company believes that its products and proprietary rights do not infringe patents and proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement claims  regardless of merit  will not be asserted against the company 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection of the company s proprietary technology may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
risks associated with acquisitions 
in the normal course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions that would complement or expand its business 
there can also be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully integrate the business and operations of any business acquired in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur disruptions and unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions 
in attempting to make acquisitions  the company often competes with other potential acquirers  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
furthermore  the process of evaluating  negotiating  financing and integrating acquisitions may divert management time and resources 
there can be no assurance that any acquisition  when consummated  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
dependence on alchut  operations in israel 
the company maintains and will continue to maintain a number of relationships with alchut  the major stockholder of the company 
alchut is the company s principal subcontractor for electro mechanical production  primarily in connection with the production of positioners 
in addition  alchut provides general and administrative services for the company s operations in israel 
effective january   the company and alchut entered into an agreement under which alchut will continue to provide these services for at least one year 
alchut maintains its production operations  and the company maintains part of its engineering operations  in israel 
as a result  the company may be directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
risks of fixed price contracts 
virtually all of the company s contracts for its systems and products are on a fixed price basis 
the profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of completion 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems in engineering  design or testing 
since the company s business may at certain times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any one contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with entering new markets 
the company has identified and is evaluating whether to enter into certain complementary markets 
the company s success in these markets will depend on  among other factors  the company s ability to identify markets and develop technologies for such markets on a timely basis  hire and retain skilled management  financial  marketing and engineering personnel  successfully manage growth and obtain capital sufficient to finance such expansion 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully enter these markets 
management of growth 
the company believes that growth will be required to maintain the company s competitive position 
future growth  coupled with the rapid evolution of the company s markets  has placed  and is likely to continue to place  significant strains on its management  administrative  operating and financial resources  as well as increased demands on its internal systems  procedures and controls 
the company s ability to manage future growth will require the company to continue to improve its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures on a timely basis  to implement new systems as necessary and to expand  train  motivate and manage its sales and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its growth successfully 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with international sales 
in  international sales comprised approximately of the company s total sales  and the company expects its international business to continue to account for a material part of its revenues 
international sales are subject to numerous risks  including political and economic instability in foreign markets  restrictive trade policies of foreign governments  inconsistent product regulation by foreign agencies or governments  imposition of product tariffs and burdens and costs of complying with a wide variety of international and us export laws and regulatory requirements 
the recent exertion of jurisdiction over certain products by the us state department produces additional risks for future exports 
with the jurisdiction change  all foreign sales of the company s antenna measurement systems and software and radome measurement systems require licensing 
delays in the process can lead to additional costs and the risk of customer retention 
the us state department may also deny a license to sell certain products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully in international markets or that its international sales will be profitable 
approximately of the company s sales in were denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the company believes that it does not have significant exposure to fluctuations in currency 
however  fluctuations in currency could adversely affect the company s customers 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s operating results have varied from quarter to quarter in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on factors such as the size and timing of significant contracts  the mix of third party products and the company s proprietary products included in a particular contract  customers budgetary constraints  increased competition  the timing of new product announcements and changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in operating expenses and changes in general economic factors and export license delays and denials 
the company s expense levels are based  in part  on its expectations as to future revenue levels 
if the company s revenue levels were to be below expectations  the company s operating results would likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on qualified technical personnel 
the company s operating results depend in large part upon the efforts of its microwave  software and systems engineers 
the success of the company s business therefore depends on its ability to attract and retain engineers and other technical personnel 
there are a limited number of microwave engineers  and such individuals are sought both by microwave test and measurement companies such as the company and by manufacturers of wireless products and telecommunications service providers 
competition for such personnel is intense 
the company has at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining technical personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties in the future in attracting and in retaining technical personnel 
dependence on key personnel 
the success of the company depends to a significant degree upon the contribution of its executive officers and other key personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its managerial and other key personnel or to attract additional managerial and other key personnel if required 
product liability  risk of product defects 
the sale of products and systems by the company may entail the risk of product liability and related claims 
a product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
complex software and system products  such as those offered by the company  may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
the company maintains product liability insurance in the amount of million and errors and omissions insurance in the amount of million  although there can be no assurance that such coverage will be applicable to a particular claim or that the amounts of such insurance will be adequate if the company experiences a significant claim 
although the company has not experienced any significant claims to date related to its systems or products  the occurrence of such a claim could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
competition 
the market for automated microwave test and measurement products  systems and services is highly competitive and is characterized by continuing advances in products and technologies 
in general  competition in this market comes from major microwave test and measurement vendors  some of which have a longer operating history  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than the company 
these companies also have established relationships with current and potential customers of the company 
the company is in compliance with all export regulations  however its competitors may be selling their products with out licenses 
the company also competes  on a limited basis  with the internal development groups of its existing and potential customers  who may design and develop parts of their own microwave test and measurement systems 
the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by such competition 
fluctuations in capital spending 
the company is dependent upon the wireless communications  satellite  automotive and aerospace defense industries 
because these industries are characterized by technological change  pricing and gross margin pressure and  particularly in the aerospace defense industry  government budget constraints  they have from time to time experienced sudden economic downturns 
during these periods  capital spending is frequently curtailed and the number of design projects often decreases 
since the company s sales are dependent upon capital spending trends and new design projects  negative factors affecting these industries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
no dividends 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate that any cash dividends will be declared or paid in the foreseeable future 
issuance of preferred stock and common stock  anti takeover provisions 
pursuant to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation  the company has an authorized class of  shares of preferred stock which may be issued by the board of directors with such terms and such rights  preferences and designations as the board may determine and without any vote of the stockholders  unless otherwise required by law 
issuance of such preferred stock  depending upon the rights  preferences and designations thereof  may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company 
issuance of additional shares common stock could result in dilution of the voting power of the common stock purchased in this offering 
in addition  certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law among other things  may restrict the ability of the stockholders to approve a merger or business combination or obtain control of the company
