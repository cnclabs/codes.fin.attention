item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margins and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  and intend and other similar expressions constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to those discussed in cautionary statements as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this prospectus 
overview we research  develop  manufacture  market  and service lasers used to perform aesthetic and cosmetic procedures 
we sell our lasers principally to medical practitioners 
candela markets its products directly and through a network of distributors to end users 
our traditional customer base includes plastic and cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists 
more recently  we have expanded our sales to a broader group of practitioners consisting of general practitioners and certain specialists including obstetricians  gynecologists  and general and vascular surgeons 
over of our revenue in fiscal came from international sales 
we derive our revenue from the sale of lasers and other products  the provision of product related services  and the operations of our remaining skin care center 
domestic and international product sales are generated principally through our direct sales force based in the us and three international offices 
prior to fiscal  a relatively small portion of our sales have come through our network of independent distributors 
in december  we entered into an exclusive distributorship arrangement with physician sales and service pss whose representatives target general practice physicians and certain specialists in the us sales to distributors for the year ended july   increased as a result of this arrangement 
since we began marketing the gentlelase r in  sales of this product have accounted for an increasing percentage of our total revenue 
for our fiscal year ended july   sales of gentlelase r and its accessories accounted for of our total revenue 
we typically assemble products in our wayland  massachusetts  facility in the quarter in which they are shipped  and backlog has not been significant 
we experience some seasonal reduction of our product sales in the quarter ending in september due to the summer holiday schedule of physicians and their patients 
all product shipments include a month parts and service warranty 
the anticipated cost associated with the warranty coverage is accrued at the time of shipment and amortized over the warranty period as a cost of sales charged to service revenue 
costs associated with product installation are also recognized as costs of product related service revenue 
both such anticipated and actual costs have no associated revenue and therefore reduce the gross profit from product related service revenue 
product related service revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and repair services and the sale of spare parts and consumables 
we derive revenue from extended warranty contracts  which are typically for a to month period 
in addition  we provide on site service worldwide on a time and materials basis directly or through our distributors 
in june  we began an effort to own and operate skin care centers offering cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
we pursued this strategy by purchasing an existing spa in boston in in march  we opened a new skin care center in scottsdale  arizona  with no pre existing client base 
we subsequently decided to reduce our focus on our skin care center efforts and to renew our commitment to our core aesthetic and cosmetic laser business 
in the quarter ending december   we closed our scottsdale facility because it had failed to generate any material revenue from its inception  recorded a restructuring charge  and established a reserve in the amount of million which represented the anticipated cost associated with this closure 
in january  we ceased to offer aesthetic laser procedures at our boston skin care center because the rate of performance was insufficient to justify the associated costs  but we continue to provide personal care and health and beauty services from this location 
we are actively seeking buyers to assume the leases and purchase the assets of both the scottsdale and boston facilities 
international revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  during the fiscal years ended july   and june   represented and of total sales  respectively 
our fiscal year consists of the or week period ending on the saturday closest to june of each year 
the years ended july   june   and june   contained  and weeks  respectively 
results of operations the following tables set forth selected financial data for the periods indicated  expressed as percentages 
for the year ended july  june  june  revenue mix percentage of total revenue lasers and other products product related service skin care centers total operating ratios gross profit percentage of each revenue category lasers and other products product related service skin care centers total operating expense percentage of total revenue selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charge total income loss from operations other income expense net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue 
total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal international product revenue  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  was of total revenue for fiscal compared to for the same period in laser and product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this was due mainly to a significant increase in the volume of both domestic and international shipments of the gentlelase r  which we began shipping in march product related service revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was attributable to shipments of consumables used with the gentlelase r and sclero products 
skin care center revenue increased to million in compared to million in  due to increased marketing and promotional activities for our boston spa 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million or of revenue in fiscal from million or of revenue in fiscal as a result of increased sales of higher margin gentlelase r and higher absorption of fixed portions of manufacturing overhead 
gross profit on lasers and other products increased to million or in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal gross profit for service revenue in fiscal increased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue for fiscal skin care center gross profit for the year ended july  was positively impacted  in comparison to  by the closure of the scottsdale facility in the second quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this reflects increased staffing levels in the sales and marketing departments incurred to support revenue growth  partially offset by savings realized from operating one skin care center rather than two during the first six months of the fiscal year 
also affecting selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal was an expense of approximately million for the payment of management bonuses which are tied to pre tax profits derived from product and service revenue 
in fiscal  the management bonus accrued amounted to approximately  in relation to revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses was of revenue in fiscal compared to for fiscal research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal increased to million  from million for fiscal the increase in research and development expense reflects efforts to develop products and product improvements designed to enhance  augment  and expand existing product lines 
research and development expense also includes approximately  of management bonuses  which are tied to pre tax profits 
restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended december   a restructuring charge was recorded and a reserve established in the amount of million resulting from the closure of the skin care center located in scottsdale  arizona 
during fiscal  a total of  was charged against this reserve  representing costs associated with the closure of the scottsdale facility leaving a reserve balance of million 
candela continues to pursue a sublease of the scottsdale facility  but if this effort is not successful  we could incur additional costs in excess of our existing reserve 
management believes that the reserve established to date will be sufficiently adequate so that no additional material charges will need to be recorded for at least the next months 
operating income 
income from operations for the year ended july   increased by million  from a loss of million in fiscal to a profit of million  in fiscal the improved performance was a result of both increased revenue from product sales and reduced expenses in connection with operations of the skin care centers 
other income expense 
for the fiscal year ended july   total other expense was  in comparison to  for the same period a year earlier 
the increase resulted from an increase in interest expenses from the debt issued in october   partially offset by a decrease in exchange losses from our foreign operations and an increase in interest income resulting from higher cash balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   reflects the utilization of the domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax provisions calculated in japan and spain at a rate in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million at june   the beginning of the current fiscal year 
based on current year operating results  we utilized all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and the federal tax credit carryforwards 
we also released million of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal is approximately 
during the second quarter of fiscal  candela believed that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset would be utilized during therefore  the company  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for income taxes  decreased its valuation allowance for the portion related to the utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards against current year taxable income  resulting in a decrease to its effective rate 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenue 
total revenue for fiscal increased over fiscal to million from million 
international revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  represented of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal laser and product revenue increased slightly to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal increased shipments of gentlelase r were partially offset by an sales decline in our japanese subsidiary as a result of the erosion of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar during this period 
product related service revenue increased in fiscal over fiscal to million from million 
this increase was primarily the result of increased service in our spanish subsidiary 
skin care center revenue for fiscal increased over fiscal to million from million primarily as a result of operating two skin care centers in fiscal compared to fiscal when only the boston skin care center was operating 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million or of total revenue in fiscal from million or of total revenue in fiscal this decline was primarily due to the negative effect of currency devaluation on japanese sales and a decrease in gross margins from the skin care centers resulting from increased medical procedure costs 
gross profit from product revenue for fiscal was million  basically unchanged from million for fiscal gross profit from product related service revenue decreased to million or in fiscal compared to million or in fiscal this decline in product related service gross profit is attributable to warranty expenses associated with the initial shipments of the gentlelase r which were estimated to be higher than our historical experience 
skin care center gross profit declined to  or of total revenue  from  or of total revenue  due to the higher operating costs and minimal revenue associated with the scottsdale facility 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  as a result of charges incurred in the second quarter for legal and consulting fees and taking a full reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts and notes receivable from a domestic distributor 
selling  general and administrative expense was of total revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal research and development expense 
research and development spending for fiscal decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal restructuring charge 
during the quarter ended december   a restructuring charge was recorded and a reserve established in the amount of million resulting from the closure of our skin care center located in scottsdale  arizona 
charges against the reserve for fiscal totaled  leaving a reserve balance of million 
operating income loss 
we experienced an operating loss in fiscal of million compared to an operating profit of  in fiscal this decline was a result of the restructuring charge  higher selling  general and administrative expenses  and declining margins from product related service revenue and the skin care centers 
other income and expense 
for fiscal  other income and expense reflected  in expense in comparison to  in expense for fiscal interest income decreased in fiscal as a result of a decrease in average cash balances  while interest expense increased in fiscal as a result of the increased level of debt and lease financing 
other expenses in fiscal included an increase in expense from foreign currency transactions 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal was established due to taxable income from our subsidiaries in spain and japan 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities amounted to million for fiscal compared to cash used for operating activities of million in fiscal  reflecting increased operating profit 
cash used in investing activities totaled  for compared to  for the same period a year earlier 
cash provided by financing activities amounted to  in in comparison to million for we issued million eight year  subordinated term notes with warrants in october and used the proceeds of this financing in part to pay the balance of million on our line of credit 
we borrowed million on our line of credit during the same period a year ago 
cash and cash equivalents at july  increased by million to million from million at june   due primarily to higher cash receipts resulting from increased shipments of gentlelase r 
on october   we issued eight year  subordinated term notes to three investors in the aggregate amount of million 
the notes become due in october   and require quarterly interest payments 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to the note holders that have an exercise price of per share 
the relative fair value ascribed to the warrants is  and has been recorded as a component of additional paid in capital in stockholders equity 
the relative fair value of the debt was recorded as  the debt will be accreted to face value using the interest method over eight years  which will result in interest expense of  over the eight year period in addition to the face interest 
we also maintain a million line of credit with a major bank which expires december  the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate and is collateralized by total domestic accounts receivable  inventories  and a pledge of subsidiary stock 
at july  we had no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit 
our japanese subsidiary borrowed funds to be used for payment of equipment purchases made from the us parent 
at july   this liability was  based upon year end exchange rates 
our remaining short term and long term debt is comprised of capital lease obligations in the amount of  and  respectively  at july   compared to  and  respectively  at june  subsequent to the end of fiscal  we completed a public offering in july  for  shares of common stock  of which  shares were sold by candela and  shares were sold by certain selling shareholders 
we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of our shares 
accordingly  on a pro forma basis  had the offering occurred on july   we would have had approximately million in cash at year end 
we believe that cash balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements through the first quarter of fiscal however  we cannot be sure that we will not require additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us  nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as required 
year readiness disclosure statement we have assessed our operations  from information and financial systems to each aspect of our manufacturing processes  including non information systems and products  in order to reduce the risk of operational disruption and potential litigation due to the year issue 
we have completed approximately of the implementation and testing of the necessary upgrades to our financial and information systems and expect to finish our upgrades prior to the end of october our year assessment identified no need for upgrades to our products and non information systems 
to date  we have primarily used our internal resources to assess our year readiness 
we have currently incurred less than  of incremental costs relating to year readiness and believe that we will incur less than  of additional incremental costs in the foreseeable future 
candela has questioned representatives of litton airtron synoptics  our sole supplier for alexandrite rods  and pss  a major distributor  and has reviewed publicly available disclosures relating to pss 
litton has indicated that their business systems are year compliant 
based on this review  candela is not aware of any information indicating that litton or pss will experience substantial year problems 
in addition  we have conducted an informal survey of our other suppliers  significant customers  and business partners 
while responses to this survey indicate that many of our suppliers and customers are year compliant  we have not yet received sufficient information from all parties about their year preparedness to assess the effectiveness of their efforts 
moreover  in most cases  we are not in a position to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information we receive from third parties 
if third parties with whom we interact have year problems that are not remedied  we could experience problems including the following in the case of vendors  disruption of important services upon which we depend  such as telecommunications and electrical power  in the case of customers  temporary reduction in their purchasing activities as they implement upgraded systems  in the case of third party data providers  receipt of inaccurate or out of date information that would impair our ability to perform critical data functions  and in the case of banks and other lenders  disruption of capital flows  potentially resulting in liquidity stress 
while we believe that year disruptions will not materially hurt our business  in the worst case scenario our systems  or those of our suppliers and customers  may not function properly after december  this could result in delays in operations which would significantly harm our financial condition and operating results 
in some international markets in which we do business  the level of awareness and remediation efforts relating to the year issue may be less advanced than in the us we are in the process of formulating a contingency plan to address the failure of our most important organizational systems  which we expect to be substantially complete by october we anticipate that our contingency plan will focus on identifying additional suppliers that can be utilized in the event of a year disruption

the cautionary statements noted below and other factors noted throughout this annual report on form k could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
we may not update or publicly release the results of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof 
our dependence on gentlelase r increases our susceptibility to competitive changes in the marketplace 
we introduced our gentlelase r in march gentlelase r s sales have grown rapidly and accounted for more than half of our total revenue in fiscal heavy dependence on gentlelase r sales increases our susceptibility to changes in the marketplace  such as competitors reducing prices or adding new features to their products  or customers ordering fewer of our products 
such changes in the marketplace could hurt our financial results 
our exclusive rights to the dcd technology could become non exclusive because our amended license agreement requires us to make commercially reasonable efforts to conclude sublicense agreements with third parties  or we could lose our rights to the dcd technology altogether if a court challenge to the underlying patent is successful 
due to the terms of an amended license agreement entered into in october  candela could lose its exclusive rights to our dynamic cooling device dcd  or the patent under which the dcd was developed could be invalidated as a result of pending litigation 
we developed our dcd  which is used to selectively cool the subject s outermost layer of skin during cosmetic laser treatments  under an exclusive license to patent rights owned by the regents of the university of california 
the dcd is an integral component of our biggest selling device  the gentlelase r  and is also currently sold as an attachment to our other principal laser device  the scleroplus tm 
we believe the efficacy of the dcd has been a key element in the recent growth in sales of our laser devices 
in october  we entered into an amendment of the license agreement which provided us with an exclusive right under the regents patent to make  use  and sell the dynamic cooling technology in all fields of use 
however  this amendment also imposes on us an obligation to negotiate in good faith and make commercially reasonable efforts to conclude sublicensing agreements with third parties  subject to certain stipulated minimum terms and conditions 
if we fail to negotiate in good faith or enter into sublicenses with third parties within certain time periods  the regents may then grant license rights to such third parties directly  provided that candela will receive of all revenues received under such licenses 
by letter dated september   the regents notified us that we were in default under the license agreement  as amended 
the notice of default states that it is based on our alleged failure to make all royalty payments deemed by the regents to be due  our alleged failure to engage in good faith negotiations with third parties expressing an interest in sublicensing the dcd technology  and our alleged failure to provide a draft license agreement to those third parties expressing an interest in sublicensing the dcd technology 
the regents default notice gives us sixty days to cure the alleged default 
we have responded in writing to the regents notice of default  informing the regents that we are in full compliance with the terms of the license  as amended 
we believe that the regents notice of default is without merit and will challenge any effort by the regents to terminate the license 
if the regents successfully terminate our dcd license  we will lose our rights to the dcd technology 
in addition  our financial condition will be adversely affected if the regents prevail on their claim that we have not made all required royalty payments 
to date  candela has corresponded with seven prospective sublicensees of the dcd technology who were identified by the regents as potentially interested in obtaining a sublicense for that technology 
of these seven entities  two expressed an interest in pursuing sublicensing discussions 
candela provided term sheets for a sublicense to each of them 
one of these entities  laser aesthetics  inc  and its parent corporation  new star lasers  inc  responded by commencing litigation seeking  among other things  to invalidate the regents patent under which the dcd was developed 
the other entity has not responded to the term sheet 
candela has sent additional correspondence to the other entities who were identified by the regents reminding them that candela remains willing to open negotiations with them for the sublicensing of dcd technology  but has not received any further response 
we have requested that  in light of our efforts to negotiate sublicenses with entities brought to our attention by the regents  the regents agree to extend the time periods set forth by the license amendment 
the regents have denied that request 
we will contest any sublicense the regents grant for the dcd technology on the grounds that the regents refusal to agree to our request to extend the time periods set forth in the license amendment was unreasonable 
while no such sublicenses or further licenses have been granted by us or the regents to date  principal competitors of ours  or new entrants into the medical laser industry  may successfully conclude licensing arrangements providing them with access to the dynamic cooling technology 
while our agreement with the regents provides that we would receive from all such licenses  the loss of exclusivity to this technology could hurt our financial results 
in addition  while we believe the litigation commenced by new star lasers  inc challenging the validity of the regents patent rights is without merit  we can t be certain that the regents patent rights will not be reduced or invalidated  which could also hurt our business and financial results 
because we derive more than half of our revenue from international sales  including approximately one third of our revenue from japan and the asia pacific marketplace in fiscal  we are susceptible to currency fluctuations  negative economic changes taking place in japan and the asia pacific marketplace  and other risks associated with conducting business overseas 
we sell a significant portion of our products and services outside the us and canada 
international sales  consisting of sales from our subsidiaries in germany  spain  and japan  and sales shipped directly to international locations from the us  accounted for and of our revenue for fiscal years and  respectively  and we expect that they will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability  or could cause prospective customers to push out orders because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation 
for example  in our fiscal year ended june   we experienced an decline in product sales to japanese customers as a result of the erosion of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar during this period 
other risks associated with international sales which we have faced in the past include longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  failure to obtain or significant delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulatory approvals for our products  difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign operations 
the failure to obtain alexandrite rods for the gentlelase r and alexlazr tm from our sole supplier would impair our ability to manufacture and sell gentlelase r  which accounted for more than half of our revenue in the fiscal year ended july  we use alexandrite rods to manufacture the gentlelase r and the alexlazr tm  which account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we depend exclusively on litton airtron synoptics to supply these rods  for which no alternative supplier meeting our quality standards exists 
we cannot be certain that litton will be able to meet our future requirements at current prices or at all 
to date  we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of alexandrite rods in a timely manner  but any extended interruption in our supplies could hurt our results 
disappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has had the least amount of revenue in any quarter of our fiscal year 
the results of the first quarter are directly impacted by the seasonality of the purchasing cycle 
in the last three fiscal years  first quarter revenue has been below the previous quarter s revenue in the range of to 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons  some of which are outside of our control  including the following market supply and demand potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between us and our competitors  potential decrease in demand for our products  and possible delays in market acceptance of our new products 
customer behavior changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles  and changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
company operations absence of significant product backlogs  our effectiveness in our manufacturing process  unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels  service providers  or customer support organizations  and timing of any acquisitions and related costs 
the cost of closing our skin care centers may be higher than management has estimated to date  and higher actual costs would negatively impact our operating results 
we have renewed our commitment to expand and diversify our core cosmetic and surgical laser equipment business 
as part of this refocus  we decided to reduce our focus on our efforts to own and operate centers which would offer cosmetic laser treatments utilizing our equipment  along with providing other cosmetic services traditionally offered by high end spas 
although we are actively seeking buyers for the two skin care centers we opened which are located in scottsdale  arizona  and boston  massachusetts  we cannot be certain that a sale or sublease of either facility will be completed on favorable terms or at all 
we have established a reserve to accrue for the anticipated costs of terminating the scottsdale facility  but we can t be sure that such a reserve will be adequate 
to date  we have not established a reserve in connection with the boston facility  which we are continuing to operate as a spa without providing cosmetic laser services 
our failure to expand our sales force and distribution channels would inhibit our ability to grow 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force and we support our customers with our internal technical and customer support staff 
to achieve significant revenue growth in the future we must recruit and train sufficient technical  customer  and direct sales personnel 
we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in recruiting qualified sales  technical  and support personnel 
we also rely on our network of distributors and our relationship with pss for sales of our products 
our inability to rapidly and effectively expand our direct sales force and our technical and support staff or our failure to maintain effective distribution relationships with pss and other distributors could hurt our business 
our failure to respond to rapid changes in technology and intense competition in the laser industry could make our lasers obsolete 
the aesthetic and cosmetic laser equipment industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations 
to be successful  we must be responsive to new developments in laser technology and new applications of existing technology 
our financial condition and operating results could be hurt if our products fail to compete favorably in response to such technological developments  or we are not agile in responding to competitors new product introductions or product price reductions 
in addition  we compete against numerous companies offering products similar to ours  some of which have greater financial  marketing  and technical resources than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies and our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
like other companies in our industry  we are subject to a regulatory review process and our failure to receive necessary government clearances or approvals could affect our ability to sell our products and remain competitive 
the types of medical devices that we seek to market in the us generally must receive either k clearance or pma approval in advance from the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has deemed our products eligible for the k clearance process 
we believe that most of our products in development will receive similar treatment 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not impose the more burdensome pma approval process upon one or more of our future products  nor can we be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
particularly  for example  we are awaiting ministry of health approval in japan for the sale of scleroplus tm 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or continue to obtain any such government approvals or successfully comply with any such foreign regulations in a timely and cost effective manner  if at all  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we have modified some of our products without fda clearance 
the fda could retroactively decide the modifications were improper and require us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
any modification to one of our k cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  but we believe that new k clearances are not required 
we cannot be certain that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance 
achieving complete compliance with fda regulations is difficult  and if we fail to comply  we could be subject to fda enforcement action 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda s regulatory scheme is complex  especially the quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures 
this complexity makes complete compliance difficult to achieve 
also  the determination as to whether a qsr violation has occurred is often subjective 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the qsr or other applicable requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies  such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties against us  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of our production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing product approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
unanticipated changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulation affecting our industry could adversely affect our ability to remain competitive and profitable 
a host of regulatory requirements apply to the manufacture and commercial distribution of our devices after the fda and foreign governments have cleared them for marketing 
unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may incur unexpected costs to comply with other government regulations 
we also must comply with numerous laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control  and hazardous substance disposal 
we may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future and we cannot be sure that such laws or regulations will not hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non infringing technology 
our industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the us until such patents are issued and are maintained in secrecy for a period of time outside the us accordingly  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications of others 
any claims of patent infringement would be time consuming and could result in costly litigation  divert our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
one such litigation matter is currently pending  new star lasers  inc s action to invalidate the patent under which the dcd was developed  and others could occur at any time 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the laser industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could hurt our gross margins 
in addition  we cannot be sure that the necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or the failure to obtain necessary licenses  could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products  which could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
on the other hand  we may have to start costly and time consuming litigation in order to enforce our patents  to protect trade secrets  and know how owned by us or to determine the enforceability  scope  and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
we have received correspondence on behalf of palomar medical technologies informing us that palomar is the exclusive licensee to certain unites states patents and offering to grant us a nonexclusive license to such patent 
we have determined that two of the palomar patents are unrelated to our products  and continue to study the other two patents to determine whether they have any application to our products  and if so  the value of non exclusive rights to such patents 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims 
there are various risks of physical injury to the patient when using our lasers for aesthetic and cosmetic treatments
