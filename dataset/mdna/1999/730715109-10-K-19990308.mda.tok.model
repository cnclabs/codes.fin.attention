item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition of the company at december  and results of operations for the company for the three years ended december   and of certain factors that may affect the company s prospective financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein 
for the reasons set forth below including the reclassification into assets held for sale of a substantial portion of the company s assets in the third quarter of and related accounting consequences and the inception of two businesses in the second half of the company s results of operations and cash flows for  and are not comparable to each other or to prior periods 
overview the company is a specialty financial services company 
the company s financial statements consolidate the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc  fourteen hill  allegiance and pws 
until february  the company provided viatical settlements for terminally ill persons 
see cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets  name change 
subsequently  the company has sought to become a broad based specialty financial services company 
to that end  the company has expanded its financial services business through fourteen hill  allegiance and pws 
the company continues to evaluate other potential business opportunities 
fourteen hill  allegiance and pws  whose business activities are described under item business  may or may not be indicative of the types of business opportunities the company will continue to pursue 
see method of consolidation and considerations under the investment company act of below 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in becoming a broad based specialty financial services company or that any such enterprise will be successful 
cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets  name change the principal business activity of the company through february was to provide viatical settlements for terminally ill persons 
a viatical settlement is the payment of cash in return for an ownership interest in  and right to receive the death benefit face value from  a life insurance policy 
on july   the company announced that  in light of the data regarding new treatments involving combinations of various drugs presented at the aids conference  the company was temporarily ceasing processing new applications for policies insuring individuals afflicted with aids and hiv while it further analyzed the effects of such research results on its business and its strategic options 
further analysis resulted in the company s concluding that the efficacy of the treatments reported at the aids conference and subsequently reported treatments had increased the risks of purchasing and holding policies insuring the lives of individuals diagnosed with hiv and aids 
the company decided in the third quarter of to sell all or substantially all of its assets 
as a result of this decision  the company reclassified all of its assets other than the policies held by dpfc to a held for sale category during the third quarter of accordingly  these assets are accounted for at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the company cannot predict what further impact the foregoing may have on its results of operations or financial position 
based on the company s evaluation of the effects of the research results reported at the aids conference and subsequent reports and other information  the company believed that it had become extremely difficult to predict accurately life expectancy of people afflicted with hiv and aids 
further  the company decided that it was not viable to continue to operate a viatical settlement business solely for non aids policies while a market for non aids policies developed  if it developed at all 
as a result  the board in february approved the cessation of the viatical settlement business and the sale by the company of its non aids policies 
through december   the company entered into agreements to sell approximately policies with an aggregate sale price of million  representing million in aggregate face value 
through december   the company consummated the sale of policies for million  representing million in aggregate face value 
at december   the company owned policies under the aforementioned sales agreements with a carrying value of  and a face value of  the company also continues to hold  through dpfc  a substantial amount of policies  which at december  totaled policies with a face value of million and a carrying value of million 
because the company no longer engages in the viatical settlement business  the board determined that a change in the company s name was appropriate 
the company sought and received in june stockholder approval to amend point west s certificate of incorporation to change its name from dignity partners  inc to point west capital corporation 
the name change was effective august  method of consolidation dpfc the company s financial statements consolidate the assets  liabilities and operations of dpfc  point west s wholly owned subsidiary through which the company issued the securitized notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
dpfc no longer purchases policies 
dignity viatical dignified one dignity viatical settlement partners  lp dignity viatical was a limited partnership formed in to fund purchases of life insurance policies 
point west served as the sole general partner  and persons not affiliated with the company were limited partners 
because point west controlled dignity viatical  the assets  liabilities and operations of dignity viatical were consolidated in the company s consolidated financial statements from to june  the minority interest of former limited partners in investment partnership reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements represents the limited partners interests in the net assets and income of dignity viatical 
in june  point west purchased the limited partnership interests in dignity viatical and became the sole owner of all of the partnership interests therein 
in  the company sold virtually all of the policies owned by dignity viatical 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
dignified one was a limited partnership formed in to fund purchases of life insurance policies 
all policies held by dignified one were collected or sold by september due to its immateriality  dignified one has been treated as an investment for accounting purposes 
therefore  the policies purchased by dignified one are not reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
fourteen hill the company also consolidates the assets  liabilities and operations of fourteen hill 
allegiance the company also consolidates the assets  liabilities and operations of allegiance 
in september  the company formed allegiance capital  a limited liability company  to provide senior secured loans to funeral home and cemetery owners 
point west made the only capital contribution to allegiance capital 
during  point west was allocated all interest on loans through november   which was the initial funding date for the allegiance financing 
additionally  point west will be allocated interest based on the weighted average interest rate of all loans outstanding to the extent that point west s capital investment in allegiance exceeds million 
net profits of allegiance capital for each calendar year will be allocated first to point west in an amount equal to a return of per annum  compounded monthly  on the amount of its capital contribution  but not in excess of such net profits 
any shortfall will be carried forward indefinitely to the next calendar year or years in which net profits are sufficient to make such allocation 
an additional return for each calendar year will be allocated first to point west to the extent that in each year sufficient profits are available with no carry forward provided 
allegiance capital owns of allegiance funding  which is a special purpose subsidiary formed to acquire and securitize loans originated by allegiance capital 
pursuant to the allegiance trust agreement  allegiance funding formed a trust  allegiance trust i  to consummate the allegiance financing 
see liquidity and capital resources allegiance below 
pws the company also consolidates the assets  operations and liabilities of pws 
operations for pws in were immaterial 
share repurchase program in october  the board approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which the company was authorized to purchase from time to time up to million shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
in june  such authority was increased to million shares of common stock 
in june  the company completed the share repurchase program  having repurchased an aggregate of million shares at a weighted average price of per share 
results of operations for the company year ended december  compared to year ended december  total income 
total income decreased to million in from million in due primarily to a million decrease in the gain on assets life insurance policies sold 
in addition  total income for included a  net gain on sale of non marketable securities sold by point west in offsetting this decrease was an aggregate increase of  in interest income and other income related to the activities of allegiance and fourteen hill 
total expenses 
total expenses increased to million in from million in due primarily to a million loss on non marketable securities recognized by fourteen hill in contributing to the increase in were i a  increase in compensation and benefits resulting from the hiring of employees to support allegiance s and pws activities and an increase in salaries and other benefits for other employees for  and ii a  increase in other general and administrative expenses due to increased premium expenses incurred in connection with life insurance policies held by dpfc

net loss in wholly owned financing subsidiary charged to reserve for equity interest 
the dpfc net loss of million and million recorded in and  respectively  were included in the company s loss before income taxes and net loss in wholly owned financing subsidiary charged to reserve for equity interest 
prior to the depletion of the reserve during the third quarter of  losses were charged against the reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary 
after the reserve was fully depleted during the third quarter of  dpfc s losses have been reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
all additional losses of dpfc will be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss for the periods in which such losses occur 
comprehensive income 
comprehensive income decreased to million in from million in  as a result of a decrease in the market value of marketable investment securities held by fourteen hill 
in addition  million of unrealized gains were recorded in in connection with warrants which were exercised in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company also had holdings which under generally accepted accounting principles gaap were carried at cost 
in particular  at december  the company was carrying at cost  an investment which had on file a registration statement with the sec for an initial public offering which is scheduled to occur in march in addition  another investment carried at cost was preferred shares convertible into marketable securities 
if the company had converted such convertible shares in  an unrealized gain of million would have been recorded on the balance sheet at december  the company converted of these shares to marketable securities in february 
see results of operations by segment fourteen hill 
since fourteen hill was not formed until  there was no comprehensive income in year ended december  compared to year ended december  total income 
total income decreased to million in from million in due primarily to a million decrease in earned discounts 
earned discounts decreased because the company began recognizing income with respect to its viatical settlement business upon receipt of proceeds on policies 
offsetting this decrease was i a million increase in the gain on assets life insurance policies sold  ii a  net gain on sale of non marketable securities  and iii a  increase in interest income resulting from the investment of the proceeds from the gain on assets sold in short term securities and marketable securities 
total expenses 
total expenses decreased to million in from million in due primarily to the million loss on investment in wholly owned financing subsidiary  dpfc  and the million provision for loss on assets held for sale both recorded in in addition  a  reduction in interest expense contributed to the decrease 
income tax expense 
in the company recorded  for minimum state income taxes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss in wholly owned financing subsidiary charged to reserve for equity interest 
at december  and the reserve to reflect the estimated loss of point west s entire equity interest in dpfc was million and million  respectively 
the dpfc net loss of million and  recorded in and  respectively  was included in the company s loss before income taxes and net loss in wholly owned financing subsidiary charged to reserve for equity interest 
this loss was charged against the reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary 
results of operations by segment viatical settlements the viatical settlements segment includes results of operations in connection with viatical settlements for dpfc  point west and dignity viatical 
method of accounting for viatical settlements through june   the company recognized income earned discount on each purchased policy by accruing  over the period between the acquisition date of the policy and the company s estimated date of collection of the policy s face value the accrual period  the difference the unearned discount between a the face value of the policy less the amount of fees  if any  payable to a referral source upon collection of the face value  and b the carrying value of the policy 
through june   the carrying value for each policy was reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet under purchased life insurance policies and consisted of the purchase price  other capitalized costs and the earned discount on the policy accrued to the balance sheet date 
the company capitalized as incurred the following costs of a purchased policy i the purchase price paid for the policy  ii policy premiums  if any  paid by the company  iii amounts  if any  paid to referral sources upon acquisition of the policy and iv amounts paid to company retained physicians or other medical consultants consultants who estimated the insured s life expectancy 
the carrying value of a policy changed over time  and was adjusted quarterly to reflect earned discounts accrued on the policy and amounts paid for any additional future increases in coverage  any additional premium payments and any premium refunds if the policy becomes covered by premium waiver provisions 
the length of the accrual period was determined by the company based upon its estimate of the date on which it would collect the face value of the policy 
such estimate was based upon the company s estimate of the life expectancy of the insured  after review of the medical records of the insured by one or more consultants  and was also adjusted to reflect the historical accuracy of the life expectancies estimated by the consultants and the typical period between the date of an insured s death and the date on which the company collects the face value of the policy 
the unearned discount was accrued over the accrual period using the level yield interest method 
under the level yield method  the yield was held constant such that when the yield was applied to the carrying value of the policy on a compounded basis over the course of the accrual period  the unearned discount was fully accrued as earned discount by the end of the accrual period 
as a result of the company s decision in to sell all or substantially all of its assets  the company established a reserve for loss on sale of assets during this reserve is reevaluated quarterly 
the reserve for loss on sale of assets was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
in  the company also established a reserve for loss of point west s equity interest in dpfc because of the uncertainties created by the data presented at the aids conference and subsequent reports of the efficacy of new treatments for aids hiv 
the reserve for loss of point west s equity interest in dpfc was million as of december  by the end of the third quarter of  the reserve was fully depleted 
see certain accounting implications for dpfc 
in addition  beginning in  the company began recognizing income with respect to its viatical settlement business upon receipt of proceeds on policies either pursuant to sale of the policy or the death of the insured 
such income is equal to the difference between such proceeds less any back end sourcing fees and the carrying value of such policies after giving effect to any reserve for loss on the sale of such policies 
the company also no longer included in the carrying value of policies premiums incurred after june  certain accounting implications for dpfc although the securitized notes have a stated maturity of march   the securitized notes were originally expected to be repaid by the fourth quarter of however  at december   million remained outstanding under the securitized notes 
as a result of the substantially delayed collection of dpfc policies  dpfc had a deficit of million at december  if the collection experience for the dpfc policies continues to be substantially delayed  dpfc s deficit will increase for one or more of the following reasons 
first  a decision to discontinue paying premiums on some policies may be made because the present value of the expected death benefit on some policies may be less than expected future premiums to be paid on such policies 
second  the face value of certain policies especially group term may begin to decrease as the people whose lives are insured thereunder reach specified age levels often 
finally  policies for which the insurance was continued under a disability provision may be uneconomical to convert given the insured s age and life expectancy if such insured person is no longer considered disabled 
the company cannot determine at present the extent to which policies held by dpfc will be so affected 
in  the total loss realized by dpfc was million  million of which was charged against the reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary  and million of which was otherwise reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
the million portion of the loss for decreased basic eps by for the average historical quarterly losses in dpfc have been approximately million per quarter over the past four quarters 
upon the retirement of the securitized notes  the company will recognize a gain in an amount approximately equal to any accumulated deficit of dpfc 
the securitized notes represent the obligations solely of dpfc 
point west did not guarantee repayment of the securitized notes and is not required to fund any principal or interest deficiencies thereunder 
year ended december  compared to year ended december and year ended december  compared to year ended december  earned discounts 
earned discounts on matured polices decreased to  in from  in  and decreased in from  in effective july   the company began recognizing earned discounts only upon receipt of proceeds on matured policies pursuant to the death of an insured 
the decrease in  therefore  probably would have been more pronounced if the company had been recognizing for the entire year of earned discounts only upon receipt of proceeds on matured policies 
the decreases are due primarily to fewer deaths of insureds and secondarily to a decrease in the size of the company s portfolio of policies 
during  earned discounts on matured policies were recognized on policies with a face value of million  compared to and policies with a face value of million and million in and  respectively 
in the first six months of  the earned discount was recognized on each purchased policy 
earned discounts on life insurance policies was million for the six months ended june  the company has not recognized any earned discounts in that manner since july  in addition  the company recognized  of earned discounts on prior maturities in such earned discounts were carried on the balance sheet at june  as unearned income which related to policies for which the company had collected the proceeds prior to the expected collection date 
because the company began recognizing earned discounts under a different method in july  earned disounts on prior maturities were recognized at the time of change in method and have not been recognized in or see method of accounting for viatical settlements 
as of december   the company held policies with an aggregate carrying value of million and an aggregate face value of million 
virtually all of the policies are pledged as security for the securitized notes 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  in from  in  and in from  in  as a result of lower cash balances attributable to dpfc 
the cash generated by dpfc is restricted under the indenture 
gain loss on assets sold 
the gain on assets sold decreased to  in from million in because a large portion of the sale proceeds from life insurance policies was collected during the first half of the company collected the sale proceeds on policies in compared to policies in the company collected the sale proceeds on policies in and recorded a net loss on assets sold of  in connection with these sales 
the realized gain loss was calculated based on the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value after giving effect to the provision for loss on sale of assets 
see cessation of viatical settlement business  sale of assets  name change 
other income 
components of other income include collections on policies of dividends  interest and paid up cash values  increases in face value of matured policies and refunds of premiums on matured policies

interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in  and in from  in as a result of principal repayments under the securitized notes 
average borrowings under the securitized notes were million in compared to million in and million in other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses increased  to  in from  in this increase was due primarily to an increase in life insurance policy premium costs 
however  because such premium costs were largely charged against the reserve for equity interest in wholly owned financing subsidiary until it was depleted in the third quarter of  the increase had a marginal effect on the company s net income relative to other general and administrative expenses increased  in from  in this increase was due primarily to a  increase in life insurance policy premium costs in compared to for the reasons discussed above  the increase in premium costs did not impact net income in in addition  the  annual fee paid to the trustee for the securitized notes was expensed in and provision for loss on assets held for sale 
the company recorded in a provision for loss on sale of assets totaling million based on management s estimate of proceeds from the sale of policies 
the provision equaled the difference between the carrying value of policies and those estimates 
the estimates were based on the life expectancies of the insureds covered by the policies  the estimated sale period and the prices obtained by the company in connection with other sales of policies 
in  the company recorded an additional provision in the amount of  in connection with the remaining policies not yet sold  based on management s revised best estimate of proceeds from the sale of such policies 
loss on investment in wholly owned financing subsidiary 
a reserve was recorded in in the amount of million to reflect the estimated loss of point west s entire equity interest in dpfc 
point west had an initial capital investment in dpfc of million and  through consolidation  an additional million of increased equity attributable to the earnings of dpfc

fourteen hill method of accounting for loans and debt and equity securities sfas requires marketable debt and equity securities to be classified into held to maturity  available for sale and trading categories

in connection with such initial public offering  fourteen hill s shares are automatically convertible and fourteen hill will hold  common shares of flashnet  after giving effect to a to stock split which was authorized to occur prior to the initial public offering 
if the flashnet initial public offering occurs  the flashnet shares will become marketable securities 
as a result  any unrealized gains or losses in such investment will be reflected as accumulated comprehensive income net unrealized investment gains losses in stockholders equity 
pursuant to a standard lock up agreement  fourteen hill will not be able to sell or otherwise dispose of its flashnet shares until six months after the initial public offering 
beginning in  because of the recent volatility of the stock market  particularly in internet and internet related stocks  point west has hedged a portion of its exposure and may increase its hedging activities to reduce its exposure to such volatility 
such hedging has included shorting stocks of certain competitors of the company s holdings 
however  under gaap it is unlikely that such hedging activities will constitute hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no

allegiance method of accounting for loans and debt and equity securities the company accounts for loans advanced by allegiance by accruing interest on outstanding balances 
at december  the company recorded an allowance for loan losses of  the allowance for loan losses is estimated by management based on a review of the loans and factors which in management s judgement deserve recognition under current economic conditions 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
although management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
at december   the company evaluated allegiance s one outstanding loan and determined that an allowance for loan losses was not necessary 
loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are capitalized and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield interest income in accordance with sfas the allegiance financing provides for short term floating rate debt that is expected to become long term fixed rate debt

as of the same date  dpfc had restricted cash of million  which cannot be accessed by point west except for reimbursement of costs incurred in connection with its activities as servicer under the indenture 
principal and interest payments on the securitized notes are payable solely from collections on policies pledged to secure the payment thereof and do not require point west to expend cash or obtain financing to satisfy such principal and interest obligations 
fourteen hill fourteen hill s activities have generally been supported by capital investments by point west 
during  point west contributed million to fourteen hill 
during  point west contributed an additional million to fourteen hill 
during the first two months of  point west has contributed an additional  to fourteen hill 
fourteen hill capital has an sba debenture license and  therefore  may be permitted to borrow up to million from the sba 
any borrowings bear interest at the rate for ten year debentures issued by sbic s and funded through public sales of certificates bearing the sba s guarantee debenture rate 
interest is payable semi annually 
in addition  there is a leverage fee of and a fee of per annum on the outstanding amount of debt 
among other requirements  an sbic with an sbic debenture license must maintain proper diversification of its portfolio 
this requirement generally means that in order to borrow funds from the sba  no single investment may exceed of the sbic s regulatory capital plus its net unrealized investment gains 
additionally  the portfolio must consist of a proper mix of debt and equity investments 
on july   fourteen hill capital borrowed million from the sba 
at present  fourteen hill capital is unable to borrow additional funds from the sba because two investments each represents an amount greater than of its regulatory capital plus its net unrealized investment gains and fourteen hill capital has negative retained earnings 
the company cannot determine when  if ever  it will be able to borrow additional funds from the sba 
in addition  if fourteen hill capital does not liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio or obtain additional regulatory capital  the sba may accelerate the repayment of the debenture 
the company believes that if its holdings in flashnet become marketable securities  the only reason it may not be able to borrow additional funds from the sba is that fourteen hill capital is not profitable 
fourteen hill may not have sufficient liquidity  at least in the short term  to grow its business 
allegiance at december   point west made the only capital contribution to allegiance capital in the amount of million 
on august   allegiance put in place the allegiance financing which may provide up to million solely to support any lending activities of allegiance 
the allegiance financing provides interim floating rate financing through august  the company anticipates that the allegiance financing will ultimately provide year fixed and floating rate financing for loans originated by allegiance 
however  if allegiance does not originate million in loans by august   the term certificates may not be issued and allegiance would be responsible for finding an alternative financing source to repay the interim financing 
as of december   allegiance had borrowed the principal amount of million under the allegiance financing 
see description of revolving certificates 
the company expects that the allegiance financing will provide sufficient funds to support allegiance s lending activities through august description of revolving certificates pursuant to the allegiance financing  a consortium of insurance companies the investors will provide funding of approximately million through august  on a non recourse revolving certificate basis to be used for the purchase or funding of loans originated by allegiance capital and transferred to allegiance funding 
upon the earlier of the incurrence of million of revolving certificates or august   such revolving certificates will be repaid through the issuance of term certificates with an approximate year maturity 
in addition  the allegiance financing provides a commitment to provide up to an additional million of funding through august  through year term loans 
in the event that term certificates are not issued by august   allegiance will be required to refinance any revolving certificates outstanding under the allegiance financing 
the allegiance financing contemplates the issuance of various classes of revolving and term certificates through allegiance trust i 
certificates receiving ratings are to be purchased by the investors  while allegiance funding will retain unrated certificates 
the revolving certificates received ratings from duff phelps credit rating co 
ranging from a to bb and it is anticipated that the term certificates  when and if issued  will also receive ratings from duff phelps 
allegiance trust i issued the class b r  class c r and class d r revolving certificates in the class c r certificates were issued in november in the principal amount of million and received a rating of bb from duff phelps 
the class b r certificates were issued in december in the principal amount of million and received a rating of bbb from duff phelps 
such certificates bear interest at a variable rate based on the one year us treasury rate plus a weighted average spread of 
the weighted average interest rate of the certificates at december  was 
allegiance initially retained the unrated class d r revolving certificate with a maximum aggregate principal amount of  this certificate represents the right to receive all excess cash flow from allegiance trust i 
allegiance also anticipates retaining unrated term certificates following retirement of revolving certificates 
because of allegiance s right to redeem the certificates if or less in principal amount of certificates is outstanding  the allegiance financing does not qualify for sale treatment under sfas accordingly  the allegiance financing will not receive gain on sale treatment under sfas the loans and any borrowings under the allegiance financing will be reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the allegiance financing  allegiance capital paid a  commitment fee when the funds were initially borrowed under the allegiance financing 
of such commitment fee   will be amortized over the expected life of the revolving certificates months and  will be amortized over the expected life of the allegiance financing years 
this allocation was based on an estimate of the portion of the commitment fee attributable to the revolving certificates and the term certificates 
allegiance s ability to borrow under the allegiance financing is based on the delivery of loans meeting certain eligibility criteria relating to loan level and pool level credit criteria  form of security and appropriate legal documentation 
the loan level credit criteria and security and documentation requirements generally follow allegiance s basic lending guidelines 
the pool level criteria create requirements with respect to a variety of parameters intended to achieve certain overall levels of credit quality and credit diversification

considerations under the investment company act of the investment company act of the act creates a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable generally to investment companies ie  companies engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities within the meaning of the act  whether or not those companies intend to be engaged primarily in such business 
there are various percentage of assets and income tests under the act the percentage tests that are relevant in considering whether a company is deemed to be an investment company 
companies that are subject to the act must register with the sec as investment companies and upon registration become subject to extensive regulation 
nonetheless  the company believes it is not engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities within the meaning of the act and the rules of the sec promulgated thereunder and does not believe that it should be deemed to be an investment company under the percentage tests 
in addition  the company does not believe it holds itself out as an investment company 
however  the company believes that it may exceed the percentage tests in the future as a result of the following allegiance has not grown its commercial lending business as quickly as the company had expected  the company has been unable to commence or acquire other complementary financial services businesses as rapidly as it had hoped  and the success of fourteen hill  which holds a number of investment securities  has exceeded expectations 
the bulk of investment securities held by the company have been acquired since january the aggregate value of these investments has increased substantially since the purchase dates 
in particular  fourteen hill will hold  shares of flashnet common stock  after giving effect to the to stock split and assuming the initial public offering of flashnet is consummated 
flashnet has announced its intention to complete its initial public offering in the middle of march 
based on preliminary price indications  the company expects the value of the flashnet shares that it owns to increase dramatically if the initial public offering occurs 
given the value of the company s other assets  the company believes that the increased value of the flashnet shares may cause the company to exceed the percentage tests even if those percentage tests have not yet been exceeded 
the company intends to pursue an aggressive strategy to ensure that it is not deemed to be an investment company 
some elements of this strategy  however  may at least in the short term materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations  or both 
the elements of this strategy  which are subject to the risks described below involve pursuing the growth of new operating businesses  by acquisition or internal development  continuing to develop allegiance s commercial lending business  and disposing of investment securities and or restricting the growth of fourteen hill s business 
growth of new business the company is seeking advice from financial advisors to assist it in its strategy of developing or acquiring new operating businesses that do not involve investment securities 
although the company intends to pursue businesses which are complementary to the company s current businesses  these businesses may not necessarily involve financial services 
these businesses will be operating entities which do not own  trade or hold any significant amount of investment securities 
the company may not find any suitable businesses to acquire or develop on terms acceptable to the company 
in addition  the company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses 
finally  any new businesses may not contribute positively to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
accelerating the growth of allegiance the company will use all reasonable efforts to grow the commercial lending business of allegiance 
however  the growth of allegiance is dependent on the market s acceptance of the product offerings and services of allegiance  allegiance s continued ability to raise financing for its activities  allegiance s ability to find suitable creditworthy borrowers and competitive pressures in the lending industry 
disposing of investment securities limiting growth of fourteen hill the company may determine that it must dispose of investment securities to avoid being deemed to be an investment company 
therefore  the dispositions may occur at times and on terms that would not maximize the value of these investments 
in addition  the dispositions may result in disadvantageous tax consequences 
the company intends to use any proceeds of any sale to reduce debt and support its working capital 
pending final use  proceeds will be invested in u 
s government securities 
the company may also determine that it needs to limit the growth of fourteen hill s business to avoid being an investment company under the act 
limiting fourteen hill s growth may materially adversely affect the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
year readiness disclosure the year issue refers to a wide variety of potential computer program processing and functionality issues that may arise from the inability of computer programs to properly process date sensitive information relating to the year  years thereafter and to a lesser degree the year any of the company s computers  computer programs and administration equipment or products that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if any of the company s systems or equipment that have date sensitive software use only two digits  system failures or miscalculations may result causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or send and receive electronic data with third parties or engage in similar normal business activities 
the following discussion constitutes a year readiness disclosure 
the company expects to spend approximately  to  in the aggregate to modify its computer information systems enabling proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond year compliant 
during  the company made an assessment of year compliant issues and determined that it needed to modify or replace certain third party computer hardware and software 
as the company has implemented solutions to the year compliant issues  in some circumstances it has determined that replacing existing systems  hardware  or equipment may be more efficient and also provide additional functionality 
the company has completed the majority of such modifications and replacements 
through december   the company had incurred year compliant costs of approximately  of which  has been capitalized 
the company does not believe the amounts expected to be expensed over the next year will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that actual costs i will not materially exceed expected costs and ii will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
the company is currently assessing its electronic office equipment such as the phone system  copiers  fax machines  printers  and the like to determine if such equipment is date sensitive and will require upgrades 
the company is also assessing the readiness of its business critical spreadsheets and customized databases and plans to make modifications of those systems as necessary 
during  the company will test and make any system refinements that may be needed 
the company has begun assessing the readiness of external entities  such as vendors  suppliers  investments and financial institutions which interface with the company and plans to have this assessment complete by june  the company plans to determine whether those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company plans to assess the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to properly remediate their computer systems 
the company s year team is made up of three internal staff members 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be year compliant on a timely basis 
although the company believes it is unlikely  there can be no assurance that the failure of the company or a third party on which it is dependent to be year compliant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  prospects  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s contingency plans  if year modifications do not work or are not ready by year  relies significantly on manual procedures and record keeping 
all files are expected to be adequately backed up as of december  and to be available to facilitate manual record keeping 
adequate hard copy reports of balances and transactions as of december  will also be available to provide a complete manual system of accounting and inventory control  if required 
subsequent to year  manual systems will continue to be in place to mitigate the risk of lost information due to any unforeseen interruptions that may occur as a result of year issues arising after january  nonetheless  there can be no assurance that the company s contingency plan will effectively mitigate any year failures or that such contingency plan would not itself materially adversely effect the company s financial condition or results of operations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio 
the company s exposure to market risk arises primarily from fourteen hill s investments in the stock of public and private companies  fixed rate loans and debt investments made by allegiance and fourteen hill and allegiance s variable rate debt 
the company s management believes the company s risk management and hedging practices result in carefully managed market exposure 
the company has investment holdings in various companies 
due to the varying nature of these investments  it is difficult to correlate the effects of the market to a particular market index 
the effects of the market are reviewed by management on an individual investment by investment basis 
beginning in  because of the recent volatility of the stock market  particularly in internet and internet related stocks  point west has hedged a portion of its exposure and may increase its hedging activities to reduce its exposure to such volatility 
such hedging has included shorting stocks of certain competitors of the company s holdings 
however  under gaap it is unlikely that such hedging activities will constitute hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for futures contracts 
therefore  such hedging activities will be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 
allegiance s variable rate debt consist of trust certificates totaling million which bear interest based on the one year us treasury rate plus a weighted average spread of 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below represents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates for the allegiance loans outstanding at december  thereafter fixed rate loans       average interest rates the company hedges its interest rate exposure related to the loans made by allegiance because the interest rate at which allegiance anticipates issuing term certificates will be set in the future at some point before august   when approximately million of loans have been originated 
allegiance utilizes futures contracts to hedge certain interest rate exposure between the time of origination of the loans and the issuance of term certificates 
the company sold year treasury notes to hedge such interest rate risk 
in connection with the allegiance financing  point west agreed to provide additional cash to allegiance trust i in the event that monthly libor interest rates exceed 
the amount of cash will be a function of several variables including the monthly libor interest rate and the amount of revolving class a r certificates outstanding under allegiance trust i
