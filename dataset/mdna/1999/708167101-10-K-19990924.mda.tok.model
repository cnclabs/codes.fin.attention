item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in july  pennfed became the savings and loan holding company of the bank 
currently  the results of operations of the company are primarily those of the bank and its subsidiaries and the trust 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses and operating expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
management strategy management s primary goal continues to be to improve profitability  while continuing to manage risks  including interest rate risk  so as to enhance stockholder value  and to foster and maintain customer confidence 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing core deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  vi improving non interest income and vii controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
the company will continue to emphasize originating and purchasing traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located in new jersey 
the company originated or purchased million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans on residential real estate which totaled million or of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  during fiscal  in an effort to mitigate the effects of low interest rates and a flat yield curve  the company sold approximately million of low coupon  longer duration one to four family mortgage loans 
in periods of a higher interest rate and steeper yield curve environment  such as the beginning of fiscal  loan sale activity is expected to be reduced 
the level of such activity will continue to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk and long term profitability objectives 
increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to one to four family residential first mortgage lending  the company plans to continue its emphasis on commercial and multi family and consumer lending 
such loans reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family and consumer loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintaining asset quality 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
the company focuses on strong underwriting and collection efforts and aggressive marketing of real estate owned properties 
in addition  the company has occasionally restructured loans in order to return the loan to a performing status 
as a result  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets was at june  increasing core deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
the company will continue to emphasize growth in lower costing core deposits  primarily checking deposits 
checking deposits increased million  or  in fiscal and million  or  in fiscal managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than weekly to price loan and deposit products and monthly to develop  implement and review strategies and policies to manage interest rate risk 
the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan and deposit products  including the focus on the origination and purchase of first mortgage products with shorter terms to maturity and or with adjustable rate features  as well as the origination of commercial and multi family real estate and consumer loans which generally have shorter expected average lives or reprice at shorter intervals than one to four family residential first mortgage products 
the company has also engaged in one to four family whole mortgage loan sales whereby longer term fixed rate conventional loans have been sold to reduce the duration of its fixed rate loan portfolios 
in addition  the company has purchased government agency or callable securities with short to intermediate average lives or which have adjustable rate features 
furthermore  as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized longer term certificates of deposit and checking products and utilized intermediate term borrowings 
the company has also periodically engaged in intermediate term interest rate swaps designed to extend the maturities of short term certificates of deposit to three to five years 
see interest rate sensitivity analysis and asset liability strategy 
improving non interest income 
the company continues to seek additional ways of improving non interest income 
total service charges and other non interest income  excluding the net gain on sales of loans and real estate operations  reflected a  or  increase for fiscal compared to fiscal  due to growth in checking accounts and earnings from the bank s investment services at penn federal program 
the program gives customers convenient access to financial consulting advisory services and related uninsured non deposit investment and insurance products at local branch offices 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  which include ongoing reviews of staffing levels  facilities and operations 
the company s ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets was for the year ended june  interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer  the lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer and the customer support operations group executive  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year if their stated interest rates are at or above current market rates 
if the stated interest rate is below current market rates  these callable securities are assumed to be called at an estimated average life of approximately years 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by call date or contractual maturity date 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes  based on historical information  that million or of savings accounts at june   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the remaining savings accounts are assumed to roll off over the first eighteen months 
transaction accounts  excluding money market accounts  are assumed to roll off after five years 
money market accounts are assumed to be variable accounts and are reported as repricing within six months 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit

the company s negative gap position widened from june  as a result of a recent rise in market rates and a steeper treasury yield curve than was present at the end of fiscal throughout most of fiscal  a historically flat yield curve and low market rates supported strong residential lending activity that was primarily focused on long term  fixed rate products 
high levels of prepayments accompanied the low market rates and asset cashflows remained robust 
to mitigate the negative impact such lending activity had on interest rate risk  the company periodically sold newly originated  low coupon fixed rate loans into the secondary market 
proceeds from such sales were partially reinvested in callable government agency securities with final maturities of years or less  but initially callable within one year and periodically thereafter  and partially to reduce borrowings 
growth in short term certificates of deposit outpaced activity in intermediate term products as depositors were generally unwilling to invest in longer term products in the flat interest rate environment 
at june   market rates were higher and the treasury yield curve was steeper than was seen previously in fiscal as a result  prepayment expectations have declined and asset cash flows have lengthened 
in addition  the majority of the company s callable agency security portfolio  previously assumed to be called within one year  has been extended to its average life 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is also regularly monitored by management through selected interest rate risk irr measures  including an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a low initial npv ratio or high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the change in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure was 
though npv is measured on an unconsolidated basis for regulatory purposes  it is managed on a consolidated basis 
as of june   the company s initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as investments  intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions and  as such  generally result in lower levels of presumed interest rate risk ie  higher post shock npv ratio and lower sensitivity measure than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s unconsolidated irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was  the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
at june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was  the post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was 
in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would decrease from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company has focused on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years  and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years 
the company has emphasized the origination of variable rate home equity lines and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company has periodically and  during fiscal more routinely  sold a portion of its one to four family whole mortgage loan portfolio in an effort to shorten the average life and duration  as well as to mitigate prepayment risk and reduce borrowings 
million of such loans were sold in fiscal the level of such activity will continue to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk and long term profitability objectives 
in periods of a higher interest rate and steeper yield curve environment  loan sale activity is expected to be reduced 
the company has purchased government agency guaranteed investments with final maturities within years which are initially callable within one year and periodically thereafter 
such investments are expected to be called prior to their final maturities 
the company may continue to purchase such investments  as well as government agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities when yield and duration analysis point to such purchases as favarable vehicles in managing interest rate risk 
the company has emphasized the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate and longer term borrowings and interest rate swaps  subject to market conditions 
the company has also emphasized growth in core deposit accounts as such funds are lower cost alternatives  are relatively stable and  thus  have a longer duration and assist in strengthening customer relationships 
during fiscal  each of the strategies noted above was employed to reduce the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
periodic one to four family loan sales coupled with lower market rates  increased prepayments and a flat treasury yield curve resulted in a decline in one to four family first mortgage loans between june  and june  despite the sale of million of fixed rate one to four family first mortgage loans  such balances increased million in fiscal adjustable rate one to four family first mortgage loan balances declined million in fiscal  despite the origination and purchase of million of adjustable rate loans 
commercial and multi family real estate loans increased million from june   fixed rate loans declined  while adjustable rate loans increased 
consumer loan balances increased million or in fiscal approximately of the growth in consumer loans occurred in prime based home equity lines of credit  while the remainder occurred in products of significantly shorter duration than one to four family residential mortgages 
additionally  medium and long term funds increased million from june   while short term funds decreased million 
this shift was supported through the use of interest rate swaps  designed to synthetically lengthen the maturities of short term deposits  as well as growth in demand deposit accounts  fhlb of new york advances and other borrowings 
generally  the investment policy of the company is to invest funds not utilized in its lending activities or required for other corporate purposes among various categories of investments and maturities based upon the company s asset liability management policies 
investments generally include us treasury and government agency securities and mortgage backed securities 
the company s cost of funds responds more rapidly to changes in interest rates than its yield on earning assets due to the shorter terms of its funding portfolios 
consequently  the results of operations are influenced by the levels of short term interest rates 
the company offers a range of maturities on its deposit products at competitive rates and monitors the maturities on an ongoing basis 
additionally  the company emphasizes and promotes its savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  and certificates of deposit with varying maturities through five years  principally within its primary market areas 
the balances of savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  which represented approximately of total deposits at june   tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates than certificates of deposit balances 
management will continue to monitor and employ such strategies  as necessary  in conjunction with its overall strategic objectives

the net loss from real estate operations was  for the year ended june  compared to a net loss from real estate operations of  for the prior year 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses were million for the year ended june  compared to million for the prior year

income tax expense

the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was 
excluding the effects of the one time saif recapitalization assessment  the effective tax rate was for the year ended june  year the concern comprising the year issue has its basis in the fact that many existing computer programs have traditionally used only two digits in many date fields to identify the year 
the century representation has been largely assumed 
as a century change rapidly approaches  any misinterpretation of the proper meaning could cause logic and other software errors in various applications 
year readiness means being able to clearly discern and traverse the century boundary in all applications 
it is not  however  just a computer issue 
building  communications and environmental systems are also involved 
the issue is further compounded by the degree to which other entities  such as bank customers and suppliers  are successful in addressing this same issue 
the year issue affects virtually all organizations globally 
penn federal has been taking  as have most banking institutions  a proactive stance on this issue for several years 
a formal year project plan the year plan was prepared and approved by the company s board of directors 
the year plan identified different phases awareness  assessment  renovation  testing and contingency planning 
the board of directors continues to be updated on a monthly basis as to the status of all phases  with an independent verification of progress completed on a quarterly basis 
the ots is also reviewing all of its regulated institutions for year preparedness 
a task force  with representatives from all divisions within the bank  was assembled to implement the year plan  under the direction of an executive vice president and a senior vice president 
the task force engaged in a wide range of associated tasks 
these included informing bank personnel about the complexity of the issue  assessing its impact upon penn federal systems and applications and arranging for the remediation of affected items 
as the bank primarily runs software purchased from a few key vendors  the task force met and worked closely with those vendors and suppliers to ensure a smooth transition into the next millennium 
by following a carefully prescribed year plan  as of june  all mission critical systems  including interfaces to the main systems  have been completely renovated and tested 
significant progress is being made to inform customers of the company s year preparedness 
the company intends to continue to test systems and plans throughout the remainder of  as well as sponsor regional seminars for customers 
due to variables outside the direct control of the company  contingency planning is an ongoing process 
members of the task force have responsibility for identifying a contingency plan for the different areas of software tested 
this type of contingency planning is critical because  regardless of the validation of systems  the potential still exists that the systems will not operate as expected 
if software for certain critical systems does not operate and the current vendor is unable to supply year compliant software upgrades  the use of an alternative vendor could be required to be pursued  at additional cost to the company 
contingency planning also includes other factors  such as potential disruptions in vital utility services  which could negatively impact the company s ability to service its customers 
the company has developed  and the board of directors has reviewed and approved  a business resumption contingency plan 
this plan focuses on and attempts to anticipate potential problems that may arise  and provides alternative contingency planning strategies to mitigate risk 
the business resumption contingency plan identifies actions that could help reduce the likelihood or lessen the impact of a year problem  as well as identifies the appropriate response actions to be taken in the event that a problem does occur 
the company is continuing to review and assess the year status of its larger borrowers 
all commercial and multi family loans have been evaluated for year exposure through an independent review process 
as part of the current credit approval process  all new and renewed commercial and multi family loans are evaluated for year risk 
the company has requested that each of its larger borrowers provide information regarding the nature of steps being taken by the borrowers to address their own year issues 
the cost for the year effort incurred in fiscal was  additional future costs are not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations and are estimated to be  no additional expenditures are currently anticipated for hardware or software upgrades 
the estimated remaining costs are expected to cover any ongoing testing and contingency planning 
the actual and estimated expenditures do not include manpower costs of company personnel associated with the task force  who retain their individual operational responsibilities in addition to year duties 
the costs are based upon management s analysis of the information currently available to it 
no assurance can be given that issues relating to the year will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and borrowings from the fhlb of new york 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and early loan repayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
the company has competitively set rates on deposit products for selected terms and  when necessary  has supplemented deposits with longer term or less expensive alternative sources of funds 
federal regulations require the bank to maintain minimum levels of liquid assets 
the required percentage has varied from time to time based upon economic conditions and savings flows

liquid assets for purposes of this ratio include cash  accrued interest receivable  certain time deposits  us treasury and government agencies and other securities and obligations generally having remaining maturities of less than five years 
all mortgage backed securities are includable in liquid assets  as well

management believes that loan repayments and other sources of funds will be adequate to meet the company s foreseeable liquidity needs 
during fiscal  the company s cash needs were provided by operating activities  primarily from proceeds from the sales of loans 
during fiscal  the cash provided was principally used for investing activities  which included the purchase of investment securities and the origination and purchase of loans 
in addition to cash provided by operating activities  the company s fiscal and cash needs were provided by increased deposits  an increase in advances from the fhlb of new york and other borrowings and principal repayments of mortgage backed securities 
furthermore  during fiscal  proceeds from the trust preferred securities offering  maturities of investment securities and sales of loans contributed to meeting the company s cash needs
