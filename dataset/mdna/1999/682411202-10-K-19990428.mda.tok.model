the company also lowered its distribution and merchandising costs as a percentage of net sales when compared to fiscal through higher levels of sales and efficiencies achieved in its distribution center 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal versus fiscal sg a expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal the significant decrease in sg a expenses is primarily due to achieving cost containment goals  including reducing total payroll expense  established in the company s restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal although total payroll decreased  average salaries and wages in the company s stores increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase  affecting primarily part time associates  was due to an increase in the average hourly wage rate  which was partially offset by a decrease in average store hours 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced a restructuring plan which identified low volume  underperforming stores for closing 
a substantial number of these stores were closed by january  certain of these stores are no longer under consideration for closing due to a significant improvement in performance since the announcement of the plan 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a favorable adjustment to pre tax income of  to reverse the estimated cost  recorded in fiscal  of closing these stores 
store rent and related expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal store rent and related expenses for fiscal decreased as a percentage of net sales due to the leverage provided by higher year over year sales as well as aggressively closing underperforming stores during fiscal average store rent and related expenses increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in average store rent and related expenses is primarily due to the company s store expansion strategy of opening larger  higher volume stores  and thus leasing more costly sites with higher rents while closing older  underperforming stores which generally have lower average rent costs 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the leverage provided by higher year over year sales as well as a decrease in the number of stores open during fiscal versus fiscal interest expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal due to the increase in net sales year over year 
interest expense in dollars increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings in fiscal versus fiscal in order to maintain levels of inventory necessary to support the increased sales 
the effective income tax provision rate for fiscal was compared to the effective income tax benefit rate of in fiscal the change in the company s effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a favorable valuation allowance adjustment for fiscal compared to fiscal because management cannot be assured that certain net operating loss carryforwards  credit carryforwards and net cumulative temporary differences for us federal and state income tax purposes will be fully utilized or realized  valuation allowances have been provided for a portion of the net deferred income tax asset 
management estimates that the company s effective income tax rate will be approximately in fiscal  however  if sufficient levels of profitability are achieved  the effective income tax rate may decrease because of a possible favorable adjustment of some or all of the valuation allowance 
outlook sales through the first ten weeks of fiscal are ahead of planned levels through the corresponding time period due  in part  to favorable trends in the women s apparel industry as a whole  as well as the company s merchandise strategy of offering goods that emphasize quality  value and fashion 
sales during the corresponding time period in fiscal were hindered by slow receipts of key merchandise 
during fiscal  the company intends to focus its efforts on improving sales in existing stores while maintaining its margin and cost containment targets 
as part of this strategy  the company plans to continue to monitor the merchandise mix and demographic profiles of its stores 
the company also plans to increase the size of certain highly productive stores and expand the test of men s apparel sales to approximately stores 
the company plans to open approximately new stores in existing markets and close approximately underperforming stores in fiscal average store rent and related expenses are expected to increase in fiscal due to the location and the increase in the average square footage of stores planned to open in fiscal and the closing of older  lower volume stores 
management will seek to leverage these increases through improved average store sales volume 
also  the company has approximately existing leases that expire or have initial lease terms containing lessee renewal options which may be exercised in fiscal management believes that the company will not experience a material increase in aggregate store rents as a result of renewal options or negotiating new lease terms for such locations

the company opened stores during fiscal  relocated stores and closed underperforming stores 
during fiscal  the company implemented its previously announced strategy to offer additional categories of merchandise at price points other than its traditional retail price 
however  during the implementation of this strategy  management believes that the company confused its customers by introducing too many items at price points higher than its previous price point 
in addition  these higher priced items were offered at too many price points 
this combination of too many higher priced items at too many price points had a negative effect on markdowns and sg a expenses as discussed below 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adjusted its pricing and merchandising strategy to increase the portion of its merchandise priced at or less 
also  the company established clear policies to limit its higher price point items to only that merchandise which had been determined to be clearly desired by its customers and could not be offered for  thus focusing its merchandising strategy on quality  value and selection 
such higher priced items are offered at discernable price points up to gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from a significantly higher level of markdowns taken during fiscal higher levels of markdowns were taken during the third quarter of fiscal in an effort to clear transitional merchandise which was not fashion right 
higher levels of markdowns were taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to clear inventory as part of the company s initiative to aggressively close underperforming stores and to adjust price points in certain merchandise categories downward as part of the company s strategy to offer more of its merchandise at or below 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal when expressed as a percentage of net sales  corporate office and store operating costs increased 
these increases resulted primarily from increased marketing costs as a result of producing in store signs and posters to promote the new merchandising strategy and to display the many new price points and increased equipment lease costs in the company s corporate offices 
average salaries and wages in the company s stores increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase  affecting primarily part time associates  was due to an increase in average store hours and to increases in the federal minimum wage which were effective in october and september management allocated a higher number of average payroll hours per store in fiscal compared to fiscal because management believed introduction of the higher price points would necessitate additional training and a higher level of customer service 
in response to lower than expected operating results  the company announced a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal the plan included initiatives which were designed to return the company to profitability by lowering operating costs  redeploying assets and curtailing the number of new store openings until the company s existing stores were operating profitably 
under the restructuring plan the company planned to close approximately low volume  underperforming stores and eliminate approximately positions 
the company recorded a one time charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal to cover costs associated with the plan 
the total charge included costs to close stores  such as the noncash write off of fixed assets and store supplies of  lease buyouts of approximately  and employee severance  outplacement costs and other miscellaneous expenses of approximately  store rent and related expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal average store rent and related expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the continuation of the company s store expansion strategy of increasing the proportion of larger  higher volume stores and thus entering more costly sites with higher rents  and the closing of older  underperforming stores which had lower average rent costs 
depreciation and amortization expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted primarily from fixed asset additions associated with new store openings in fiscal and to software upgrades in the company s corporate offices 
interest expense was of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal this increase in interest expense resulted from a combination of slightly higher average borrowings and a higher average borrowing rate in fiscal compared to fiscal the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the recording of valuation allowances related to the company s tax loss and credit carryforwards in fiscal inflation during its three most recent fiscal years  the company believes that the impact of inflation has not been material to its financial condition or results of operations 
occasionally  the company may experience slight increases in the average purchase price per unit of merchandise  however  such increases also reflect the impact of an increase in the quality of goods purchased in addition to minimal inflationary factors 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary needs for liquidity and capital have been to fund its new store expansion and the related growth in merchandise inventories 
the company has obtained credit facilities which  together with cash provided by operations  are expected to meet the liquidity and capital needs during the period of the agreements 
the company s credit facilities consist of a revolving credit facility to meet the company s short term liquidity needs  a mortgage loan collateralized by the company s corporate offices and distribution center and letter of credit facilities to accommodate the company s needs to purchase merchandise inventories from foreign sources 
collectively  the company s credit facilities contain certain financial and non financial covenants with which the company was in compliance at january  a summary of the company s credit facilities follows

net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in merchandise inventories  and a decrease in noncash charges including deferred income taxes and costs associated with disposal of property and equipment  and partially offset by an improvement in the company s year over year results of operations  including a favorable adjustment in fiscal to the estimated costs of fiscal s restructuring plan 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise inventories and increases in noncash charges for depreciation and costs associated with the disposal of property and equipment due to closing stores as part of the restructuring plan which more than offset the company s net loss 
total merchandise inventories were   and  at january   january  and february   respectively 
total merchandise inventories increased at january  compared to january  the increase in total merchandise inventories is attributable to all portions of merchandise inventories including merchandise in transit to the company s distribution center from its vendors  merchandise inventories held in the distribution center and in store inventories 
most of this year over year inventory increase was the result of purchasing and distributing spring and summer merchandise in order to increase inventory to an appropriate level the january  inventory level was abnormally low 
it is management s intent to purchase goods in an opportunistic manner  as well as in a timely manner  in order to make smooth transitions between each season 
total merchandise inventories decreased at january  compared to february  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in merchandise in transit to the company s distribution center from its vendors 
most of this year over year in transit decrease related to lower levels of imported goods 
since late fiscal  the company has relied heavily on sourcing inventory through opportunistic purchases from domestic vendors 
in fiscal  import purchases including freight and duty were of total purchases compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the level and source of inventories are subject to fluctuations because of the company s opportunistic buying strategy and prevailing business conditions 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was   and  respectively  and was primarily used for leasehold improvements and equipment for new stores opened each year  as well as information technology expenditures including software and hardware upgrades 
net cash of  was used in financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of the repayment of the company s mortgage loan facility and the payment of capital lease obligations which exceeded the net borrowings from the company s revolving credit facilities

net cash of  was provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily as a result of net borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility and net borrowings on the company s term loan facilities 
in fiscal  the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  most of which will be used to open new stores  remodel  re fixture  expand and relocate existing stores  and invest in information technology 
the company s liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future are expected to be met principally through cash provided by operations and the use of its credit facilities 
if deemed by management to be in the best interest of the company  additional long term debt  equity  capital leases  or other permanent financing may be considered 
market risk and risk management policies the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting its credit arrangements  including a variable rate revolving credit facility and a fixed rate mortgage loan agreement  which may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows 
the company seeks to minimize its interest rate risk through its day to day operating and financing activities 
the company does not engage in speculative or derivative financial or trading activities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse change increase in interest rates relating to the company s revolving credit facility for fiscal would have decreased pre tax income by approximately  for the same time period 
due to the fixed rate nature of the mortgage loan agreement  a hypothetical basis point adverse change decrease in interest rates would have increased the estimated fair value of the company s mortgage loan agreement by approximately  at january   but would have had no effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows for fiscal year issues state of readiness the company began identifying its major systems and software vendors susceptible to year issues during its preparedness evaluation in fiscal during fiscal  a formal steering committee was assembled from throughout the company to ensure a smooth transition into the year the company has separated its year efforts into five phases the year plan i awareness and identification of issues relating to the year  ii analysis of the impact on and risk to the company s software  hardware and the services provided by the company s vendors  iii performance of the work necessary to change or upgrade programs and files including installation of software and or hardware  iv testing and certification of systems to assure compliance  including disaster recovery testing  and v implementation of systems 
because the company uses a variety of internally developed and third party software  certain tasks of various phases of the year plan are being performed simultaneously 
the company anticipates that all five phases will be complete and its major systems will be year compliant by the summer of like other companies  the company relies upon third parties for its operations including  but not limited to  suppliers of merchandise  software  telephone service  electric power  water and financial services 
as part of this program  the company has a formal vendor year compliance program in place 
the company has identified and assigned various levels of risk to third party vendors associated with the company 
the company has received responses from all the vendors identified as critical to its operations 
each has indicated that it expects to be year compliant in a timely manner 
during the course of fiscal  the company will continue its vendor compliance efforts focusing on the remaining  less critical vendors in order of their assigned levels of risk 
cost the company is primarily using internal resources to identify  test  upgrade and replace its year sensitive systems 
the company s major systems  including its merchandise management system  its point of sale system  its inventory and general ledger system and its payroll system  have been due for upgrades in order to maintain vendor support 
therefore  the company would be devoting the efforts of its internal resources to some or all of these projects through the normal course of business even if the year issues had not existed 
the company also continues to replace any non compliant software and hardware as necessary 
during fiscal  the cost of these incidental software and hardware replacements was considerably less than the expected amount of  the cost of these incidental software and hardware replacements is expected to be less than  in fiscal risks and contingency planning management expects that the company will substantially complete implementation of the year plan by the summer of and will continue to monitor its systems through the remainder of the year  but gives no assurance that unforeseen difficulties which could alter the date of completion of the year plan will not occur while performing upgrades  installations  testing and implementation 
in addition  as part of a worst case scenario  if the year plan is not successful in a timely manner  the company s third party vendors are not year compliant in a timely manner  and or if the company s supply of merchandise or ability to distribute its merchandise to its stores is adversely affected  the year issues may have a material adverse impact on the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows of the company 
also  possible interruptions in services such as electric power and telephone could occur in certain geographic areas  thereby temporarily closing some of the company s stores 
in addition  any general economic disruption caused by year issues could adversely affect customer demand 
the company intends to mitigate its year risk by completing implementation of the year plan by the summer of  permitting time to monitor compliance as well as to conduct disaster recovery tests 
the company intends to mitigate its risk of temporarily closed stores due to possible interruptions in service such as electric power and telephone through the use of business interruption insurance  which it currently carries  and uses from time to time to protect itself from temporary closings due to weather related interruptions 
the company plans to continue to develop its contingency plans during the completion of the remaining phases of its year plan
