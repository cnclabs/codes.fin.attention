item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
inhale s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview since its inception in july  inhale has been engaged in the development of a pulmonary system for the delivery of macromolecules and other drugs for systemic and local lung applications 
inhale has been unprofitable since inception and expects to incur significant and increasing additional operating losses over the next several years primarily due to increasing research and development expenditures and expansion of manufacturing facilities 
to date  inhale has not sold any products and does not anticipate receiving revenue from product sales or royalties for at least the next several years 
for the period from inception through december   inhale incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
inhale s sources of working capital have been equity financings  financings of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  interest earned on investments of cash  and revenues from short term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts 
inhale typically has been compensated for research and development expenses incurred during initial feasibility work as well as for work performed under collaborative arrangements 
partners that enter into collaborative agreements generally pay for research and development expenses and make additional payments to inhale as inhale achieves certain key milestones 
these additional payments are intended to fund the continued development of the company s technology 
inhale expects to receive royalties from its partners based on revenues received from product sales  and to receive revenue from the manufacturing of powders and the supply of devices 
in certain cases  inhale may enter into collaborative agreements under which inhale s partners would manufacture powders or supply inhalation devices  thereby potentially limiting one or more sources of revenue for inhale 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  inhale  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products utilizing its pulmonary drug delivery system 
there can be no assurance that inhale will be able to generate revenue from commercial products or generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
results of operations years ended december   and contract research revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in from levels and in from levels 
costs of contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in operating costs and expenses 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily due to the increase in activities under inhale s existing collaborative agreement with pfizer 
the increase in activity under the pfizer collaboration was primarily related to manufacturing scale up and clinical supply production 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining new collaborative agreements  timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses represent proprietary research expenses as well as the costs related to contract research revenue and include salaries and benefits of scientific and development personnel  clinical manufacturing costs  laboratory supplies  consulting services  facilities  costs of obtaining intellectual property protection for inhale s technologies and expenses associated with the development of manufacturing processes 
the million increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily attributable to the development of infrastructure necessary to manufacture the company s products on a late stage clinical scale 
the million increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily attributed to continued expansion of research activities resulting from an increase in the number of projects and the hiring of additional scientific personnel required to support the increased number of projects 
inhale expects research and development spending to increase over the next few years as inhale expands its development efforts under collaborative agreements and plans  builds and scales up a late stage clinical and early commercial manufacturing facility 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in from and the million increase in from were due primarily to costs associated with supporting inhale s increased research efforts including administrative staffing  business development activities and marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase over the next few years as inhale expands its research  development and manufacturing activities 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in from was due to inhale maintaining larger cash and investment balances 
the increase in interest income in from was primarily a result of inhale receiving research funding and milestone payments from collaborative partners  the completion of a private placement of inhale s common stock in february which raised net proceeds of million as well as the completion of a public offering of inhale s common stock in november which raised net proceeds of million 
at december   inhale had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitation provided for by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources inhale has financed its operations primarily through public and private placements of its equity securities  contract research revenues  interest income earned on its investments of cash and financing of equipment acquisitions 
in its initial public offering completed may  inhale raised net proceeds of approximately million and raised additional net proceeds of million in its public offering completed in march on february  inhale completed a private placement of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
in november inhale completed a public offering of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
in may  inhale obtained a million line of credit which may be drawn upon to finance the purchases of equipment and facility improvements 
as of december   inhale had not drawn on this line of credit 
the line of credit expires in may inhale secured a million loan in november to also finance the purchases of equipment and facility improvements 
in december  inhale completed a private placement of its common stock  selling million newly issued shares for net proceeds of million 
at december   inhale had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
inhale s operations used cash of million  provided cash of million and used cash of million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts differed from inhale s net operating losses in these periods principally due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  depreciation expenses and deferred revenue 
additionally  in inhale recorded a non cash transaction of  in connection with the completion of two licensing agreements 
inhale purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase for the year ended december  is primarily due to the build out of inhale s manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters located in san carlos  california 
in addition  the company acquired land adjacent to the current facility for approximately million which will be used to support future expansion 
inhale expects its cash requirements to increase due to expected increases in expenses related to the further research and development of its technologies resulting from a larger number of projects  development of drug formulations  process development for the manufacture and filling of powders and devices  marketing and general and administrative costs 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  increases in personnel and personnel related costs  purchases of capital equipment  inhalation device prototype construction and facilities expansion  including the planning and building of a late stage clinical and early stage commercial manufacturing facility 
inhale believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  together with interest income and possible additional equipment financing  will be sufficient to meet its operating expense and capital expenditure requirements at least through the first half of however  inhale s capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its research and development arrangements  progress with pre clinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scale up of inhale s powder processing and packaging technologies  the timing and cost of its late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to satisfy its long term needs  inhale intends to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to inhale on favorable terms  if at all 
year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year yk problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation may be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to 
the issue is whether systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to if the company s software and firmware with date sensitive functions are not yk compliant  they may recognize a date with as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  interruptions in manufacturing operations  a temporary inability to process transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to conduct a comprehensive review of its systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the yk problem and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the issue by the end of the scope of the yk effort includes information technology it such as software and hardware  non it systems or embedded technology such as microcontrollers contained in various manufacturing and lab equipment  environmental and safety systems  facilities and utilities  and the yk readiness of key third parties such as suppliers and financial institutions 
a multi step yk readiness plan has been developed for its internal systems 
this plan includes the following elements awareness raising the company s awareness of the yk issue  discovery keeping an inventory and monitoring the compliance status of key financial  informational and operations systems subject to yk issues  assessment determining both the business impact of noncompliance and the likelihood of noncompliance from each of the entities in the inventory  validation remediation the process of validating entities to ascertain compliance and remediate non compliant entities 
as of december  the company had completed the awareness  discovery and assessment phases of the plan 
the company has initiated formal communication with significant vendors and suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own yk issues 
suppliers of hardware  software or other products that might contain embedded processors were requested to provide information regarding yk compliance status of their products 
the company will continue to seek information from non responsive suppliers and plans to contact replacement vendors and suppliers through the second quarter of and then implement appropriate contingency plans 
in addition  in order to protect against the acquisition of additional non compliant products  the company now requires suppliers to warrant that products sold or licensed to the company are yk compliant 
in the event that any of the company s significant suppliers do not successfully achieve yk compliance in a timely manner  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted on a timely basis and would not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company has not yet fully developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if the company is unable to achieve yk readiness of its critical operations 
development of contingency plans are in progress and will be completed by the end of first quarter of there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop a contingency plan that will adequately address issues that may arise in the year the failure of the company to develop and implement  if necessary  an appropriate contingency plan could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
finally  the company is also vulnerable to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility and transportation company yk compliance failures and related service interruptions 
the company anticipates completing the mission critical  high impact yk issues by the first half of  which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems and expects the yk project to continue beyond the year with respect to the upgrading  replacement and testing of non critical systems 
these dates are contingent upon the timeliness and accuracy of software and hardware upgrades from vendors  adequacy and quality of resources available to work on completion of the project and any other unforeseen factors 
the total expense of the yk project is currently estimated at approximately  of which approximately  has been spent through december   which is not material to the company s business operations or financial condition 
the expenses of the yk project are being funded through operating cash flows 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company invests in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
the company s investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the interest rates the company invests in short term securities and maintains an average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease less than in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities 
the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial positions at december  actual results may differ materially
