item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled distribution  information systems  competition  and business risks included in this form k for the year ended january  overview petsmart is the largest operator of superstores specializing in pet food  supplies and services in north america and the united kingdom 
at january   the company operated superstores  consisting of superstores in the united states  superstores in the united kingdom  and superstores in canada 
petsmart s store base has grown rapidly since the company s inception in through the opening of new stores and through the acquisitions of petzazz in march  petstuff in june  pet food giant in september  and pet city in december the company also acquired two leading catalog retailers  sporting dog in may and state line tack in january all of these transactions were accounted for as poolings of interest 
the company expects that future increases in net sales and net income  if any  will be dependent on the opening of additional superstores and the improved performance of existing superstores 
in view of the increasing maturity of its superstore base  as well as the planned opening of additional superstores in existing markets and single store markets  the company anticipates that its comparable store sales increases may be lower in future periods 
as a result of its expansion plans  the company anticipates the timing of new superstore openings  and related preopening expenses  and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing superstores may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
the company has achieved less favorable operating results in certain north american geographic regions it recently entered than it has achieved historically in other regions 
in addition  because new superstores have higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature superstores  the impact of new superstore openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until they become established 
the company currently charges preopening costs associated with each new superstore to earnings when the superstore is opened 
beginning in fiscal  preopening costs will be expensed as incurred  in accordance with a recent aicpa statement of position see recent accounting pronouncements section below 
therefore  the company expects that the opening of large numbers of new superstores in a given quarter will adversely impact its quarterly results of operations for that period 
business combinations and restructuring charges during fiscal  the company acquired  in two separate transactions  all of the outstanding equity interests of state line tack in exchange for  shares of petsmart common stock  including approximately  shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of state line tack stock options assumed in the merger  and of pet city holdings plc in exchange for approximately  shares of petsmart common stock  plus approximately  shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of pet city stock options assumed in the merger 
in connection with the above transactions  the company recorded merger and integration charges of million 
these charges included investment banking  legal and accounting fees  and miscellaneous transaction costs million  provision for the closure of redundant or inadequate facilities million  costs associated with reformatting  refixturing  and remerchandising the acquired superstores to the format consistent with that of a petsmart superstore million  and other costs of integration million 
in addition  the company recorded million of similar business integration costs  primarily store conversion costs  associated with the pet city merger as nonrecurring charges during fiscal also during fiscal  the company recorded merger and integration charges of million  principally as a result of a change in its accounting estimate of the lease termination costs anticipated to be incurred in connection with the settlement of lease obligations for the former petstuff stores closed by the company immediately following the merger with petstuff  along with seven lease commitments for future petstuff locations that were either duplicate or inadequate facilities and  therefore  never opened 
the company estimated lease settlement costs associated with the closed stores  and the leases related to the unopened locations  would require million of such additional expenditures 
the remaining million of the additional charge was primarily related to petstuff store conversion costs 
in connection with its initiatives to refocus its operations  the company in the second quarter of fiscal recorded charges of million  of which approximately million was recorded as a separate restructuring charge during the quarter 
approximately million was related to the costs of closing or relocating stores  of which were former acquired stores  approximately million was related to the costs of discontinuing the discovery center department in all superstores and the write down or write off of related fixtures  and approximately million was related to the company s previous acquisitions 
the remaining charges of million included approximately million of anticipated costs associated with the company s decision to complete the consolidation of distribution facilities and approximately million representing the write off of the company s investment in certain entities accounted for under the cost method which were impaired as a result of the company s decision to exit certain departments within the petsmart superstores 
of the remaining million of one time charges  approximately million of related charges were recorded as cost of goods sold  million were recorded as store operating expenses  and million were included in general and administrative expenses 
the million of other one time expenses were comprised of the write down or write off of certain impaired assets  including discontinued discovery center merchandise  from cost to net realizable value  reserves for litigation and other matters 
the million of other expenses reflected as a component of store operating expenses and the million of one time expenses reflected as general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a change in estimated self insurance costs due to adverse loss developments in the company s worker s compensation experience  expenses related to the preliminary stages of a consulting project for the new management information system  certain costs of several litigation matters  as well as expenses related to other miscellaneous matters 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million benefit was recognized as a change in estimate as a result of favorable settlements of real estate leases on stores identified for closure in conjunction with the fiscal restructuring charge

the company has also used cash to purchase superstores for sale and leaseback 
net cash used in investing activities was million for net cash flow from financing activities  primarily the change in the company s bank overdraft  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  and principal payments on capital leases  was million for fiscal the company s primary long term capital requirements are for opening new superstores  the costs of closing redundant or inadequate superstores identified in second quarter  merger and business integration costs and corporate investment  including costs associated with the development and implementation of the company s new information system  and for working capital 
all of the company s superstores are leased facilities 
the company estimates that the cash requirements after lease financing to open each new us prototype superstore  including store fixtures and equipment  leasehold improvements  preopening costs and inventory is approximately  for the company s  square foot prototype store  this amount will typically include an average of approximately  for leasehold improvements an average of approximately  if the superstore site is a rehabilitated unit  approximately  for preopening costs  and approximately  for inventory  net of accounts payable 
approximately  is required for store fixtures and equipment  which is typically fully funded through lease financing 
the company has begun to open  square foot superstore locations  primarily in single store markets and as fill in locations in existing markets 
the company expects that these smaller stores will comprise a growing percentage of its new store locations in future years as the company s real estate strategy matures 
these locations are generally leased facilities and capital expenditures for these locations will typically include approximately  for inventory  net of accounts payable  approximately  for preopening costs  and an average of approximately  for leasehold improvements 
approximately  is required for store fixtures and equipment  which is also typically fully funded through lease financing 
based upon the company s current plan to open approximately new north american stores during fiscal  approximately million will be needed to finance these openings 
the company may also expend additional funds to take advantage of opportunities that arise from time to time for the acquisition of businesses or lease rights from tenants occupying retail space that is suitable for a petsmart superstore 
petsmart is in the implementation stage of developing and implementing an integrated north america information system which will feature a common set of applications 
the company estimates that its costs in connection with the development and implementation of the new system  before giving consideration to any lease financing that may be available  will be up to million annually through fiscal the company believes that certain hardware and software components of the new system will be financed through lease transactions  some of which have been completed 
there can be no assurance that the actual costs for the new system will not exceed current estimates  or that the new system can be developed  tested and implemented on a timely basis  or at all  or that it will deliver the anticipated operational benefits in a reliable manner 
failure to complete the new system on a timely basis could materially adversely affect the company s future operating results or its ability to expand 
in particular  should the new system not be operational  or should an alternate solution not be implemented by january   the company may experience software difficulties as a result of the so called year problem see year readiness 
in the event that additional financing is required to complete the company s new information system  there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms 
capital expenditures  net of construction allowances  were approximately million during fiscal such expenditures were used primarily for the opening of new superstores in north america and the united kingdom  the development and implementation of the company s new information system and the remodel and maintenance of the company s existing superstores 
management believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under its bank credit facility and available lease financing will provide adequate funds for the company s foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
the company s ability to fund its operations and to make planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  to refinance indebtedness and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
seasonality and inflation the company s business is subject to some seasonal fluctuation and it typically realizes a substantial portion of its net sales and operating profits during the fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s products and services designed to address pet health needs  such as flea and tick problems  have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the introduction of alternative treatments  as well as by variations in weather conditions 
in addition  because petsmart s superstores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions 
the company s results of operations and financial position are presented based upon historical cost 
although the company cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe inflation is likely to have a material adverse effect on its net sales or results of operations

the company will adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal and does not expect a material effect on its financial statements as a result of adoption 
year readiness the year systems processing problem  as it is commonly known  is caused by currently utilized computer systems  including several used by the company  being coded to only accept two digit codes for the year field in a date set of data 
beginning in the year  these date fields must be able to accept four digit entries to distinguish base year dates with base year dates 
the company is and has been addressing the year systems issue through various initiatives  all of which are in progress 
a new integrated north america information system  which is year compliant  is currently in the implementation stage 
the system is scheduled to be operational for the north american retail operations during the first half of fiscal other initiatives in place include issue awareness programs  inventory and identification of all year sensitive components including hardware  software  and telecommunications  requesting of compliance status statements from company business partners  suppliers  and vendors  and testing of all new and existing systems

similar year readiness programs are in place in the company s united kingdom and catalog operational segments  with costs to address those segment s year issues not expected to be material 
there can be no assurance  however  that the new north america information system can be developed  tested  and implemented on a timely basis or that it will deliver the desired operational benefits 
nor can there be assurance that the initiatives put in place to address the year issues will identify and remove all potential operational impacts 
while significant economic detriment from year issues is not expected  there can be no assurance that there will not be operational difficulties in the company s stores  warehouses  or corporate offices  the financial magnitude of which is not currently estimable 
the year initiatives being conducted by the company are expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem  including the year compliance and readiness of external partners 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new north america business systems and the completion of its year initiatives as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced 
although the company believes contingency plans will not need to be utilized based on progress to date  contingency plans have been developed for each critical system 
the specifics of the contingency plans vary depending on the system and assessed risk of non compliance and such plans are modified periodically based on review and testing 
the plans are comprised of activities such as upgrading existing systems  reallocating internal resources  obtaining additional external resources  and implementing temporary manual processes

the company has entered into interest rate swaps to lower its funding costs and reduce its exposure to changes in short term interest rates 
under these arrangements  the company may convert variable rate lease payments and borrowings into borrowings at a fixed rate of approximately 
the company does not expect changes in fair value of the arrangements to have a significant effect on the company s operations  cash flow or financial position
