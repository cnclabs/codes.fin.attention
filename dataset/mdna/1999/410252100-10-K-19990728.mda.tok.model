nce sales to other divisions within the company were million in fiscal and million for fiscal international had net sales of million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of

repositioning and related charges were million in fiscal  and million in fiscal further discussion follows regarding the company s strategic repositioning program 
net interest expense for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal this decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower borrowing levels 
minority interest recognized in the statement of operations represents the minority shareholders portion of the income loss for less than wholly owned subsidiaries 
the mexican unit s losses during fiscal were mitigated to some extent by the sharing of the losses with the company s joint venture partner 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the interest of its partner in mexico 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold a interest in its mexican operations to a new joint venture partner 
minority interest was expense of million in fiscal and income of million in fiscal accounts receivable were million at may   compared to million at may  this decrease was primarily attributable to the lower level of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal merchandise inventories were million at may   compared to million at may  the decrease in merchandise inventories was primarily attributable to the her and international video  book and software inventories  which were reduced in connection with exiting these product lines 
the increase in other current assets to million at may  from million at may  was attributable to an increase in income tax receivable related to a net operating loss carryback arising from the repositioning charges in fiscal the decrease in property and equipment  net to million at may  from million at may  was caused by the write off of certain fixed assets in connection with the company s repositioning program  principally video  book and software display fixtures  as well as the sale of certain company owned facilities 
the decrease in accounts payable to million at may  from million at may  was directly related to the decrease in merchandise inventories during the comparable time period 
the increase in other current liabilities to million at may  from million at may  was chiefly due to an million increase in accrued royalties within nce and an increase of million in accrued employee compensation 
the decrease in debt  non current to million at may  from million at may  was substantially attributable to cash generated in connection with the company s repositioning program including million from the sale of stock received in connection with the sale of the sofsource subsidiary  reclassification of million of senior notes to debt  current portion and reduced working capital requirements attributable to the repositioning program 
this decrease in debt was achieved even though the company spent approximately million in connection with its share repurchase program 
during the first quarter of fiscal  nce purchased additional shares of the itsy bitsy entertainment company  inc itsy bitsy 
as a result  nce owns a share in itsy bitsy  a firm dedicated to licensing and marketing entertainment properties for children and their caregivers 
itsy bitsy has the exclusive right to license a number of childrens properties including ragdoll productions  teletubbies and tots tv  and enid blyton s noddy 
the inclusion of itsy bitsy s results of operations in fiscal did not have a material effect on reported consolidated revenues or consolidated results of operations 
the following comments relate to the company s strategic repositioning program 
on june   the company s board of directors approved a comprehensive strategic repositioning program designed to focus the company on its core music distribution business 
the program had four major components 
exit the her and international video  book and software distribution and service operations  
reduce the number of customers serviced in the music distribution business within her and international to a select group of strategic partners who could best benefit from handleman s category management and systems investments  
sell sofsource  the company s software publishing subsidiary  and 
implement a new common stock repurchase program 
the operational repositioning activities  including employee severance programs  were all completed during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company sold its book distribution business to levy home entertainment at a pre tax loss of approximately million  and its sofsource subsidiary to the learning company at a pre tax gain of million 
her and international have exited the video and software distribution business activities  as well as ceased providing services to a number of music customers 
the decision was made to exit these activities  as well as to reduce the number of customers serviced in the music distribution business  because these businesses or customers either did not provide an appropriate and consistent rate of return or did not have the potential for sustainable growth and profitability 
the repositioning program resulted in a million charge to earnings in the first quarter of fiscal  representing asset adjustments and cost accruals directly related to the repositioning program  other than those costs actually incurred and charged to earnings in fiscal and certain costs that were incurred in the last three quarters of fiscal that were required to be expensed as incurred 
a summary of the components of the million pre tax repositioning and related charge recognized in fiscal is as follows in millions first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter fiscal adjustments of assets to net realizable value intangibles write off other repositioning related costs total adjustments of assets to net realizable value included adjustments to reflect the estimated recovery amount of assets disposed of during fiscal that were directly related to exited businesses or customers no longer serviced 
the components of the provision were  principally  inventory of million and property and equipment of million  as well as certain adjustments to the carrying value of receivables of million  payables of million and investments  including international investments of million 
intangibles related to either businesses exited  or customers no longer serviced  are included in the intangibles write off 
other repositioning related costs recorded in the first quarter of fiscal were principally employee severance costs of million  advisory fees of million  debt restructuring costs of million and inventory handling costs of million 
other repositioning related costs recognized in subsequent quarters were primarily employee stay bonus costs and advisory fees  which were not accruable as part of the initial repositioning charge  and therefore  were expensed as incurred 
the amount of each element of the overall repositioning charge was determined based upon the actual cost of the asset and management estimates of recoverability 
in the case of receivables  the fact that certain accounts would be settled with customer product returns rather than cash  which resulted in a reversal of gross margin  was taken into consideration  as well as liquidation value of the inventory returned since ongoing relationships with certain vendors no longer existed and  therefore  return authorizations would be difficult to obtain 
in the case of property and equipment  which was principally display fixtures in customer stores  the charge represented the net book value of such abandoned display fixtures 
there were no adjustments necessary to the original estimated repositioning provision of million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal the repositioning program resulted in a reduction of approximately  positions approximately of the company s total workforce 
this reduction occurred predominantly in the her division 
for the most part the reductions were in the following areas field sales representatives  distribution facility employees  and the corporate headquarters 
employee severance amounts were determined based upon an employee s length of service  salary grade level and compensation 
total employee severance paid in fiscal in connection with the repositioning program was approximately million 
as a result of the repositioning actions  the company expected to realize an improvement in operating income in excess of million pre tax 
the savings were to result from a reduction in operating costs at a rate greater than the projected decrease in revenues  because both average customer size and average sales volume of departments serviced increased significantly 
benefits of the repositioning program began to occur in the second quarter of fiscal as the program was implemented 
also on june   the board of directors approved an month common stock repurchase program  subject to the generation of cash from the sale of assets and reduced working capital needs  as well as the requirements of the company s credit agreements 
during fiscal  the company purchased  shares at a cost of approximately million under the repurchase program 
the company now expects that an additional million to million will be spent under the repurchase program through the expiration of the board approved authorization in december these repurchases are in addition to the  shares repurchased in fiscal under a repurchase program which was replaced by this new authorization 
comparison of fiscal with fiscal for fiscal  revenues decreased to billion from billion for the fiscal year ended may  fiscal  primarily as a result of lower sales in the video distribution business 
net income for fiscal was 
million or 
per share  compared to million or 
per share for fiscal net earnings for fiscal included pre tax repositioning and related charges of million  representing costs incurred in fiscal to facilitate the repositioning  as well as costs associated with closing the albany and atlanta warehouses and the abandonment of certain investments 
her had net sales of million for fiscal  compared to  million for fiscal  a decrease of 
her fiscal music sales grew to million from million for fiscal  due to increased sales of compact discs  increased market share with mass merchants and more hit albums in fiscal video sales declined to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  substantially attributable to customers buying direct from the major video studios 
book sales decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  principally resulting from fewer hit titles 
personal computer software sales decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily the result of two major customers exiting the product line 
nce had net sales of million for fiscal  compared to for fiscal  a decrease of less than 
nce sales to other divisions within the company were million for fiscal and million for fiscal international had net sales of million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in international sales was principally from operations in brazil and argentina  where year over year net sales increased by million and million  respectively 
sales in international  however  were somewhat impacted by pressure from mexican retailers to reduce store inventories which limited shipments and increased returns 
direct product costs as a percentage of revenues declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement in direct product costs as a percentage of revenues was substantially attributable to her  which experienced a reduction in low margin  mega hit video sales and an increase in music sales 
music products have a cost to revenue relationship lower than her s overall relationship of direct product costs to revenues 
sg a expenses were million of revenues for fiscal  compared to million of revenues for fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses was attributable to improvements in the her operating unit 
the decrease in her sg a expenses was somewhat offset by increased sg a expenses within the nce and international operating units 
nce fiscal sg a expenses increased by million over the fiscal sg a expense level  primarily related to new product introductions 
sg a expenses in international increased by million over the fiscal expense level as a result of the increased product returns in mexico and the growth of the brazilian and argentine operations 
despite the increases in international and nce  consolidated sg a expenses declined million for fiscal as a result of continued cost reductions in her  as discussed above 
operating income for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal her s operating income was million in fiscal  versus million in fiscal nce s operating income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal international s operating loss was million in fiscal  versus operating income of million in fiscal improvement in operating income within her was offset by deterioration in operating income within international 
the improvement in her was driven by the aforementioned reductions in both direct product costs as a percentage of revenues and sg a expenses 
the deterioration within international was primarily attributable to mexico  which experienced a million year over year decrease in operating income 
the resultant loss in mexico was caused by the combination of lower customer shipments  increased product returns and higher sg a expenses  as discussed above 
decreases in operating income in brazil and argentina of million and million  respectively  and an increase in corporate costs to support international activities  also contributed to the overall operating loss in international 
net interest expense for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates 
income before income taxes and minority interest in fiscal was  compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the million provision for repositioning and related charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal mexican losses during the first three quarters of fiscal were mitigated to some extent by a sharing of the losses with the company s joint venture partner 
the minority interest was income of million for fiscal and expense of million for fiscal accounts receivable were million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal  a decrease of 
the lower receivable balance was attributable to the lower level of sales during the fourth quarter this year compared to the fourth quarter last year  as well as a concerted collection effort which reduced days sales outstanding in accounts receivable by seven days 
merchandise inventories were million as of may   compared to million as of may   a decrease of million 
a substantial decrease in her inventory levels  resulting from the company s inventory reduction program  was mostly offset by increases in nce and international inventory levels 
the decrease in net property and equipment for fiscal from fiscal was due to the disposal of video display fixtures  related to customers buying direct from the major studios  as well as the sale of certain company owned facilities resulting from the transition to the automated distribution center system 
debt  non current was reduced by million from million as of may  to million as of may  this decrease was achieved despite spending approximately million in connection with the company s share repurchase program 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at may  was million  compared to million at may   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in working capital primarily resulted from a reduction in merchandise inventories without a comparable reduction in accounts payable 
the working capital ratio was to at may   compared to to at may  for fiscal  net cash provided from operating activities primarily resulted from her and nce operating income  as well as non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and recoupment of license advances 
capital assets consist primarily of display fixtures  warehouse equipment and facilities 
the company also acquires or licenses video and music products which it markets 
purchases of these assets are expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations 
the company has an unsecured  five year   credit agreement with a consortium of banks  that expires in september no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of may  the company also has  outstanding as of may  under a senior note agreement with a group of insurance companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for scheduled maturities of the senior notes 
in connection with the repositioning program discussed previously  the company amended its bank credit agreement and senior note agreement to effect compliance with existing restrictions and covenants of the agreements 
management believes that the amended credit agreement  and the amended senior note agreement  will provide sufficient amounts to fund day to day operations and higher peak seasonal demands 
for further information  reference should be made to notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other information the company s financial statements have reported amounts based on historical costs which represent dollars of varying purchasing power and do not measure the effects of inflation 
if the financial statements had been restated for inflation  net income would have been lower because depreciation expense would have to be increased to reflect the most current costs 
inflation within the economies in which the company does business has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations 
year project in may  the company formed an internal team to study the information system s issue commonly referred to as year as a result  a project plan was developed to address the year issue 
the company s year plan covers the enterprise wide information technology systems 
the company s information technology systems are comprised of mainframe applications  as systems  pc client server applications  pc desktop lan infrastructure  telecomm voice infrastructure  embedded systems  sales force automation and stirling douglas merchandising and replenishment application 
the company s information technology systems play a vital role to support its business operations 
in december  the company s chief executive officer issued the company s year policy 
the company s chief information officer cio is the year project sponsor 
the year project management team meets with the cio on a weekly basis to report on project progress and discuss issues 
all year projects are in the final testing phase or have been completed 
the company completed the remediation and testing of of its mission critical enterprise applications by may  the company anticipates the completion of its enterprise year project by august  the company s mainframe applications are a major part of its information technology systems inventory 
the year project incorporated the remediation and testing of the company s million lines of code for mainframe applications 
the company used the services of third party consulting firms  in conjunction with its own information technology staff  for the mainframe applications year project 
the company completed the remediation and testing of its entire mainframe application inventory by may  the company s mainframe data center is an outsourced operation 
the company worked closely with its data center service provider to address the system related year issues 
system level year readiness status was achieved by may  the company prepared the year remediation  upgrade and test plans to address its as systems  pc client server applications  pc desktop lan server infrastructure  telecomm voice infrastructure  embedded systems  sales force automation and stirling douglas applications 
the vast majority of these projects are completed and in production 
the few remaining are in the final testing phase 
as a part of the year project  the company trained its information technology staff on the year awareness and year remediation and testing technologies  on an as needed basis 
the year issue can arise at any point in the company s supply  processing  distribution and financial chains 
the company surveyed its merchandise trading partners to assess their general it and edi year readiness status 
the company prepared plans for the year capability of its edi systems 
the company successfully completed the national retail federation s edi test to handle two position year dates 
the company tested year compliant edi transactions with certain of its merchandise trading partners 
the company continues to refine its contingency plans intended to mitigate possible disruptions in business operations that may result from the year issue 
the contingency plans may include increasing inventory levels  stockpiling packaging materials  securing alternative sources of supply  adjusting facility schedules  manual workarounds  additional staffing and other appropriate measures 
these plans will continue to be evaluated and modified throughout the year transition period as additional information becomes available 
the company is currently working on its year readiness plan for its non it systems 
non it systems include security card systems  building access systems  elevators  fax machines  copiers  security alarm systems  auxiliary power generator systems  etc 
the company is surveying its non merchandising trading partners for both it and non it systems data center service provider  application support service providers  critical material suppliers  banks  electricity and telecommunications service providers  etc 
for their year readiness status 
because of the vast number of business systems used by the company and the significant number of key business partners  the company could experience some disruption in its business due to the year issue 
more specifically  because of the interdependent nature of the business systems  the company could be adversely affected if utilities  private businesses and governmental entities with which it does business or that provide essential services are not year ready 
although it is not currently possible to quantify the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  the possible consequences of the company or key business partners not being fully year ready in a timely manner include  among other things  delays in the delivery of products  delays in the receipt of supplies  invoice and collection errors  and inventory and supply obsolescence 
consequently  the business and results of operations of the company could be adversely affected by a temporary inability of the company to conduct its business in the ordinary course for periods of time 
however  the company believes that its year readiness program  including the contingency planning  should significantly reduce the adverse effect  if any  of such disruptions 
the total estimated cost for the year project is million 
these costs are being expensed as incurred  and are being financed through operating cash flow 
approximately million of the total project costs have been incurred as of may  the company has also accelerated the replacement of certain non ready systems to meet year requirements 
in july  the company launched an oracle financials implementation project to replace its existing general ledger  fixed assets and accounts receivables systems 
the company is using third party consulting firms  in conjunction with its own information technology staff  to implement the oracle financials system 
the company anticipates completing the oracle financials implementation project by august costs associated with new computer systems are being capitalized  as appropriate  under current accounting standards 
other non year information system projects either have not been materially delayed or impacted by the company s year initiatives  or if delayed  such delay does not have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position 
management recognizes that not becoming year capable in a timely manner could result in material financial risk 
while management expects all remaining planned work to be completed timely  there can be no assurance that all systems will be capable by the year  that the systems of other companies and government agencies on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner  or that contingency planning will be able to fully address all potential interruptions 
therefore  date related issues could cause delays in the company s ability to ship its products  process transactions  or otherwise conduct business in any of its markets
