for  the increase in software product revenues is attributable to growth of the company s newer product offerings 
the company s newer products primarily focus on system verification and design re use subsets of the eda industry  which have experienced above industry average growth rates over the last year 
in addition  improved demand for several of the company s older product offerings is primarily attributable to recent product upgrades such as year compliance and ports to the windows nt platform 
accelerated verification revenue also improved in as next generation systems began shipping in the first half of the year 
the company s simexpress accelerated verification product is not available in us markets due to a court ruling 
see part i item legal proceedings for further discussion 
these increases occurred despite the weakening of the japanese yen versus the us dollar which negatively impacted revenues 
see geographic revenues information for further discussion 
for compared to  the decrease in system and software revenue was attributable to a decline in software product sales partially offset by increased sales of accelerated verification systems 
software product revenues declined in due in part to an accelerated decline of the company s older integrated circuit ic and also certain printed circuit board products 
gross margins were significantly higher for compared to due to lower costs for direct materials and overhead  lower third party product sales for which royalties were paid  lower purchased technology and capitalized software development costs amortization  and a write down of certain previously capitalized software development costs in for compared to  the decline in system and software gross margins as a percent of revenues was due to higher royalty costs  one time inventory and capitalized software development cost adjustments and higher purchased technology amortization 
increased royalty costs in were primarily attributable to a write off of costs associated with a non refundable royalty contract where the committed costs were not recovered 
in addition  the company incurred an inventory write down of all us simexpress systems inventory in as a result of the court ruling 
see part i item legal proceedings for further discussion 
amortization of previously capitalized software development costs to system and software cost of revenues was zero in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
in addition  the company recognized impairment in value of certain previously capitalized software development costs in primarily as a result of the accelerated decline in sales of older software product offerings 
these costs  which totaled  were determined to be unrecoverable and were charged to system and software cost of revenues in the first quarter of amortization of purchased technology costs to system and software cost of revenues was   and  for  and  respectively 
the decline in amortization in is attributable to a significant decline in business acquisitions in and and accelerated amortization of technologies in where assets were impaired or disposed of 
purchased technology costs are amortized over a three year period to system and software cost of revenues 
service and support service and support revenues consist of revenues from annual software support contracts and professional services  which includes consulting services  training services  custom design services and other services 
the decrease in service and support revenues in is due primarily to an approximate decrease in professional service revenues offset by a slight increase in support revenues 
the increase in service and support revenues in was due primarily to an approximate increase in professional service revenues as well as a slight increase in software support revenues 
for  growth levels for software support revenues compared to software product revenues were lower due in part to the carryover effect of the prior year decline in software product revenues 
for  growth in software support revenues occurred despite a decline in software product revenues as the installed base of customers on support contracts increased during the year 
since growth in software support is dependent on continued success of the software product offerings  increases in the company s installed customer base  and the impact of acquisitions  future software support revenue levels are difficult to predict 
professional service revenues totaled approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in is due to a more narrowly focused effort toward engagements that enable customers to better utilize the company s products and away from out source custom design service engagements 
consulting engagements with printed circuit board design customers also declined in due in part to lower printed circuit board software product sales in the increase in professional services in was attributable to consulting services and custom design services as demand for these services grew 
service and support gross margins increased in as a result of higher software support revenues and approximately flat software support cost of revenues 
professional service gross margins were negative in as several prior period contracts continued to require resources 
in  professional service gross margins were negative due to unprofitable contracts  most of which were entered into in  where costs of completion exceeded the revenues 
the company has refined its contract approval practices to reduce the likelihood of entering into unprofitable custom design contracts 
geographic revenues information americas revenues including service and support revenues  increased by from to and by from to revenues outside of the americas represented of total revenues in  and european revenues increased by approximately from to and from to increased european revenues are attributable to improved economic conditions primarily in the telecommunications industry and increased demand for newer product offerings in the effects of exchange rate differences from european currencies to the us dollar for and were not significant 
japanese revenues decreased by approximately from to and from to the effects of exchange rate differences from the japanese yen to the us dollar negatively impacted revenues by approximately and in and  respectively 
exclusive of currency effects  lower revenue levels in japan are the result of continued economic difficulties in since the company generates approximately half of its revenues outside of the us and expects this to continue in the future  revenue results should continue to be impacted by the effects of future foreign currency fluctuations

the increase in r d spending in was also attributable to investment in core strategy areas and merger and acquisition activity 
r d costs increased in by approximately  as a result of prior year business purchases 
these purchases during resulted in added expenses only from the date of acquisition and not for all prior periods presented as is the case for pooling of interest transactions 
in addition  other business combinations accounted for as pooling of interests experienced higher r d investment in during and  the company capitalized software development costs of  compared to  for this decrease in capitalization is due to timing and content of product development activities which resulted in a lower level of costs eligible for capitalization 
based on these lower eligible costs  product development activities have been expensed on a current basis 
the company does not expect significant capitalization in marketing and selling in the increase in marketing and selling costs was principally attributable to increased product sales through the company s direct sales force and third party distributors offset in part by savings resulting from subsidiary divestitures totaling approximately  in  the increase in marketing and selling costs was principally attributable to prior year business purchases and increased sales through third party distributors 
the year to year impact of acquisitions on marketing and selling costs in was approximately  in addition  selling costs increased approximately  in as a result of increased third party sales channel revenue 
a stronger us dollar during and reduced expenses by approximately and in japan  respectively 
general and administration for compared to general and administrative g a costs decreased as a percent of sales due to subsidiary divestitures and higher sales volume 
for  the absolute dollar increase in g a is attributable to increased headcount to maintain and support business systems and support higher sales volume

see part i item legal proceedings for further discussion 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
interest expense was  and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income and interest expense in and versus is primarily attributable to lower average cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and borrowings outstanding during and due to pay down of short term lines of credit and the long term revolving credit facility 
for  exclusive of any changes in cash balances or interest rates  the increase in interest bearing term receivables should favorably affect interest income 
in  the company sold common stock of two independent public companies for  that had carrying costs of  resulting in a gain of  provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes was   and  in  and  respectively 
the tax provision benefit in all periods is the result of the mix of profits earned by the company and its subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates 
because the company s income tax position for each year combines the effects of available tax benefits in certain countries where the company does business  benefits from available net operating loss carryforwards and tax expense for subsidiaries with pre tax income  the company s income tax position and resultant effective tax rate is uncertain for and beyond 
effects of foreign currency fluctuations approximately half of the company s revenues are generated outside of the united states 
for  and  approximately half of european and all of japanese revenues were subject to exchange rate fluctuations as they were booked in local currencies 
the effects of these fluctuations were substantially offset by local currency cost of revenues and operating expenses  which resulted in an immaterial net effect on the company s results of operations 
the accumulated other comprehensive income foreign currency translation adjustment  as reported in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets  increased to  at december   from  at the end of this reflects the increase in the value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies since year end as a result of a stronger us dollar at the close of versus new accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no

in  cash used by financing activities was negatively impacted by the pay down of short term lines of credit and the long term revolving credit facility totaling  offset by the release of  in cash held as collateral previously classified as long term on the consolidated balance sheets 
cash and short term investments were positively impacted by the proceeds from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases in the amount of  and  in and  respectively 
in  this increase was offset by repurchases of common stock of  compared to zero in trade accounts receivable the trade accounts receivable balance increased  from december  compared to december  average days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased slightly from days at the end of to days at the end of prepaid expenses and other prepaid expenses and other increased  from december  to december  this increase is primarily due to capitalized acquisition costs related to the unsolicited tender offer for quickturn of  which will be expensed in due to the company s withdrawal of the offer 
in addition  the accelerated verification systems inventory balance increased by  term receivables  long term term receivables  long term increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in demand for multi year  multi element term license and perpetual license installment sales term agreements from the company s top rated credit customers 
balances under term agreements that are due within one year are included in trade accounts receivable and balances that are due in more than one year are included in term receivables  long term 
the company uses term agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
capital resources expenditures for property and equipment decreased to  for compared to  for the decrease in capital expenditures is a result of fewer individually significant projects in as compared to in  the company completed three business acquisitions and purchased quickturn stock  which resulted in cash payments of  the company anticipates that current cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operating activities  and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  and words of similar import  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
moreover  from time to time the company may issue other forward looking statements 
the following discussion highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
the company competes in the highly competitive and dynamic eda industry 
the company s success is dependent upon its ability to develop and market products that are innovative  cost competitive and meet customer expectations 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can create adverse effects including  but not limited to  price reductions  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
the company s business is largely dependent upon the success and growth of the electronics industry 
the outlook for the electronics industry for is uncertain due in part to adverse economic conditions in asia and to potential slowing of growth in other regions 
as a result  many companies in the electronics industry have announced employee layoffs and will likely curtail the number of electronic design projects and the level of demand for design automation capital which could result in decreased spending for the company s products and services 
in addition  there have been a number of mergers in the electronics industry  which could result in decreased or delayed capital spending patterns 
the above business challenges for the electronics and related industries may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a material amount of the company s software product revenue is usually the result of current quarter order performance of which the majority is usually booked in the last month of each quarter 
in addition  the company s revenue often includes multi million dollar contracts 
the timing of the completion of these contracts and the terms of delivery of software  hardware and other services can have a material impact on revenue recognition for a given quarter 
the combination of these factors impairs and delays the company s ability to identify shortfalls or overages from quarterly revenue targets 
the company uses term or installment sales agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
these multi year  multi element term license and perpetual license term agreements are from the company s top rated credit customers and average between one and three years in length 
these agreements may increase the element of risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product satisfaction or disagreements and disputes 
if collectibility for any of these multi million dollar agreements becomes a problem the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company generally realizes approximately half of its revenues outside the us and expects this to continue in the future 
as such  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations can impact the company s business and operating results 
to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts 
however  significant changes in exchange rates may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
international operations subject the company to other risks including  but not limited to  changes in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions  government trade restrictions  limitations on repatriation of earnings  licensing and intellectual property rights protection 
a significant percent of the company s sales to european customers is us dollar based 
however  the company is affected by the emergence of the new european monetary unit and is currently implementing and testing system changes to support transactions in this currency 
provided the company s european monetary unit project is completed on a timely basis  the expense of the project  and its related effect on the company s earnings  is not expected to be material 
the company is currently re aligning its professional services business in an attempt to improve profitability by moving toward engagements that enable customers to better utilize the company s products and away from out source custom design service engagements 
business reorganizations can increase personnel management complexities including retention and hiring of key technical and management personnel 
while the company will attempt to improve the execution and pricing of its services  there can be no assurance that the challenges will be effectively met 
the company s operating expenses are generally committed in advance of revenue and are based to a large degree on future revenue expectations 
operating expenses are incurred in order to generate and sustain higher future revenue levels 
if the revenue does not materialize as expected  the company s results of operations can be adversely impacted 
acquisitions of complementary businesses are a part of the company s overall business strategy 
there are several risks associated with this strategy including integration of sales channels  training and education of the sales force for new product offerings  integration of product development efforts  retention of key employees  integration of systems of internal controls  and integration of information systems 
all of these factors can impair the company s ability to forecast  to meet quarterly revenue and earnings targets  to meet various debt obligations used to finance acquisitions and to effectively manage the business for long term growth 
there can be no assurance that these challenges will be effectively met 
as a result of the acquisition of meta systems and its accelerated verification products  the company has entered the hardware development and assembly business 
some risk factors include procuring hardware components on a timely basis  assembling and shipping systems on a timely basis with appropriate quality control  developing new distribution and shipment processes  managing inventory  developing new processes to deliver customer support of the hardware and placing new demands on the sales force 
in addition  the company is engaged in litigation with quickturn in which quickturn has asserted that the company and meta are infringing quickturn s patents 
a trial is scheduled in june and no assurance can be given as to the outcome of such trial 
this litigation may negatively affect demand for accelerated verification products for all vendors worldwide until the outcome is determined 
this could result in lower sales of the company s accelerated verification products and increase its risk of inventory obsolescence and could have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has been able to recruit and retain necessary personnel to research and develop  market  sell and service products that satisfy customers needs 
there can be no assurance that the company can continue to recruit and retain such personnel 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company is involved in various administrative matters and litigation 
there can be no assurance that various litigation and administrative matters will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see part i item legal proceedings for further discussion 
due to the factors above  as well as other market factors outside the company s control  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indication of future performance 
the investment community should use caution in using historical trends to estimate future results or trends 
in addition  if future results vary significantly from expectations of analysts  the company s stock price could be adversely impacted 
year the company is aware of the potential inability of computer programs to adequately process date information after december  year 
the company has conducted a review of its products  information technology and facilities computer systems to identify all software that could be affected by the year issue and has developed or is developing implementation plans to address this issue 
the company has announced that its current release of software products is year compliant 
the effect of the year issue with regard to the company s product offerings is not expected to have any material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operations of the company s office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switched security systems  elevators and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect of  and costs of remediating the year problem on this equipment 
the company estimates that its total cost of completing any required modifications  upgrades or replacements of these internal systems should total approximately  in identifiable expenditures through have totaled approximately  in addition  the company has developed and is implementing a program to review the year compliance status of computer software programs licensed from third parties and used in its internal business processes to obtain appropriate assurances of year compliance from manufacturers of these products 
the company believes that it will be able to complete its year compliance review and make any necessary modifications prior to the end of provided the company s year projects are completed on a timely basis  the expense of these projects  and its related effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  is not expected to be material 
however  the compliance of systems acquired from third parties is dependent on factors outside the company s control 
if key systems  or a significant number of systems fail as a result of year problems  the company could incur substantial expense and experience a disruption of business operations  which would potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the company is making an assessment as to whether any of its customers  suppliers or service providers will be affected by the year issue 
failure of the company s customers  suppliers or service providers to comply with year could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies may be required to devote significant resources to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase the company s software products that could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that year related operating problems or material expenses will not occur with the company s computer systems or in connection with the interface to the company s major vendors or suppliers 
the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting its internal systems 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by the end of the second quarter of depending on the systems affected  these plans could include  a accelerated replacement of affected equipment and software  b short to medium term use of back up equipment and software  c increased work hours for the company personnel or use of contract personnel to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and d other similar approaches
