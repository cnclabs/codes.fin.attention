the company takes into consideration a number of factors in measuring its liquidity  including the ratios set forth below current ratio to to to sales to receivables to to to total debt to equity 
to to 
to as of june   the company had no material commitments for purchases or capital expenditures 
working capital 
working capital increased by  to  at june  from  at june  the additional working capital was generated primarily from the increase in accounts receivable and the decrease in income taxes payable resulting from the benefit from income taxes  which was partially offset by the company s reduction in its inventory  all as discussed below 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased by  to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted primarily from the increase in sales during the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter in fiscal inventory 
inventory was reduced by  to  at june  as compared to  at june  the company generated a significant reduction in its inventory during the year ended june  due in part to its efforts at improving various planning and forecasting techniques as well as the high sales levels achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by  to  at june  from  at june  this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in component part purchases  which was a direct result of the improved planning and forecasting as discussed above 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal increased by to  from  in fiscal the company achieved this sales level in fiscal mainly through the increased sales in the fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter of fiscal sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal were  as compared to  in this increase was due primarily to a significant increase in the demand of the company s door locking products as well as increased orders from a major customer who returned to a more normal inventory position of the company s products after tightening these levels during their acquisition of another company 
these increases more than offset the decrease in sales during the first three quarters of fiscal which were affected  in part  by the major customer as discussed above 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit increased  to  or of net sales in fiscal as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the company s improvement in its component costs 
expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to  or of net sales from  or of net sales in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the increased selling and marketing expenses relating to the increased sales of the company s door security products as well as the introduction of the company s new fire and access control products 
other expenses 
other expenses in fiscal increased by  to  as compared to  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from increased borrowings related to the repurchase of common shares at the end of fiscal income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes increased  to a benefit of  during fiscal this compared to a benefit of  during fiscal the increase in the benefit for fiscal is primarily attributable to the favorable outcome of the irs audits of fiscal years through and the resulting impact on related reserve requirements 
effects of inflation 
during the three year period ended june   inflation and changing prices did not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales in fiscal decreased approximately  or to  from  in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of pricing pressures and the decreased sales to one major customer  as previously disclosed 
these decreases were offset  in part  by increased export sales as well as the markets continued favorable reception of the company s hybrid hard wired wireless products and digital locks 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit decreased  to  or of net sales in fiscal as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the pricing pressures and reduction in net sales as discussed above as partially offset by reduced material and freight costs 
expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased slightly to  or of net sales from  or of net sales in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s expansion of its international sales operations and related informational systems as partially offset by continuing cost saving efforts 
other expenses 
other expenses in fiscal decreased by  to  as compared to  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased interest expense resulting from more favorable interest rates available to the company as well as more favorable foreign currency transaction rates realized by the company during the year as partially offset by increased borrowings 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased  to a benefit of  during fiscal this compared to a provision of  or approximately of income before provision for income taxes during fiscal the decrease in the provision for fiscal was primarily attributable to the reversal of  of reserves no longer required with respect to an irs audit of fiscal years through effects of inflation 
during the three year period ended june   inflation and changing prices did not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
by laws the board of directors amended the company s by law provision on indemnification of officers and directors to make it more detailed as to the circumstances for such indemnification and the company entered into an indemnification agreement with the directors 
year date conversion as the century turns from to  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or not at all 
this results primarily because of the conventional use of a two digit date field in most software applications 
the inability to properly recognize the year may cause systems to process financial and operational information incorrectly 
the company believes that virtually all of the company s systems are now fully compliant 
due to the fact that the company s primary software supplier includes the year upgrade as part of its ongoing maintenance  the company expects to expend a minimal amount of its resources in this area 
although the company expects its critical systems to be compliant  there is no guarantee that these results will be achieved 
specific factors that give rise to this uncertainty include a possible failure to identify all susceptible systems  noncompliance by third parties whose systems and operations impact the company  and other similar uncertainties 
in addition to internal year remediation activities  the company is in contact with key suppliers and customers to reduce the likelihood of any significant interruption in the business between the company and these important third parties relating to the year issue 
a comprehensive survey of all vendors and customers has not been made and is not presently planned 
the company s efforts thus far have been focused on key vendors and customers 
if these third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that its actions with key suppliers and customers will minimize these risks 
the vast majority of the company s products are not date sensitive 
the company has collected information on current and discontinued date sensitive products 
at this time  the company does not have in place a comprehensive  global contingency plan relative to potential year disruptions 
rather  each significant system with a potential problem either has been repaired and tested or is being updated 
contingency plans for certain types of unforeseen problems are being developed 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term debt consisting of a revolving credit and term loan facility that provides for interest at a spread above the prime rate 
the company is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under this credit facility 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
at june   an aggregate principal amount of approximately  was outstanding under the company s credit facility and term loan with a weighted average interest rate of 
if principal amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and the prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by the company would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest that year 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
where appropriate  the company requires that letters of credit be provided on foreign sales 
in addition  a significant number of transactions by the company are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the company has shifted foreign currency exposure onto its foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  the company could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
