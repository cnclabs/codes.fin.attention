item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with security capital s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item of this report 
forward looking statements and risk factors the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  management s beliefs  and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
security capital undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
security capital s financial performance depends on the operating results of the capital division investees and the financial services division 
among the important factors that could cause security capital s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements are i changes in general economic conditions that would affect the operating results of the capital division investees or the revenues earned by the financial services division  ii changes in financial markets and interest rates that could adversely affect security capital and the capital division s investees cost of capital and their ability to meet their financing needs and obligations  iii increased or unexpected competition for the capital division s investees  iv changes in capital markets generally or the market for real estate securities specifically that could affect the revenues earned by the financial services division  v impact of rapid growth on security capital  including management and staffing  and vi changes in tax laws that could affect the capital division s investees which operate as reits 
the following matters may affect security capital s future financial performance 
reliance on dividends and transfers from  and earnings of  companies in which security capital invests security capital conducts all of its operations through financial service business subsidiaries and real estate operating companies in which it has an investment 
security capital is dependent on dividends and fees it receives from these companies to meet its operating expense needs and to pay principal and interest on its debt 
security capital s results of operations are affected by the results of operations of these companies 
although security capital has influence over the real estate operating companies in which it invests because of its significant ownership interest and contractual rights  it has a non majority ownership interest in many of these companies and there are significant third party shareholders  often with substantial aggregate ownerships  in other companies 
accordingly  security capital s ability to control these companies or cause them to make distributions or other payments to security capital or its ability to affect the financial performance of these companies may be limited 
dependence on key personnel security capital s success depends on its ability  and the ability of the companies in which it invests  to attract and retain the services of executive officers  senior officers and company managers 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate  capital management and capital markets industries 
security capital believes it has effective succession plans in place  and that several of its officers could serve as its senior executive officers and continue its performance  but the loss of any of these key personnel could have an adverse effect on security capital 
leverage as of december   security capital had approximately billion of consolidated outstanding long term indebtedness of which million represented indebtedness of security capital s consolidated subsidiaries and million of consolidated outstanding short term indebtedness of which million represented indebtedness of security capital s consolidated subsidiaries 
in addition  many of the companies in which security capital has a direct or indirect investment have a substantial amount of indebtedness and  in certain cases  have issued preferred stock to third parties 
based on security capital s current level of operations and anticipated growth as a result of new business initiatives  security capital anticipates being able to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements for operations and currently committed investments for existing businesses for the next twelve months 
the source of this cash is expected to be cash flow from operations and funds available under its unsecured line of credit 
if security capital were to enter new businesses  or expand its investment materially in existing businesses  such investments would be financed through selective sales from time to time of existing assets or through the proceeds of the offering of equity and debt securities and borrowings under its unsecured line of credit  which could be refinanced with the issuance of long term debt or equity securities 
security capital anticipates that its operating companies will separately finance their activities through cash flow from operations  sales of equity and debt securities and the incurrence of mortgage debt or line of credit borrowings 
the degree to which security capital is leveraged and to which it is able to meet its financial obligations could affect its ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments in new businesses or general corporate purposes 
borrowing risks debt financing risks to the extent security capital or its investees incur debt  security capital will be subject to the risks associated with debt financing 
these risks include the risks that security capital or an investee will not have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet required payments of principal and interest  that security capital or its investees will be unable to refinance current or future indebtedness  that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness and that security capital or its investees will be unable to make necessary investments in new business initiatives due to lack of available funds 
security capital does not guarantee the indebtedness of any of its investees 
if security capital uses securities of its investees to secure its indebtedness  and if security capital is unable to make required payments on that indebtedness  the securities could be transferred to the lender with a consequent loss of income and asset value to security capital 
if any of security capital s investees mortgages a property owned by it to secure indebtedness  and the company is unable to make its required payments on that indebtedness  the property would be transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value to that company 
security capital s policy will be generally to arrange unsecured  fixed rate long term debt 
certain of its investees may incur selective mortgage debt which provides greater long term value 
variable interest rate risk increases in interest rates could increase security capital s interest expense  which would adversely affect security capital s net earnings and cash available for payment of obligations 
at december   security capital and its consolidated subsidiaries had million of variable interest rate borrowings outstanding on their lines of credit and a million variable interest rate mortgage note payable outstanding 
availability of capital during the last half of and continuing into  the prices for real estate company equity securities generally declined and real estate companies experienced a reduced supply of favorably priced equity and debt capital 
this has resulted in a decreased level of new investment activity by many real estate companies  including investees of security capital 
although security capital believes these capital constraints will positively affect supply demand situations in certain sectors  a prolonged period in which real estate companies cannot effectively access the equity capital markets may affect the ability of security capital and its investees to undertake new business initiatives  may adversely affect the growth of security capital and its investees and could affect the ability of security capital and its investees to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms 
conflicts of interest allocation of new business opportunities security capital will deploy its capital both its corporate and third party managed capital through investments in public and private companies with highly focused business strategies and which are engaged in real estate related activities 
the allocation of new business opportunities may present conflicts between security capital and its investees 
security capital will generally present new opportunities in existing property types within the united states  for example  apartment communities or distribution space  to its investees which are engaged in owning and operating those types of properties 
security capital will generally allocate long term strategic investment opportunities in equity oriented reits located in the united states  which are not engaged in operating property types in which security capital currently owns a strategic position  to sc usrealty 
security capital expects to pursue directly all other investment opportunities in unrelated real estate operating companies located in the united states  and it may form new entities to develop those opportunities 
interests of certain directors and officers in companies in which security capital has an investment several of security capital s directors or senior officers are directors or trustees of the companies in which security capital has a direct or indirect investment 
several of these directors and officers also own shares of security capital s stock and shares of the stock of companies in which security capital has an investment 
from time to time there may be transactions between security capital and the companies in which it has an investment or among the companies in which it has an investment 
the interests of the persons described above may differ from the interests of security capital s shareholders as a result of their positions in the companies in which security capital has an investment or their ownership of securities of the companies in which security capital has an investment 
as a result  those persons may have an incentive to place the interests of the companies in which security capital has an investment over the interests of security capital 
principal transactions with officers  directors and investees of security capital security capital has engaged in transactions with certain of its officers and directors or companies in which one of its directors may have a material interest 
security capital will not borrow from or make loans to affiliates  other than loans to officers or loans to affiliates in which it owns a substantial economic interest  or where its board of directors believes that the loans are in its and its shareholders best long term interests 
in those cases where security capital engages in these types of transactions  it has obtained or will obtain  after appropriate disclosure of all material interests  board of directors approval for officer transactions  disinterested director approval for interested director transactions and  where appropriate under maryland law or required by its charter or bylaws  shareholder approval 
neither security capital s charter nor its bylaws contain any restrictions on interested party transactions with directors and officers 
under the laws of maryland where security capital is organized  each director is obligated to offer to security capital any opportunity with certain limited exceptions which comes to him and which security capital could reasonably be expected to have an interest in developing 
in addition  under maryland law  any contract or other transaction between security capital and a director or an entity in which the director has a material financial interest is voidable unless i it is approved  after disclosure of the interest  by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested directors or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by disinterested shareholders or ii it is fair and reasonable to security capital 
transactions with companies in which security capital has a direct investment have been and will be considered  after appropriate disclosure of all material interests by security capital s entire board of directors 
security capital owns substantial positions in the companies in which it has a direct investment which  together with certain investor agreements  advisory agreements  board representation or other control rights  allows it to exert significant influence over the operations of each of these entities 
sc usrealty and sc european realty generally have investor agreements and board representation for companies in which security capital has an indirect investment 
certain risks relating to the investment company act security capital is not registered under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  in reliance on an exemption provided by rule a issued under the investment company act 
security capital is not required to register as an investment company because security capital is principally engaged in the real estate business through companies which it primarily controls 
significant stock ownership generally or greater  investor agreements  advisory agreements  board representation and other control rights allow security capital to exert significant influence over the operations of each of these entities 
security capital intends to exert similar influence over any other operating company in which it makes future investments 
however  to the extent security capital and its affiliates do not elect to participate in future equity offerings by the companies in which security capital has an investment or such companies issue substantial additional equity securities in a business combination to unaffiliated parties  security capital s ownership interest in and control over those companies could diminish 
under these circumstances  security capital could potentially be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act 
security capital would be materially adversely affected if it were required to register as an investment company under the investment company act 
real estate investment risks general the return which security capital achieves from real estate operating companies in which it has an investment is dependent on the performance of the real property investments held by those companies  which are subject to varying degrees of risk 
real estate cash flows and values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local  regional or national conditions such as an oversupply of properties or a reduction in rental demand in a specific area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available properties and the ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and to control operating costs 
although security capital seeks to minimize these risks through its market research and asset and property management capabilities  it cannot eliminate these risks 
real estate cash flows and values are also affected by such factors as government regulations  including zoning  usage and tax laws  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  the possibility of bankruptcies of tenants  potential liability under environmental and other laws  and changes in environmental and other laws 
since a significant portion of the income from the reits in which security capital has an investment is derived from rental income and other payments from real property  their income and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of their tenants were unable to meet their obligations  or if they were unable to lease properties on economically favorable terms 
risks of real estate development certain companies in which security capital has an investment have developed or commenced development on properties and expect to develop additional properties in the future 
real estate development involves significant risks in addition to those involved in the ownership and operation of established properties  including the risks that financing  if needed  may not be available on favorable terms for development projects  that construction may not be completed on schedule resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  that estimates of the costs of construction may prove to be inaccurate and that properties may not be occupied  leased or rented on profitable terms 
these risks may cause the development to fail to perform as the company expected 
timely construction may be affected by local weather conditions  local or national strikes and by local or national shortages in materials  insulation  building supplies or energy and fuel for equipment 
renewal of leases and re leasing of space certain of the companies in which security capital has a direct or indirect investment are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed  space may not be re leased or the terms of the renewal or re leasing may be less favorable than current lease terms 
if those companies are unable to promptly renew leases or re lease or if the rental rates upon the renewal or re lease are significantly lower than expected  their cash flow  and accordingly security capital s cash flow  may be adversely affected 
illiquidity of real estate investments equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore may tend to limit the ability of the real estate operating companies in which security capital has an investment to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with equity investments such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and operating and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
further  the reits in which security capital has an investment must comply with tax rules which enable them to avoid punitive taxation 
thus  the ability of those reits to sell assets to change their asset base is restricted by tax rules which impose holding periods for assets and potential disqualification as a reit upon certain asset sales 
changes in laws real estate operating companies in which security capital has an investment generally may not be able to pass increased costs resulting from increases in real estate  income or transfer taxes or other governmental requirements directly to residents  tenants or lessees 
this may inhibit the ability of those companies to recover those costs 
substantial increases in rents  as a result of those increased costs  may affect the ability of a resident  tenant or lessee to pay rent  causing increased vacancy 
changes in laws increasing potential liability for environmental conditions or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures 
security capital can give no assurance that new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the laws with respect to the qualification as reits of certain of the companies in which security capital has an investment  or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification to those companies 
uninsured loss the real estate operating companies in which security capital has an investment carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood  earthquake  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to their properties 
this insurance has policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
the real estate operating companies believe these specifications and limits are appropriate under the circumstances 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as from wars which may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  the real estate operating company could lose both its capital invested in and anticipated profits from one or more properties 
effects of changes in real estate company securities prices on security capital s results of operations changes in the prices of real estate company equity securities have and will impact security capital s results of operations 
security capital holds investments in certain investment entities holding publicly traded real estate company equity securities whose results of operations are included in security capital s results of operations 
therefore  security capital s results of operations are affected by the realized trading and investment results of these investment entities 
in addition  the global capital management group provides investment management services to various investment entities and separate accounts 
the fees earned by the global capital management group are generally based upon assets under management and therefore are affected by a reduction in the value of the securities held by the various investment entities and separate accounts 
these fees are based on advisory agreements which are subject to annual or bi annual review by independent directors of the advised entities  or in the case of separate accounts  are terminable on short notice 
the results of operations of security capital are also affected by the level of fees generated by capital markets 
these fees depend upon the number and size of transactions handled by capital markets  which may vary from period to period 
during the last half of  prices of real estate company equity securities generally declined  which adversely affected security capital s operating results 
overview security capital is a global real estate research  investment and operating management company 
security capital obtains income from five sources the capital division s share of earnings from its investees  capital markets revenues  corporate services revenues for information technology  accounting and administrative services  global capital management group revenues and real estate research revenues 
revenues from corporate services  capital markets  global capital management group and real estate research are all included in the financial services division and are only reflected in security capital s consolidated financial statements if they were earned from investees not consolidated in the financial statements 
financial services division revenues earned from consolidated investees homestead  sc us real estate shares  sc european real estate shares and  during  atlantic are eliminated in security capital s consolidated financial statements 
sc usrealty and sc european realty  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  account for their investments at market value or estimated fair value depending on whether the investment is publicly traded and reflect changes in such values in their statements of income pursuant to fair value accounting principles 
security capital accounts for its investment in sc usrealty and sc european realty using the equity method and  as a consequence  security capital s results of operations are affected by changes in the fair value of sc usrealty s and sc european realty s investments 
sc usrealty values its investments in publicly traded companies at market determined by using closing market prices as of the relevant balance sheet date 
sc usrealty and sc european realty value their investments in private companies at fair value  generally determined at cost  or an appropriate lower value if the investment is not performing as expected 
if substantial additional capital is raised by an investee from independent third parties in a private placement  sc usrealty and sc european realty value their investment at the price at which that capital was raised when a substantial percentage of the new subscriptions have been funded 
in addition  there are financial services division subsidiaries that are the operating advisors to sc usrealty and sc european realty and  for their services  earn advisory fees based on a percentage of the fair value of sc usrealty s and sc european realty s investments not including short term investments and investments in security capital 
sc us real estate shares and sc european real estate shares  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  account for their investments at market value and reflect changes in such values in their statements of income pursuant to fair value accounting principles 
security capital consolidates sc us real estate shares and sc european real estate shares  and as a consequence  security capital s results of operations are affected by changes in the fair value of their investments 
sc preferred growth  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  accounts for its investments at market value or estimated fair value depending on whether the investment is publicly traded 
security capital accounts for its investment in sc preferred growth using the equity method and  as a consequence  security capital s results of operations are affected by changes in the fair value of sc preferred growth s investments 
sc preferred growth makes intermediate term investments primarily in the convertible securities of real estate operating companies 
sc preferred growth values its investments in publicly traded securities at market determined by using closing market prices as of the relevant balance sheet date 
sc preferred growth values its investments in privately held securities by using closing market prices  as of the relevant balance sheet date  of an identical class of publicly traded securities if it exists 
the fair value of other privately held securities is determined by consistently applying policies and procedures which consider many factors 
as a result of accounting for these investments at market value  security capital s results of operations  as reflected under generally accepted accounting principles  have been and will be subject to substantial volatility from period to period 
results of operations compared to sale of reit and property managers prior to september  certain security capital financial services division subsidiaries managed the operations reit managers of and provided property management services property managers to various reits archstone  atlantic and prologis in which the capital division was a significant owner 
effective september   security capital exchanged the reit and property managers for additional common shares of archstone  shares  atlantic  shares and prologis  shares 
archstone and atlantic merger in july security capital pacific trust and atlantic merged to form archstone communities trust 
pursuant to the merger transaction  atlantic was merged into archstone 
in accordance with the terms of the merger  each outstanding atlantic common share was converted into one archstone common share and each outstanding atlantic series a preferred share was converted into one comparable archstone series c preferred share 
security capital remained archstone s largest shareholder 
capital division investments dividends received security capital s dividends received increased from million to million  a increase for the year ended december   compared to the increase resulted primarily from a the purchase of additional shares in prologis and sc us real estate shares  b additional shares received from archstone  atlantic and prologis in their acquisition of their reit and property management companies from security capital in september  c additional investments in sc preferred growth and d increases in the per share dividend rates of most of its investees see dividends per investee share chart in note to the consolidated financial statements 
equity in earnings of investees security capital includes in its earnings its share of the earnings of its unconsolidated investees 
the equity in earnings of sc usrealty and sc preferred growth and the earnings of sc us real estate shares and sc european real estate shares  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  include the change in unrealized gains or losses on their investments in their earnings 
this component of earnings or loss fluctuates with changes in the prevailing market prices for the shares of the real estate companies in which they invest 
the fluctuation in market prices does not have an impact on cash flow  but the general decline in real estate equity security prices during had a significant adverse impact on security capital s equity in earnings of these investees 
presented below is security capital s equity in earnings loss of affiliates for the years ended december  and  and security capital s common share ownership interest in affiliates as of december  and s in millions equity in earnings ownership loss as of year ended december december   archstone prologis sc european realty sc preferred growth sc usrealty strategic hotel the increase in security capital s equity in prologis earnings for the year ended december   is primarily due to the one time non cash expense of million  in september  related to prologis acquisition of its reit and property management companies from security capital  partially offset by interest rate hedge expense  increases in depreciation expense  preferred share dividends and lower relative ownership by security capital in additionally there was an increased number of distribution properties in operation in as compared to and increased rental rates on renewal leases for previously occupied space and an overall decrease in operating and general and administrative expenses 
the increase in security capital s equity in archstone s earnings for the year ended december   compared to  is primarily due to a one time non cash expense of million  in september  related to archstone s acquisition of its reit and property management companies from security capital  the merger of atlantic into archstone in july  and an increase in gains on dispositions of real estate 
the decrease in security capital s equity in sc usrealty s earnings for the year ended december   compared to  is primarily due to the change in unrealized gain or loss on investments million decrease in and a million increase in due to the decline in the market value of reit stocks generally  including those owned by sc usrealty 
sc usrealty s realized gains on its non strategic real estate portfolio investments decreased by million for the year ended compared to sc usrealty s net investment income defined as dividends and other investment income net of administrative expenses  advisor fees  taxes and interest increased by million for the year ended compared to the decrease in security capital s equity in sc preferred growth s earnings for the year ended december   compared to  is primarily due to a change in unrealized gain or loss on investments million decrease in and million increase in due to the decline in the fair value of stocks owned by sc preferred growth 
the decline in the real estate equity markets in may impact the near term ability of operating affiliates of security capital to access the equity and debt markets  which could adversely impact their ability to maintain their historical growth rates 
however  this should be partially mitigated by the affiliates ability to maximize the performance of their portfolio of operating properties 
room revenue and rental expenses from homestead homestead s room revenue increased from million to million  a increase for the year ended december   compared to homestead s rental expenses increased from million to million  a increase for the year ended december   compared to homestead s new property openings during and properties open for their first full year in were the primary reason for both the increases in room revenue and rental expenses 
at year end  homestead s development program included land sites owned 
homestead intends to finance the completion of the properties under construction with cash on hand  million borrowed under its working capital facilities described under lines of credit below in january  approximately million additional capacity available under its working capital facilities upon renewal  cash flow from operations  and with additional financing described below 
development of the land sites which includes sites in urban metropolitan areas is estimated at million 
homestead s ability to move into the construction phase of development on the owned sites is dependent upon homestead obtaining additional financing 
homestead is seeking funding to continue development of these sites and may seek additional lines of credit  issue debt or equity securities  or enter into other arrangements to provide for development of the properties 
however  there is no assurance that homestead will be able to obtain such financing when required or on acceptable terms 
if homestead cannot secure adequate funding or complete other development arrangements then it may have to discontinue the development process on some or all of the land sites owned resulting in expensing of carrying costs  such as interest and property taxes  and expensing costs of its internal development group 
similarly  if pursuits of some or all of the land sites are abandoned homestead may incur write offs of pursuit costs and loss of non refundable earnest money deposits 
if discontinuance of development of land sites is required or pursuits of land sites for acquisition are abandoned due to financing constraints  then homestead intends to mitigate incurrence of expenses and cash outflows by seeking to sell land sites  sell and assign rights to acquire sites under pursuit  terminate personnel  or take other appropriate actions  all of which may result in additional losses 
homestead expects that its results for the first quarter of will be below management s prior expectations 
lower than expected occupancy rates in certain markets has led to lower than expected revenues for certain properties 
lower than expected increases in occupancy rates for newly opened properties in the northeast and midwest  caused in part by adverse weather conditions  also are expected to impact revenues 
these lower than expected results may adversely affect security capital s results in financial services division revenues the components of financial services division revenues were as follows for the years ended december  and in millions capital markets corporate services global capital management real estate research reit and property management fees total financial services division revenues less amounts eliminated in consolidation consolidated financial services division revenues the decrease in financial services division revenues for the year ended december   compared to was primarily attributable to the september   sale of the archstone  atlantic and prologis reit managers and property managers substantially offset by a the growth in assets managed by global capital management shown in the following table  which generated increased advisory and management fees  b an increase in capital markets fees generated by transactions related to new affiliates  and c an increase in corporate services and real estate research services revenue 
the following table reflects the market value of assets under management by the global capital management group as of december  and in millions sc european realty  sc preferred growth sc usrealty   investment funds other growth in financial services division revenues is expected to come primarily from management and advisory revenues earned by the global capital management group and fees earned by corporate services and real estate research 
the decline in real estate security stock prices may make it more difficult to attract assets to the company s investment funds and investees which could  in turn  impact future revenue growth for the global capital management group or capital markets 
additionally  the decline in real estate securities prices in reduced the value of assets under management in closed end managed entities  thereby decreasing fee income to security capital for managing such entities 
any reduced growth could be partially offset by increases in other financial services revenues as security capital continues to expand in this area  although no assurance of this growth can be given 
realized capital gains losses realized capital gains decreased from net capital gains of million to net capital losses of million net of million adjustment for minority interest for the year ended december   compared to this decrease is due to the decrease in the market value of sc us real estate shares  sc european real estate shares and sc real estate arbitrage shares investments 
sc real estate arbitrage shares was closed as of december  change in unrealized gain or loss on investments the change in unrealized gain or loss on investments was a decrease of million in compared to an increase of million in the decrease in is due to the decrease in the market value of sc us real estate shares  sc european real estate shares and sc real estate arbitrage investments 
at december   sc us real estate shares had investments at cost and fair market value of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   sc european real estate shares had investments at cost and fair market value of approximately million and million  respectively 
other income  net other income increased from million to million for the year ended december   compared to the increase is primarily due to interest income on strategic hotel debentures and additional dividend income earned by the investment funds 
financial services division expenses financial services division expenses decreased from million to million  a decrease for the year ended december   compared to this decrease primarily resulted from the sale of the reit and property management companies  which incurred million of expenses for the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by increased personnel expenses and a million fourth quarter special charge which was incurred primarily due to a change in strategy related to the retail distribution of real estate investment funds  which resulted in a reduction of personnel and associated costs 
this change in strategy is expected to result in an annualized cost savings of approximately million 
general  administrative and other general  administrative and other expenses increased from million to million  a increase for the year ended december   compared to these increases resulted primarily from additional personnel and related costs and homestead s special charge related to a reduction in development activity 
security capital s share of homestead s fourth quarter special charge was million 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and  is summarized as follows in millions security capital homestead total convertible debentures lines of credit senior unsecured notes mortgage notes payable capitalized interest total interest expense on the convertible debentures decreased primarily due to the conversion of million principal amount of convertible debentures to class a common shares in the fourth quarter of the increase in security capital s line of credit interest expense is primarily due to increased weighted average borrowings 
the increase in homestead s net interest expense is due to increased investments in properties 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from million to million  a increase for the year ended december   compared to these increases primarily resulted from additional homestead property openings  and  to a lesser degree  additional computer hardware  software and office leasehold improvements in the financial services division 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for the year ending december   was less than 
this reduced rate reflects the impact of the unrecognized deferred tax benefit in consolidated subsidiaries and state and foreign taxes partially offset by a substantially lower tax rate on permanently invested earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for the year ending december   was affected primarily by the reversal of the valuation allowance applicable to net operating loss carryforwards  the value million assigned to the nondeductible warrants issued to archstone and prologis shareholders and the million non cash  non recurring charge see note to the consolidated financial statements 
preferred share dividends preferred share dividends increased from million to million for the year ended december   compared to this increase is due to the exchange of series a preferred shares and certain class b common shares for new series b preferred shares in may see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
extraordinary item the extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt  net of minority interest  in the amount of million for the year ended december   relates to the mortgage loan purchase agreement entered into by homestead with atlantic and merrill lynch mortgage capital inc mlmc 
see the description of this transaction in mortgage notes payable under liquidity and capital resources

however  there is no assurance that homestead will be able to obtain such financing when required or on acceptable terms 
if homestead cannot secure adequate funding or complete other development arrangements then it may have to discontinue the development process on some or all of the land sites owned resulting in expensing of carrying costs  such as interest and property taxes  and expensing costs of its internal development group 
similarly  if pursuits of some or all of the land sites are abandoned homestead may incur write offs of pursuit costs and loss of non refundable earnest money deposits 
if discontinuance of development of land sites is required or pursuits of land sites for acquisition are abandoned due to financing constraints  then homestead intends to mitigate incurrence of expenses and cash outflows by seeking to sell land sites  sell and assign rights to acquire sites under pursuit  terminate personnel  or take other appropriate actions  all of which may result in additional losses

mortgage notes payable homestead has million of convertible mortgage notes which are convertible  at the option of archstone  into shares of homestead common stock 
the conversion price is equal to one share of homestead common stock for every of principal amount outstanding 
on july   homestead entered into a mortgage loan purchase agreement with atlantic and merrill lynch mortgage capital inc mlmc whereby million of homestead convertible mortgage notes that were held by archstone were modified to  among other things  eliminate their convertibility feature in exchange for a payment of million from homestead to atlantic 
the amount paid to atlantic was based on trailing market prices of homestead common stock at the time the agreement was entered into  which exceeded the conversion price of the mortgage at that date 
homestead funded the payment with the proceeds received from the sale of million of convertible subordinated debentures 
also pursuant to the mortgage loan purchase agreement atlantic sold such modified notes to mlmc for million 
on august   homestead converted the million of mortgage notes and the million of convertible subordinated debentures into a million mortgage of a newly formed special purpose subsidiary of homestead 
the note was collateralized by homestead properties totaling million of historical cost at december  which were formerly collateral for the atlantic mortgage notes 
on february   of the properties were released from collateral as a result of the sale and leaseback agreement with hospitality properties trust discussed above 
the million mortgage note was due to mature on june  subject to extension by the holder of the mortgage notes  and provided for interest only monthly payments of libor plus through september   libor plus through november  and libor plus thereafter

such loss on extinguishment of debt and transaction costs amounted to million and was recorded as an extraordinary item in the third quarter of the million of indebtedness was repaid in february with a portion of the proceeds of the sale and leaseback transaction between homestead and hospitality properties trust 
convertible debentures at december   security capital had approximately million principal amount of convertible debentures outstanding 
the convertible debentures accrue interest at an annual rate of and require semi annual cash interest payments 
the principal amount of the convertible debentures are convertible into class a common shares at  per share compared to a december   nyse closing price of per share at the option of the holder 
the convertible debentures became convertible on september  security capital may redeem the convertible debentures at any time after march   in whole or in part  at par plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
earnings before depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes ebdadt fully converted ebdadt increased from million to million  a increase for the year ended december   primarily due to increased investments in the capital division 
ebdadt represents net earnings computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles before gains losses on dispositions of depreciated property  plus real estate deprecation and amortization  plus deferred tax expense  plus ebdadt net of dividends received by sc usrealty and sc european realty from their strategic investees  plus unrealized losses  minus unrealized gains  and plus other non cash  non recurring items 
management considers ebdadt to be the appropriate measure of its ownership of real estate enterprises  as it most clearly reflects the impact of both operating performance and capital structure 
with respect to security capital investees in which security capital has less than a interest  and does not have the ability to significantly influence management  security capital includes only dividends or interest received in its ebdadt 
sc usrealty and sc european realty use the same approach for investees in which they own less than 
ebdadt is not to be construed as a substitute for net earnings in evaluating operating results nor as a substitute for cash flow in evaluating liquidity 
presented below is a reconciliation of net earnings loss to ebdadt for the years ended december   and in thousands net earnings loss attributable to common shares    investee reconciling items real estate depreciation    gain on sale of depreciated real estate    unrealized gains losses    loss on sale of management companies  ebdadt  net of dividends  from strategic investees of sc usrealty and sc european realty    interest rate hedge expense  loss on extinguishment of debt   other    security capital reconciling items deferred tax benefit expense    convertible debenture interest expense    series a preferred share dividends    gain on sale of management companies  pro forma effect of the sale of the reit and property management companies   other  fully converted ebdadt    year issue the year issue has arisen because many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the following disclosure provides information regarding the current status of security capital s year compliance program 
security capital has been working on the year issue since july security capital and most of its affiliates have had action programs since that time to certify or replace all technology systems that might be affected  including embedded systems such as elevators and hvac equipment 
as of march   security capital has either certified or replaced all of its critical systems with year compliant systems 
the remaining non critical systems are expected to be upgraded or replaced by june among security capital s affiliates three have certified all of their systems  the other affiliates are in various stages of conversion to year compliant systems 
the latest expected date for full compliance is july security capital  as a real estate research  investment and operating management company  believes that it has relatively modest potential exposure to year issues 
security capital intends to focus its efforts to ensure that none of its affiliates will encounter the year issue  including providing direct and indirect assistance to those companies 
the majority of the operating and financial management functions of the affiliated operating companies supported by computer systems are billing tenants and leasing space 
neither of these functions is likely in the worst case scenarios to represent a serious financial impact since they could be manually corrected or circumvented without significant revenue loss to the affiliated operating companies 
exposure to embedded system problems in elevators  hvac  access control and refrigeration systems for affiliated operating companies is expected to be minimal 
most of these systems are no more than years old and partially completed surveys conducted by affiliates show that these systems are already compliant or can be readily upgraded to year compliant versions 
most of the potential costs for determining compliance of embedded systems is due to the internal and external staffing costs to identify  survey and test each system 
assessing suppliers readiness for year has not been completed 
security capital and its affiliates have numerous properties throughout the united states and in europe and mexico serviced by many generic service providers such as utilities and telecommunications 
in general  tenants have individual contracts for generic services  so security capital s affiliates exposure is generally limited to common area facilities 
security capital and its affiliates have little influence over utility providers and local exchange carriers  however  security capital expects little potential risk in this highly scrutinized area 
specialty as opposed to commodity services providers such as banks and benefit administration companies have responded to surveys stating that they expect to be year compliant early in security capital and its affiliates will perform tests of these systems during the first half of but expect no major problem or exposure from any of the specialty service providers 
there are no commodity or specialty services provided to security capital or its affiliates that are believed to represent a material risk or result in a material adverse financial impact in the most likely worst case scenario 
security capital provides shared service functions to a number of affiliated companies 
these services include accounting  cash management  human resources and benefits administration  information systems  internal audit  risk management and tax planning and compliance services 
all of the internal computer systems used to provide these services are year compliant  with the exception of payroll for one affiliate and depreciation accounting  both of which are expected to be converted to compliant systems in the near future 
outside suppliers of services that support the shared service functions  such as banks that perform electronic funds transfers  have been surveyed to determine their year compliance level 
the survey process has not been completed  but all respondents so far have stated that they are year compliant  and security capital believes that there are no outside suppliers that have not yet responded that represent a material risk to the provision of shared services to its affiliates 
the survey of suppliers is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of all of the major systems used by security capital are year compliant  specifically the corporate accounting  mutual fund management and cash management systems 
security capital is a tenant in a number of office buildings in the united states and europe 
landlord and supplier surveys for those buildings are not yet complete  but no material impact is expected to be caused by building related problems 
third party costs to address the year issue have been less than  to date and are not expected to exceed  in any likely worst case scenario 
security capital s internal costs incurred for year compliance issues have been less than  to date 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs of its information technology group 
security capital s investment in new accounting  payroll and cash management systems is due to rapid growth over the last five years and a desire to automate a greater number of processes  and is not attributable to year issues 
however  in considering and implementing these new systems  security capital believes it took all appropriate steps to ensure that these new systems are year compliant 
contingency plans to deal with unexpected and undetected problems caused by the year issue are focused on manual correction and rework 
no material revenue loss is expected to be caused by late billings or accounting entries 
potential liabilities to third parties would be limited to private and public investors  because security capital is not providing management or operating real estate 
there is no reasonably likely worst case known or apparent to security capital that would result in a material liability to a third party 
the risk of increased cost or lost revenue in the event of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is not expected to be material in any series of events or potential problems caused by the year issue  either for security capital directly or to any of its affiliated companies 
there can be no assurance that the year issue remediation by security capital and its affiliates or third parties will be properly and timely completed and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on security capital  its business and its financial condition 
security capital cannot predict the actual effects to it of the year issue  which depends on numerous uncertainties  many of which are outside its control  such as i whether significant third parties  such as banks and utilities  properly and timely address the year issue and ii whether broad based or systemic economic failures may occur 
security capital will continue to monitor these issues through its year compliance program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk security capital s exposures to market risks consist of interest rate risks related primarily to its variable rate line of credit  equity price risks related to its investments in marketable equity securities and interest rate risk related to its consolidated investment in homestead described below 
security capital s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objective  security capital borrows on a long term basis primarily at fixed rates and staggered maturities with its primary interest rate risk being related to its variable rate line of credit 
security capital has in the past  and intends in the future  to occasionally utilize derivative financial instruments as hedges in anticipation of future long term debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk exposure 
security capital had no outstanding interest rate hedges as of december  or security capital manages its equity price risks by limiting the percentage of its assets invested in marketable equity securities for trading purposes 
as of december  and  less than and less than  respectively  of total assets were invested in marketable equity securities that were available for sale 
sensitivity analysis during the year ended december   security capital had weighted average outstanding borrowings of million on its million variable rate line of credit 
if interest rates had been higher during  interest expense on the line of credit would have increased million to million 
as of december   security capital held million of publicly traded real estate securities at market value through its consolidated investment funds  sc us real estate shares and sc european real estate shares 
these securities have exposure to price risk 
a hypothetical decrease in quoted market prices would amount to a decrease in the recorded value of investments of approximately million 
homestead s interest rate risk homestead s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its line of credit facilities and variable rate mortgage note debt 
homestead has no involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the table below presents the i effective interest rates  ii expected maturity principal repayment schedules  iii carrying values  and iv estimated fair values for homestead s interest rate sensitive liabilities as of december  expected maturity principal repayment december  effective interest total fair rate thereafter balance value interest sensitive liabilities lines of credit facilities variable rate    convertible mortgage notes fixed rate    mortgage note payable variable rate    other long term obligation fixed rate   on march   homestead renewed and amended its lines of credit working capital facilities  outstanding in the above amounts  including an extension of their maturity to december  additionally  on march   homestead initiated a rights offering for million of common stock  the proceeds of which will be used to repay homestead s million bridge facility and for purposes allowed under homestead s working capital facilities 
the million mortgage note scheduled to mature june was repaid with the proceeds of a sale lease back transaction on february
