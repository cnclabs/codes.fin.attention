com e profile  designed to provide financial services providers with the ability to offer differentiated direct banking services to customers through a dedicated e banking service utility

these amounts will vary depending upon the applicable revenue components subject to such fees 
for the year ended december   this expense category declined by  or  relative to the level

year the company recognizes the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by year failures 
accordingly  the company has been actively evaluating the impact of the year on both its profile product line as well as its internal systems and hardware 
relative to the profile product line  all versions of profile sold and installed since late are year compliant upon completion of installation and testing by the clients 
further  due to system retrofits provided for the company s canadian credit union clients during and early  the company believes that these systems will be year compliant upon completion of installation and testing by the clients 
the cost to the company of the canadian version retrofits was approximately  all other clients using software installed prior to late are entitled to receive a version of the software which is year compliant as part of their software support agreements with the company  and they have been encouraged to upgrade 
for the most part  these clients have upgraded or otherwise remediated or are scheduled to upgrade in a timely manner 
to the extent the company is directly involved in any such upgrade process  the client pays for professional services and expenses 
accordingly  the company believes it will not be materially impacted by the year situation relative to any of its product offerings 
as to its own internal software systems and hardware  including it and non it systems  the company has identified and reviewed all key areas  and believes that there is no significant exposure to the year issue 
the cost of upgrading or replacing certain non compliant hardware and software for the remaining non critical functions is estimated to be less than  these upgrades and replacements should be completed by mid in light of the above information  the company does not anticipate any significant year problems 
the company will  however  continue to assess this situation and develop contingency plans as necessary 
the company s expectations with respect to these year issues are based on the assumption that there will be no general failure of external systems  including power  communications  transportation  or financial systems  necessary for the ordinary conduct of business 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december  cash flow from operations for was million   in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in were primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable days sales outstanding decreased from days at december  to days at december  and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income from operations 
the significant receivable reduction in is due to approximately million in contract payments received in december 
in addition  the receivable balance at december was unusually high due to new contracts closing and the achievement of several milestones on other contracts  resulting in significant billings late in the year 
partially offsetting these sources of funds was the decrease in deferred revenues 
the cash provided by operations in from net earnings and non cash expenses were offset by increases in accounts receivable and contracts in process 
net cash used in operating activities during was mainly attributable to increases in contracts in process and accounts receivable  partially offset by net earnings and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenues 
the company continues to expect a certain amount of variability in the timing of payment of major contract milestones which will impact cash flow from operations during any given period 
the company s business is generally not capital intensive 
capital asset expenditures for amounted to million as compared to million in the increase in capital expenditures during is attributable to purchases of equipment and furniture required by the significant growth in employees during the year  as well as the leasehold improvements completed to accommodate the additional staff 
the company s initial public offering in december generated net proceeds of million 
the company currently anticipates that cash generated from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to satisfy its operating and capital cash needs for the foreseeable future and at a minimum through the next year 
should the company s business expand more rapidly than expected  the company believes that additional bank credit  if necessary  would be available to fund such operating and capital requirements 
in addition  the company could consider seeking additional public or private debt or equity financing to fund future growth opportunities 
the company believes that its business is generally not seasonal  however  the company has historically experienced  and can be expected to continue to experience  a certain degree of variability in its quarterly revenue  earnings and cash flow patterns 
this variability is typically driven by significant events which directly impact the recognition and billing of project related revenues 
examples of such events include the timing of new business contract closings and the initiation of product and service fee revenue recognition  one time payments from existing clients relative to license expansion rights required to process a greater number of customer accounts or expand the number of permitted users and completion of implementation project roll outs and the related revenue recognition 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long in the case of new clients and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of the project  length of contract negotiations and general economic conditions in a particular sales prospect s country of origin 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client projects  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as noted earlier  however  the company believes that over the course of time the ongoing monthly revenue stream associated with the e profile outsourcing alternative will result in more predictable quarter to quarter revenues 
forward looking statements the company s forward looking statements about its revenues  earnings and business development have been derived from its operating budgets and forecasts which are based upon detailed assumptions about many important factors 
several important factors may cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward looking statements made by the company 
these factors include the course of business in the financial services industry  competition among software companies serving that industry  the company s management of the long sales cycle for its products  the timing of new contract closings  the success of the company s e profile business model and other significant events of revenue recognition affecting the company s quarterly results  the development of the top tier  direct and emerging banking markets  market acceptance of the company s products within these markets and the company s ability to continue to improve its products
