year disclosure amerco is and has been working since to identify and complete the changes necessary to its existing computerized business systems to make these systems compliant for year processing 
the year processing problem is caused by currently installed computer systems and software products  including several used by amerco  being coded to accept only the last two digit entries in the date code field instead of four digits to indicate the year 
such programs may interpret the year to mean instead  producing erroneous information or date related computer failures 
amerco s date reliance functions related to the year and beyond  such as rental transaction processing and financial systems  may be adversely affected unless these computer systems are or become year compliant  on a timely basis 
replacing  upgrading or modifying key financial systems has been on going in the normal course of business 
amerco is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct  reprogram and test its systems for year compliance 
in particular  amerco has an outside consulting firm on site currently making the year compliance related modifications to existing systems 
the assessment phase is complete for information technology 
amerco s internal information technology conversion phase is underway  with the testing phase going on at the same time 
amerco is also assessing its non information technology items for year compliance  such as rental vehicles and storage facilities security systems 
amerco is communicating with its major business partners to determine the efforts being made on their part for compliance 
critical vendors with electronic data interchange are currently being tested 
testing has been satisfactorily completed with major banking partners and credit card processors 
testing is expected to continue through the end of the summer with other business partners 
there can be no assurance amerco will not be adversely affected by the failure of others to become year compliant 
for example  amerco may be affected by  among other things  the failure of inventory suppliers  credit card processors  security companies or other vendors and service providers to become year compliant 
amerco expects all of its critical systems to be year compliant by the fall of calendar year amerco started with an initial budget of million  as the conversion process continues  it is now anticipated that an additional million may be incurred 
through march   million has been incurred 
amerco is accelerating the replacement of its payroll system due to year non compliance at an estimated cost of million to be incurred starting in september amerco has not deferred any major computer programming or update projects due to year efforts 
although amerco believes it will achieve compliance on a timely basis  no assurance can be given that amerco s computer systems will be year compliant by the fall of or otherwise in a timely manner or that amerco will not incur significant additional costs pursuing year compliance 
if the appropriate modifications are not made  or are not timely  the year problem may have a material adverse effect on amerco 
amerco considers its most likely worst case scenario to be if a business partner is not year compliant 
amerco is in the process of developing and refining contingency plans to be used if a business partner is not year compliant 
the contingency plans will include manual processing of rental transactions  manual preparation of payments to employees  vendors and claimants  manual licensing of equipment  manual preparation of financial statements and the movement of funds 
the contingency plans have been formulated  with refinement continuing until the year despite amerco s efforts to date  there can be no assurance that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on amerco in the future 
stockholder litigation as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on october   amerco paid the last portion of a total of approximately million to the plaintiffs non management members of the shoen family and their affiliates in full settlement of a long standing legal dispute involving the shoen family and related to control of amerco 
as a result  the plaintiffs that owned amerco stock were required to transfer all of their shares of common stock to amerco 
the total number of shares transferred was  an issue remains  however  regarding whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to statutory post judgment interest at the rate of ten percent per year from february  the date the director defendants filed for protection under chapter until the judgment was satisfied 
on july   the bankruptcy court ruled the plaintiffs are entitled to such interest 
the director defendants and amerco have appealed the court s decision 
amerco has deposited approximately million into an escrow account to secure payment of the disputed interest  pending final resolution of this issue including all appeals by either side 
the escrow account is reflected as a component of other assets in amerco s consolidated financial statements 
if the interest issue is decided adversely to amerco and the director defendants  the amount deposited into the escrow account will be transferred to the plaintiffs 
the ultimate outcome of this issue will not have the effect of increasing or decreasing amerco s net earnings  but could reduce stockholders equity 
amerco has deducted for income tax purposes approximately million of the payments made to the plaintiffs 
while amerco believes that such income tax deductions are appropriate  there can be no assurance that such deductions ultimately will be allowed in full 
other on october   amerco implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
it also provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of a the changes in the fair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or b the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
as of march   amerco recorded an after tax adjustment of million to accumulated other comprehensive income recognizing the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
amerco uses interest rate swap agreements to potentially mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
for the year ended march   amerco recognized thousand as interest expense  representing the ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedging activity 
at time of implementation  an entity may reclassify held to maturity securities as available for sale 
republic transferred million carrying value to available for sale from held to maturity at time of implementation 
the market value of these securities was million at the date of transfer with a transition adjustment of million 
other pronouncements issued by the financial accounting standards board adopted during the year are not material to the consolidated financial statements of amerco 
further  pronouncements with future effective dates are either not applicable or not material to the consolidated financial statements of amerco 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in the normal course of business  amerco is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
amerco manages such exposure by the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
amerco does not enter into leveraged financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
amerco s objective is to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
amerco uses interest rate swap agreements to provide for matching the gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a fluctuation of the interest rate by basis points would change amerco s interest expense by million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk amerco s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately of amerco s revenue is generated in canada 
the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would not be material 
amerco does not typically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is not considered material
