the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operation as a result of the acquisition of savane on june   the fiscal results of operations may not be comparable to prior years 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended october  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense bridge loan funding fee other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to an increase in units shipped and an increase in average selling price per unit  both of which were caused by the inclusion of savane s operations since the date of acquisition as well as increased market penetration and brand acceptance 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of net sales as compared with million or of net sales for fiscal the increase in gross margin was driven by a change in mix to higher margin products caused primarily by the inclusion of savane s higher margin branded product sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher advertising and brand support related expenses as well as higher general and administrative expenses associated with the savane operations 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to for fiscal the increase was due to the increase in average outstanding borrowings caused by the acquisition of savane  including savane s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the acquisition and the company s issuance of million of the notes  the proceeds of which were used to finance the acquisition of savane 
bridge loan funding fee 
the company entered into a million bridge financing facility to finance the savane acquisition until the closing of the offering of million of the notes 
the bridge loan funding fee of  was incurred to originate the bridge financing 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared with in fiscal net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase was attributable to a increase in the number of units shipped and a increase in the average selling price per unit 
these increases were primarily the result of increased market penetration and brand acceptance 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit percentage resulted primarily from a significant reduction in the level of markdowns 
during the first several weeks of fiscal  a significant number of orders were canceled due to the soft retail market experienced by most major retailers 
in an effort to control the cost of rising inventories and in anticipation of a continued weak retail market  the company sold products below its normal selling prices and in some cases below its cost 
also  the company recorded additional markdown allowances for any remaining excess inventory 
during the latter part of fiscal  the retail market strengthened and the level of markdowns decreased significantly 
this trend continued during fiscal and the gross profit percentage returned to historical levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was principally due to the overall increase in the level of operations of the company 
the principal components of the increase included  in distribution center labor   in depreciation and occupancy costs related to the company s new distribution center   in commissions and selling costs   in information technology costs   in merchandising costs   in certain legal expenses  and  in bad debts related to a customer bankruptcy 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was the result of higher average outstanding borrowings  offset in part by a lower average interest rate due to a re negotiation of the credit agreement in november income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared with in the comparable period in fiscal the increase in the effective rate for fiscal was primarily due to the company receiving in fiscal a benefit for previously unrecognized losses of an international subsidiary  which was closed in fiscal net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources prior to the acquisition of savane  the company s primary capital requirements have been the funding of the growth in operations and capital expenditures 
the company has historically financed its growth in sales and the resulting increase in inventory and receivables through a combination of operating cash flow and borrowings under its senior credit facility 
on june   the company closed on the facility  which provides for borrowings of up to million  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the facility was obtained in conjunction with the company s acquisition of savane and was used to refinance indebtedness then outstanding under the company s previous senior credit facility  to refinance indebtedness of savane  to pay fees incurred in connection with the acquisition of savane and with the facility  and for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility bear variable rates of interest at october  and are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets 
the facility matures in june as of october   excluding outstanding letters of credit of approximately million  an additional million was available for borrowings under the facility 
in addition  on june   the company closed a million bridge financing facility the bridge facility 
borrowings of million under the bridge facility and approximately million under the facility were incurred to finance the purchase price for the acquisition of savane  the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the company s and savane s former senior credit facilities and the redemption of million of savane s convertible subordinated debentures due as discussed below  debt under the bridge facility was repaid in full with the million of net proceeds from the offering and sale of the notes  together with borrowings of approximately million under the facility 
a funding fee of  was paid to the lender under the bridge facility  which was amortized to expense over the day life of the loan 
on june   the company closed the issuance and sale of million of the notes through a private placement 
under the terms of the indenture agreement underlying the notes  the company will pay semi annual interest at the rate of for ten years at which time the entire principal amount is due 
the net proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the bridge facility 
effective february   the company negotiated a reduction in the interest rate applicable to its real estate loan 
the loan now bears annual interest at  a decrease of from the previous rate of 
the new rate is fixed through july   at which time the rate will be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the loan agreement 
the company s credit agreements contain significant financial and operating covenants  including requirements that the company maintain minimum net worth levels and certain financial ratios  prohibitions on the ability of the company to incur certain additional indebtedness or to pay dividends  and restrictions on its ability to make capital expenditures 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants under its credit agreements 
pursuant to two separate factoring agreements the factoring agreements  the company factors substantially all of its accounts receivable 
the factoring agreements provide that the factor will pay the company an amount equal to the gross amount of the company s accounts receivable from customers  reduced by certain offsets  including among other things  discounts  returns and a commission payable by the company to the factor 
the commission ranges from 
to 
of the gross amount factored 
the factor subjects all sales to its credit review process and assumes of the credit risk for amounts factored pursuant to the factoring agreements 
funds are transferred to reduce outstanding borrowings under the facility once payment is received from the factor 
the factor pays the company the receivable amount upon the earlier of i receipt by the factor of payment from the company s customer or ii days past the due date for such payment 
the factoring agreements expire in as a result of the acquisition of savane in june  certain consolidation and cost savings activities have transpired that will impact the company s capital resources 
specifically  the company has chosen to exit certain owned or leased facilities or dispose of certain operations 
the sale of owned facilities will generate cash while the payment of lease termination costs or other exit costs including severance will utilize cash 
in november  the company disposed of savane s retail outlet stores to an unrelated third party 
under the terms of the sale  the buyer paid the company approximately million in cash  received approximately million in assets  and assumed approximately million in outstanding lease obligations 
during fiscal  the company used million of cash in its operations 
this was primarily the result of net income of million which included non cash charges of approximately million and an increase in accounts payable of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets of million and million  respectively 
the company has historically financed its capital expenditures through a combination of operating cash flow and long term borrowings 
capital expenditures were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the expenditures primarily relate to the upgrade or replacement of the company s existing equipment and computer systems including hardware and software and consulting fees related to the new system 
during fiscal  the company anticipates capital expenditures to total approximately million include completing the installation of its new computer system  the upgrading or replacement of other ancillary existing computer systems and the upgrading or replacement of certain existing equipment 
additionally  due to increases in volume  the company intends to add approximately  square feet to its distribution center in tampa 
at october  and at september   the company had working capital of million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital was due primarily to the working capital acquired with the acquisition of savane 
additionally  working capital was impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable 
the company expects its working capital needs will continue to fluctuate based on seasonal increases in sales and accounts receivable and seasonal decreases in trade accounts payable 
the company received million in proceeds from its initial public offering in october of the proceeds  million was used to redeem the company s preferred stock  million was used to reduce amounts outstanding under the facility and the remainder was invested for use in operations 
the company believes that the combination of existing working capital  funds anticipated to be generated from operating activities and the borrowing availability under the current and anticipated credit agreements will be sufficient to fund both its short term and long term capital and liquidity needs 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  reporting comprehensive income 
statement establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
comprehensive income  as defined  is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
the provisions of statement are effective for periods beginning after december  and adoption of statement is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  disclosures about segments of an enterprises and related information 
statement establishes standards for segment reporting and disclosure of additional information on products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the company is assessing implementation of the disclosure requirements of this standard which is effective for periods beginning after december  the adoption of statement may result in additional financial statement disclosure 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs and systems having been designed and developed to use two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
as a result  these computer programs and systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in fiscal  the company completed the evaluation and modification of all of its information technology systems with regard to the year issue 
the amount expensed by the company to accomplish this process was not material to the operations or financial condition of the company  and has been included in its entirety in the results of operations for fiscal the company believes that all of its information technology systems are now year compliant 
based on assessments made during fiscal and  savane decided to replace its entire inventory management  warehouse distribution and order processing systems so that those systems will be year compliant 
the new systems became operational in early december and therefore  all existing systems are now year compliant 
should there be any portions of the company s information systems that were overlooked in the remediation process  or become susceptible to the year subsequent to such remediation as the result of interaction with supplier or customer systems  or otherwise  the impact could be felt throughout the company s main operating system which includes subsystems related to customer analysis  order processing  planning  procurement  production and sales 
information technology plays a vital role in almost every aspect of the company s operations 
see business management information systems 
in addition  the year issue would strike at a time of the calendar year that is one of the company s busiest in terms of production and distribution 
while the company believes that it will be able to sustain normal operations even without any of its information technology systems  this could only continue for a short period of time 
the resources necessary to address any year issue which may arise will not be available entirely from internal personnel  and the company will be forced to contract with third party consultants 
at this time  the company does not have any such third party consultants under contract and does not anticipate that it will enter into any such contracts prior to the end of calendar further  the company does not anticipate that it will stockpile raw materials or inventory in advance of the end of calendar the worst case scenario for the company would occur if the new management information system currently being implemented was not operational at december  to plan for this possibility  and as noted above  the company current systems have been modified and are now year compliant 
based on the company current year compliant status  the company believes a contingency plan is not necessary 
the company has communicated with all significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
as of the date of this report  substantially all of the company s suppliers and customers have informed the company that their systems are or will be year compliant within the next six months 
if certain suppliers were not able to remediate their own year issues  it could affect the company s ability to order and receive raw materials shipments on a timely basis  which will have a direct and adverse impact on the company s production schedule 
this will then affect the company s ability to fill customer orders on a timely basis  the result of which may be a loss of customer sales 
in addition  if the company s customers do not remediate their systems  it could affect the company s ability to receive order information through edi and receive pos inventory information  both of which will also have a direct and adverse impact on the company s sales 
seasonality historically  the company s business has been seasonal  with slightly higher sales and income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  just prior to and during the two peak retail selling seasons for spring and fall merchandise 
in addition  certain of the company s products  such as shorts and corduroy pants  tend to be seasonal in nature 
in the event such products represent a greater percentage of the company s sales in the future  the seasonality of the company s sales may be increased 
euro conversion issue on january   of the member countries of the european union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rats between their existing currencies and the euro and to adopt the euro as their common legal currency the euro conversation 
the company has begun consideration of the effects of the euro conversation on its operations  but it is currently unsure of the potential impact that the euro conversion will have on its business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly as the euro conversation relates to the company s european operations 
risk factors affecting the company s business and prospects we must successfully integrate savane into our existing operations to remain profitable 
the acquisition of savane resulted in a significant increase in the scope of our business 
specifically  as a result of the acquisition of savane  we have significantly increased the total scale of our operations  including i the number of our branded and private brand apparel offerings  ii the number of our manufacturing and other operating locations  iii the number of our employees  and iv our geographical scope 
management must devote substantial attention and financial resources to address the coordination of our purchasing  distribution  manufacturing and warehousing for the combined companies  the coordination of our sales and marketing operations  and the implementation of appropriate financial and management systems 
our inability to successfully integrate savane in a timely and efficient manner could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect to realize certain cost savings and business synergies as a result of our acquisition of savane 
however  realization of these savings and synergies could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions  increased operating costs  the response of our competitors  customers or employees and regulatory developments 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the expected cost savings and business synergies 
to acquire savane we incurred a substantial amount of debt that will require successful future operating performance and financial results and may impose important limitations on us 
as a result of the acquisition of savane  we are highly leveraged 
the degree to which we are leveraged will have important consequences  including the following a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt and will not be available for other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired  our leverage may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures  our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities may be limited  and our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage in relation to less leveraged competitors 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future operating performance and financial results  which will be subject in part to factors beyond our control 
although we believe that our cash flow will be adequate to meet our interest and principal payments  there can be no assurance that we will generate earnings in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges 
if we are unable to generate earnings in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges and are unable to borrow funds from existing credit facilities or from other sources  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to sell all or a portion of our assets 
there can be no assurance that a refinancing would be possible  nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of any asset sales or the proceeds that we could realize therefrom 
in addition  the terms of the debt restrict our ability to sell assets and the use of the proceeds therefrom 
if for any reason  including a shortfall in anticipated operating results or proceeds from asset sales  we were unable to meet our debt service obligations  we would be in default under the terms of our existing debt 
in the event of such a default  some of our lenders could elect to declare certain debt to be immediately due and payable  including accrued and unpaid interest  and to their commitments to provide future funding 
in addition  such lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the debt  which consists of substantially all of our current and future personal property 
default on our senior debt obligation could result in a default under our other debt or result in bankruptcy 
the terms of our existing debt place significant restrictions on our ability to pursue financial and strategic opportunities 
the terms of our existing debt contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to dispose of assets  incur additional debt  repay other debt  pay dividends  make certain investments or acquisitions  repurchase or redeem capital stock  engage in mergers or consolidations  or engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates  and engage in certain corporate activities 
there can be no assurance that these restrictions will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  the terms of our existing debt require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these terms or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in our default under the terms of other debt or result in bankruptcy 
we may not be able to successfully identify  acquire and profitably operate companies and businesses that are compatible with our operations 
we continually evaluate the potential acquisition of other companies  brands and producers of complementary product lines 
our search may not yield any complementary companies or brands  and even if we do find a suitable acquisition we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund the purchase 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations of any company that we acquire into our own operations and we cannot assure you that the acquired operation will achieve the results we expected 
for example  the acquired business may not achieve revenues  profits or productiveness at the same levels as our existing operations 
the success of any acquisition will also depend upon our ability to retain or hire  and then train key personnel 
acquiring another company or business may also have negative effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition because our officers and directors may focus their attention on completing the acquisition  or because other resources may be diverted to fulfilling the needs of the acquisition 
we compete with other companies who have greater resources than we do for the opportunities to buy other companies and businesses and to expand our operations 
as a result  even if we do identify a suitable acquisition  we may lose the acquisition to a competitor who offers a more attractive purchase price 
at this time  we do not have any agreement or arrangement to buy any other company or business  or to expand our operations 
our financial success is linked to that of our customers  and to our customers commitment to our products 
our financial success is directly related to the success of our customers and the willingness of our customers  in particular our major customers  to continue buying our products 
the following chart shows who our major customers are  and the percentage of our net sales that their purchase of our products comprises percentage of our net sales for the year ended major customer october  wal mart price costco phillips van heusen we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
sales to our customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer or by us 
accordingly  the number of unfilled orders at any given time is not indicative of the number that will eventually be shipped 
if we cannot timely fill our customers orders  our relationships with our customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on us  especially if the relationship is with a major customer 
furthermore  if any of our major customers experiences a significant downturn in its business  or fails to remain committed to our programs or brands  then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

we are subject to changes in the apparel industry  including changing fashion trends and consumer preferences 
the apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations 
a recession in the general economy  or any other events or uncertainties that discourage consumers from spending  could have a significant effect on our sales and profitability 
we believe that our success is largely dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design  styling and production of our products 
if we cannot gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately  then consumers may not purchase our products and this would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
various apparel retailers  some our customers  have in recent years experienced financial problems 
many have been subject to bankruptcy  restructuring  or liquidation  while others have consolidated ownership and centralized buying decisions 
this increases our risk of extending credit to these retailers  and may lead us to reduce or discontinue business with such customers  or to assume more credit risk relating to their receivables 
either one of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

we compete with manufacturers and retailers in the highly competitive apparel industry 
we compete with many apparel manufacturers  including brand name and private label producers and retailers who have  or may have  the capability to develop their product and source their products internally 
our products are also in competition with many designer and non designer product lines 
our products compete primarily on the basis of price  quality  and our ability to satisfy customer orders in a timely manner 
our failure to satisfy any one of these factors could cause our customers to purchase products from our competitors 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial  manufacturing and distribution resources than we do 
if manufacturers or retailers increase their competition with us  or if our current competitors become more successful in competing with us  we could experience material adverse effects on our business  results of operations and financial condition

our use of our trademarks and trade dress may subject us to claims of infringement by other parties 
we use many trademarks in our business  some of which have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
we believe these registered and common law trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our competitive position and to our success 
the use and registration of our trademarks and the use of our trade dress are challenged periodically 
levi strauss co 
recently sued us  claiming  among other things  that a tsi trademark and the trade dress used in the labeling and packaging of certain of our products infringe on certain proprietary trademark and trade dress rights of levi strauss co 
the outcome of the litigation cannot be determined at this time 
nevertheless in an attempt to limit our liability  if any  we have unilaterally altered the trademark and trade dress which are the subject of the suit 
we cannot assure you  however  that the modifications made to the trademark and trade dress do not infringe on levi strauss co 
s rights 
it is possible that levi strauss co 
will continue to seek to recover damages and attorney s fees from us regarding the use of the trademark and trade dress  or regarding the use of the trademark and trade dress as modified 
see business legal proceedings 
despite our efforts to the contrary  our trademarks and proprietary rights may violate the proprietary rights of others 
if any of our trademarks or other proprietary rights were found to violate the proprietary rights of others  or were subjected to some other challenge  we cannot assure you that we would be permitted to continue using these trademarks or other proprietary rights 
furthermore  if we were sued for alleged infringement of another s proprietary rights  the party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims  and we could be forced to incur substantial costs to defend the litigation 
moreover  if the party claiming infringement prevails  we could be forced to pay significant damages  or to enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party 
pursuant to licensing agreements  we also have exclusive rights to use trademarks owned by other companies in promoting  distributing and selling their products 
we have periodically been involved in litigation regarding these licensing agreements 
we cannot assure you that these licensing agreements will remain in effect  or that they will be renewed 
in addition  any future disputes concerning these licenses may cause us to incur significant litigation costs or force us to suspend use of the trademarks

our success depends upon our ability to recruit qualified personnel and to retain senior management 
our continued success is dependent on retaining our senior management as well as attracting and retaining qualified management  administrative and sales personnel 
if we lose any members of our senior management  or if we do not recruit and retain other qualified personnel  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected

fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials we use could increase our cost of sales and reduce our ability to meet our customers demands 
the principal fabrics used in our apparel consist of cotton  wool  synthetic and blended fabrics 
the price we pay for these fabrics is mostly dependent on the market prices for the raw materials used to produce them  namely cotton  wool  rayon and polyester 
depending on a number of factors  including crop yields and weather patterns  the market price of these raw materials may fluctuate significantly 
moreover  only a limited number of suppliers are available to supply the fabrics at the level of quality we require 
if we have to procure fabrics from sources other than our current suppliers  the quality of the fabric may be significantly different from that obtained from our current suppliers 
fluctuations in the price  availability and quality of the fabrics or raw materials could increase our cost of sales and reduce our ability to meet our customers demands 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass along to our customers all  or any portion of  any increases in the prices paid for the fabrics used in the manufacture of our products 
see business production 
we depend upon independent manufacturers in the production of our apparel 
we use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce a substantial portion of our products 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the assembly or production of goods ordered and to maintain manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over these independent manufacturers  however  and so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of these independent manufacturers 
as a result  we cannot be assured of an uninterrupted supply of our product from our independent manufacturers 
if there is an interruption  we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers because such substitutes may not be available  or they may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality  at an acceptable price or on a timely basis 
see business production 
our ability to successfully conduct assembly and production operations in facilities in foreign countries depends on many factors beyond our control 
during fiscal  almost all of our products were assembled or produced by independent manufacturers in the dominican republic and mexico 
it is possible that we will experience difficulties with these independent manufacturers  including reduced production capacity  failure to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs as more fully discussed above 
also  using foreign manufacturers requires us to order products further in advance to account for transportation time 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may have to hold goods in inventory  and we may be unable to sell these goods at the same margins as we have in the past 
on the other hand  if we underestimate customer demand  we may not be able to fill orders in time 
other problems we may encounter by using foreign manufacturers include  but are not limited to o work stoppages  o transportation delays and interruptions  o delays and interruptions from natural disasters  o political instability  o economic disruptions  o expropriation  o nationalization  o imposition of tariffs  o imposition of import and export controls  o changes in government policies 
we also own a number of manufacturing facilities which operate outside the united states  and this subjects us to additional risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing facilities abroad 
for example  a facility operated in a foreign country may become subject to that country s labor laws and government regulations 
if the laws are unfavorable to our operations in any foreign country  we could experience a loss in revenues  customer orders and customer goodwill 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk 
in the past  most of our contracts to have goods assembled or produced in foreign countries were negotiated in united states dollars 
if the value of the united states dollar decreases  then the price that we pay for our products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to our customers 
see business production 
our products that are imported into the united states are subject to certain restrictions and tariffs 
most of our import operations are subject to bilateral textile agreements between the united states and a number of other countries 
these agreements establish quotas for the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the united states from these countries 
these agreements allow the united states  in certain circumstances  to impose restraints at any time on the importation of additional or new categories of merchandise 
future bilateral textile agreements may also contain similar restraints 
our imported products are also subject to united states customs duties 
the united states and the countries in which we manufacture our products may adjust quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions currently in effect 
there are no assurances that any adjustments would benefit us 
these same countries may also impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions 
furthermore  the united states may bar imports of products that are found to be made by convicts  or forced or indentured labor 
the united states may also withdraw the most favored nation status of certain countries  which could result in the imposition of higher tariffs on products imported from those countries 
all of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

our management information system is an integral part of our operations and must be updated regularly to respond to changing business needs 
we rely upon our management information system to provide distribution services and to track operating results 
we implemented a new  integrated management information system in and are still in the process of integrating additional functions 
further modification and refinement will be required as we grow and our business needs change 
if we experience a significant system failure or if we are unable to modify our management information systems to respond to changes in our business needs  then our ability to properly and timely produce and distribute our products could be adversely affected

our sales and income levels are seasonal 
our business has generally been seasonal  with higher sales and income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters  just before and during the two peak retail selling seasons for spring and fall merchandise 
also  some of our products  such as shorts and corduroy pants  tend to be seasonal in nature 
if these types of seasonal products represent a greater percentage of our sales in the future  the seasonality of our sales may be increased 
this could alter the differences in sales and income levels in the second and fourth fiscal quarters from the first and third fiscal quarters 
if we  our customers and suppliers are not year compliant  we may experience significant problems in several areas of our business 
in fiscal  the company completed the evaluation and modification of all of its information technology systems with regard to the year issue  and the company believes that all of its information technology systems are now year compliant 
should there be any portions of the company s information systems that were overlooked in the remediation process  or become susceptible to the year issue subsequent to such remediation as the result of interaction with supplier or customer systems or otherwise  the impact could be felt throughout the company s main operating system which includes subsystems related to customer analysis  order processing  planning  procurement  production  distribution and sales 
information technology plays a vital role in almost every aspect of the company s operations 
see business management information systems 
any problems with the company s information technology systems resulting from a year issue would strike at a time of the calendar year that is one of the company s busiest in terms of production and distribution 
while the company believes that it will be able to sustain normal operations even without any of its information technology systems  this could only continue for a short period of time 
the resources necessary to address any year issue which may arise will not be available entirely from internal personnel  and the company will be forced to contract with third party consultants 
at this time  the company does not have any such third party consultants under contract and does not anticipate that it will enter into any such contracts prior to the end of calendar further  the company does not anticipate that it will stockpile raw materials or inventory in advance of the end of calendar as a result  if the company does experience year issue related problems with its information technology systems  it may not be able to design new products  control  adjust or operate the computerized cutting systems  receive customer ordering information  monitor customer inventory and pos information  efficiently execute distribution functions  monitor and evaluate overall management information such as inventory  order flow and distribution  the company has communicated with all significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
as of the date of this report  substantially all of the company s significant suppliers and customers have informed the company that their systems are or will be year compliant within the next six to nine months 
if certain suppliers were not able to remediate their own year issues  it could affect the company s ability to order and receive raw materials shipments on a timely basis  which will have a direct and adverse impact on the company s production schedule 
this will then affect the company s ability to fill customer orders on a timely basis  the result of which may be a loss of customer sales 
in addition  if the company s customers do not remediate their systems  it could affect the company s ability to receive order information through edi and receive pos inventory information  both of which will also have a direct and adverse impact on the company s sales
