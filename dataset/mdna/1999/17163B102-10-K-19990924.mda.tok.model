with the exception of historical matters and statements of current status  certain matters discussed below are forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from targets or projected results 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  include  among others  year effects  growth through business combinations and internal expansion  the ability to attract and retain qualified consultants  dependence on significant relationships and the absence of long term contracts  management of a large and rapidly growing business  project risks  pricing and margin pressure  competition  potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results  price volatility  and international expansion  which are discussed herein under the caption factors that may affect future results 
many of these factors are beyond the company s ability to predict or control 
in addition  as a result of these and other factors  the company s past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance

ciber is a provider of information technology consulting services in the following areas strategic it management consulting e 
business solutions erp enterprise software solutions custom it solutions enterprise systems network integration enterprise outsourcing ciber has grown significantly through mergers and acquisitions  as well as through internal growth 
for purposes of this report  the term acquisition refers to business combinations accounted for as a purchase and the term merger refers to business combinations accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the company s acquisitions involve the capitalization of intangible assets  which intangible assets are generally amortized over periods of up to years for financial reporting purposes 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of an acquired business since the date of acquisition 
mergers result in a one time charge in the period in which the transaction is completed for costs associated with the business combination 
unless the effects are immaterial  the company s consolidated financial statements are restated for all periods prior to a merger to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the merged company 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses may vary as a percentage of revenues depending on the fluctuations in the selling  general and administrative expenses of merged companies  if any  during any given period 
ciber completed business combinations in each of the fiscal years ended june  and  and business combinations in the fiscal year ended june  the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenues and percentage change in the dollar amount of such items compared to the prior year dollar percentage of revenues increase decrease year ended june  year to year revenues gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income before amortization and merger costs amortization of intangible assets

of the increase in consulting revenues for fiscal in comparison to fiscal  approximately was due to revenues from acquired businesses or immaterial poolings of interests and approximately was due to organic growth of existing operations 
organic growth for the year was driven by a strong demand for erp implementation services and was lessened  to some extent  due to declining direct year service revenues 
gross margin percentage improved to of revenues in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement was due to improved gross margins on both consulting services and other revenues 
gross margins on consulting services have increased as a larger percentage of the company s revenues are derived from higher margin solutions oriented and project work 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for fiscal compared to of revenues for fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to greater economies of scale  including reduced administrative costs of certain merged companies 
as the company s focus continues to shift to more solutions oriented and project work  selling  general and administrative expenses will tend to increase as a percentage of sales and partially offset the generally higher gross margins on such work 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due to the additional amortization of intangible assets resulting from recent mergers and acquisitions 
fiscal acquisitions will increase amortization in future years to approximately million per year 
merger costs  primarily transaction related broker and professional costs  of million were incurred in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net interest and other income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased average cash balances available for investment and the elimination of borrowings of certain merged companies

the credit agreement requires a commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of the line of credit up to million

year compliance the following statements are year readiness disclosures in conformance with the year information and readiness disclosure act of the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer software and hardware and other devices with embedded technology that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of ciber s operations 
ciber has instituted various projects to address the year issue 
ciber believes its material internal information technology it systems  including payroll  billing and accounting systems  are currently year compliant 
for significant third party software applications  ciber has obtained confirmation that the software is year compliant 
ciber has completed testing and remediation  if necessary  of all internally developed software 
ciber is currently evaluating its non it systems  such as building security  elevators  fire safety systems  telephones  voice mail and other systems containing embedded microprocessors as well as evaluating the year readiness of its significant suppliers 
ciber relies on the services of the landlords of its offices  telecommunications companies  banks  utilities  commercial airlines  and insurance companies  among others 
as of june   ciber has received year compliance status information from all of its significant suppliers 
of these  have indicated that they are currently year compliant 
the remainder have indicated that they plan to be year compliant by december  if ciber does not obtain reasonable assurances from its significant third party vendors and suppliers that there will be no interruption of service as a result of the year issue  ciber intends to devise contingency plans 
there can be no assurance that any contingency plans developed by ciber will prevent such service interruption on the part of one or more of ciber s vendors from having a material adverse effect on ciber 
ciber s principal business is providing it services 
some of ciber s services are directly or indirectly related to the year issue  including year remediation services 
ciber provides services to clients that assist the client in their year projects 
in addition  ciber provides services to clients directly related to client systems that may or may not be year compliant 
due to the potential significance of the year issue upon client operations and upon any failure of critical client systems to which ciber has provided services  ciber may be subject to claims regardless of whether the failure is related to the services provided by ciber 
if asserted  the resolution of such claims  including defense costs  could have a material adverse effect on ciber 
ciber generally attempts to include provisions in client contracts that  among other things  disclaim implied warranties  limit the duration of any express warranties  limit ciber s maximum liability and disclaim any warranties for projects managed by the client 
there can be no assurance that ciber will be able to obtain these contractual protections in future client contracts  or that such provisions will protect ciber from  or limit the amount of  any liability arising from claims against ciber 
as a reseller of certain it products  ciber only passes to its customers the applicable vendors warranties 
ciber makes no warranties regarding year compliance of any of the products it resells 
ciber has developed and licensed certain warehousing and traffic software products that have subsequently been modified to be year compliant 
year compliant versions have been tested both internally and by a third party 
ciber is offering the year compliant software versions to its prior and existing customers at no charge 
ciber plans to contact all its customers and make available the year compliant software by september  as described above  ciber has identified various potential issues associated with the year issue 
ciber is devoting internal resources and is working with its suppliers to help ensure that ciber s business is not substantially interrupted as a result of the year ciber believes that the total amounts spent by it to date and that it expects to spend in fiscal addressing the year issue will be less than  ciber currently does not have a contingency plan in the event of a particular system not being year compliant 
such a plan will be developed if it becomes clear that ciber is not going to achieve its compliance objectives 
although ciber expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations  management believes that it is not possible to determine with certainty that all year problems affecting ciber  its vendors  or its clients have been identified or corrected 
if ciber is required to implement any contingency plan  it could have a material adverse effect on ciber s operations 
in addition  the business interruption  resulting from year issues  of any of ciber s significant clients could have a material adverse effect on ciber 
this discussion of ciber s year efforts  management s expectations relating to year compliance and the possible effects on ciber are forward looking statements 
seasonality the company experiences a moderate amount of seasonality 
typically  operating income as a percentage of revenues is lowest in the last quarter of each calendar year the company s second fiscal quarter because more holidays and vacations are taken at that time of year resulting in fewer hours billed in that period 
recent accounting pronouncements the company believes that recent accounting pronouncements will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has proposed a new statement that would  among other things  eliminate the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
the proposed statement would require all business combinations to be recorded using the purchase method of accounting and any resulting excess purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets goodwill would be charged to earnings over a period of not more than years 
the proposal would also allow the reporting of earnings per share excluding amortization of goodwill 
the proposed accounting would be effective for business combinations after the effective date 
the actual pronouncement  when issued  will likely have changes from the exposure draft 
if issued  management believes this pronouncement would increase the amount of goodwill recorded for subsequent business combinations as ciber has historically completed a large percentage of business combinations as poolings of interests and also increase the amortization charge against earnings 
as a result  management believes its internal operating metrics  excluding amortization of intangibles  should also be considered when evaluating the company s performance 
management also expects investors to place increasing emphasis on cash eps 
factors that may affect future results included in this report and elsewhere from time to time in other written reports and oral statements  including but not limited to  the annual report to shareholders  quarterly shareholder letters  news releases and investor presentations  are forward looking statements about the company s business strategies  market potential  future financial performance and other matters which reflect management s current expectations 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  those set forth below 
the company operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of its common stock 
year effects it services industry growth in and was driven to a great extent by year dynamics 
this growth was caused not only by increased demand for direct year services  such as code remediation  but also indirect services  such as erp systems implementation and replacement of non compliant legacy systems 
towards the end of fiscal  ciber s growth began to slow as companies completed year readiness programs and became reluctant  in many cases  to commence significant new initiatives until year failure risks have passed  generally during the first half of calendar management believes there will be significant increased future demand for it services driven by e 
business and other factors that will follow the year transition period  beginning sometime during the first half of calendar however  during this transition period  revenues and operating performance may decline 
given the lack of precedent for an issue of this nature and magnitude  ciber s ability to forecast the impact on future results is limited 
growth through business combinations and internal expansion as an integral part of its business strategy  the company intends to continue to expand by acquiring information technology businesses 
the company continuously evaluates potential business combinations and aggressively pursues attractive transactions 
from july  through june   the company completed business combinations 
the success of this strategy depends not only upon the company s ability to identify and acquire businesses on a cost effective basis  but also upon its ability to integrate acquired operations into its organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel and to retain clients of acquired businesses 
business combinations involve numerous risks  including the ability to manage geographically remote offices  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and the risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no direct experience 
in addition  acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and the incurrence of significant charges associated with the amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets or future write downs of the recorded values of assets acquired 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to combine additional business  or that any business combination will result in benefits to the company  or that management will be able to manage effectively the resulting business 
additionally  the company experiences competition for business combinations 
the company may open new offices in attractive markets with its own personnel 
many of the company s branch offices were originally start up operations 
not all branch offices  whether start up or acquired  have been successful 
the company s growth rate has been due  in part  to the growth of industry demand for information technology professional services 
there can be no assurance that this increased industry demand will continue in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully start up  identify  acquire  or integrate future successful branch office operations 
ability to attract and retain qualified consultants the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to hire and retain adequately trained personnel who can address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of its clients 
the company s on going personnel needs arise from i increased demand for the company s services  ii turnover  which is generally high in the industry and iii client requests for consultants trained in the newest software and hardware technologies 
few of the company s employees are bound by non compete agreements 
competition for personnel in the information technology services industry is significant and the company has had  and expects to continue to have  difficulty in attracting and retaining an optimal level of qualified consultants 
in particular  competition is intense for the limited number of qualified project managers and professionals with specialized skills  such as a working knowledge of certain sophisticated software 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to continue to grow 
dependence on significant relationships and the absence of long term contracts the company s five largest clients accounted for of the company s total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  no one client accounted for more than of the company s total revenues in fiscal ciber strives to develop long term relationships with its clients 
most client assignments are from three to twelve months  however  many of the company s client relationships have continued for many years 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contact at any time 
in addition  under many contracts  clients may reduce their use of the company s services under such contract without penalty 
the termination or significant reduction of its business relationship with any of its significant clients would have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  the company has a significant relationship with peoplesoft as a peoplesoft implementation partner 
in fiscal  the company derived approximately of its total revenues from clients who purchased implementation services for their peoplesoft software 
in the event peoplesoft products become obsolete or non competitive or if the company should lose its implementation partner status with peoplesoft  the company could suffer a material adverse effect 
management of a large and rapidly growing business the company s rapid growth could place a substantial strain on its operational  administrative and financial resources 
the company s ability to manage the growth of its staff and facilities effectively will require it to continue to improve its operational  financial and other internal systems  and to train  motivate and manage its consultants 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively or its consultants are unable to achieve anticipated performance levels  or if the integration of new businesses results in a material diversion of management s attention from the day to day operations of the business  the company s results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
project risks the company has provided and intends to continue to provide project services to its clients 
projects are distinguishable from the company s professional services staff supplementation contracts by the level of responsibility assumed by the company and the potentially longer and more costly sales cycle of a project 
these factors may cause fluctuations in quarterly results 
in a typical project  the company assumes major responsibilities for the management of the project and or the design of deliverables that results in a client specific outcome 
with professional services staff supplementation contracts  the company s clients generally maintain responsibility for the overall tasks 
the failure of a project or the failure of the company to provide project services in a satisfactory manner could have a material adverse effect on the company 
further  the company may undertake projects on a fixed price basis and also may guarantee performance based upon defined operating specifications 
cost overruns  unsatisfactory performance or unanticipated difficulties in completing projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
pricing and margin pressure many of the company s larger clients purchase information technology services primarily from a limited number of pre approved vendors 
in order to remain on its clients vendor lists and to develop new client relationships  the company must satisfy client requirements at competitive rates 
although the company continually attempts to lower its costs  there are other companies that may offer the same or similar services at equal or lower costs 
furthermore  if competition intensifies between information technology service providers  there may be increased demand for qualified consultants resulting in upward market pressure on consultant compensation 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively on pricing or other requirements and  as a result  the company could lose clients or be unable to maintain historic gross margin levels or to operate profitably 
with respect to the company s implementation services for software packages  the manufacturers of such software may have training or other requirements that inhibit the company from competing effectively with other packaged software implementation providers 
in addition  as the company expands its service offerings to include a greater number of fixed price projects  the company may experience a decrease in margins as a result of unanticipated cost overruns resulting from the inability to meet various project requirements 
competition the company operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing industry and competes with a variety of companies 
most of these competing companies  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial  technical and marketing resources  provide the same services as those offered by  and some offer a wider variety of services than  the company 
many large accounting and management consulting firms offer services that overlap with a significant portion of the company s services  and the company competes with the internal information technology staffs of its clients and potential clients 
also  computer hardware and software vendors are becoming increasingly involved in systems integration projects 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete successfully with its existing or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
factors that may affect the company s quarterly revenues or operating results generally include costs relating to the expansion of the company s business  the extent and timing of business acquisitions  the incurrence of merger costs  the timing of assignments from customers  the seasonal nature of the company s business due to variations in holidays and vacation schedules  the introduction of new services by the company or its competitors  price competition or price changes  general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the information technology  consulting  or information technology staffing industries 
quarterly sales and operating results can be difficult to forecast even in the short term 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that the company s revenues or operating results in one or more future quarters will fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts or investors 
in such event  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
price volatility the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the company s prospects  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and by economic  financial and other factors and market conditions that can affect the capital markets generally  the industry segment of which the company is a part  the nyse  including the level of  and fluctuations in  the trading prices of stocks generally and sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock in the market  or the perception that such sales could occur  and by other events that are difficult to predict and are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time in recent years that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
international expansion in future periods  ciber may significantly expand its international operations  which currently includes offices in toronto and vancouver  canada 
such international operations will be subject to political and economic uncertainties  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and new tax and legal requirements 
other risks inherent in managing international operations include geographically distant locations  customers and employees speaking different languages and different cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no activities in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
the company s exposure to market risks  ie interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  equity price risk through other financial instruments  including  among others  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  lines of credit  is not material
