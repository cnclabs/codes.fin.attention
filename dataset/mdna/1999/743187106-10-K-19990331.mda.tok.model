item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview progenics is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative products for the treatment and prevention of cancer and viral diseases 
the company commenced principal operations in late and since that time has been engaged primarily in organizational efforts  including recruitment of scientific and management personnel  research and development efforts  development of its manufacturing capabilities  establishment of corporate collaborations and raising capital 
in order to commercialize the principal products that the company has under development  the company will need to address a number of technological challenges and comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the amount of funds that will be required or the length of time that will pass before the company receives revenues from sales of any of its products 
to date  product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
the company expects that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 
the company s other sources of revenues through december  have been payments received under its collaboration agreements  research grants and contracts related to the company s cancer and hiv programs and interest income 
to date  a majority of the company s expenditures have been for research and development activities 
the company expects that its research and development expenses will increase significantly as its programs progress and the company makes filings for related regulatory approvals 
the company had recurring losses prior to and had at december  an accumulated deficit of  the company has financed its operations primarily through the private sale and issuance of equity securities  a line of credit that has since been repaid and terminated  payments received under its collaboration with bms beginning in july  payments received under its collaboration with roche beginning in january and the proceeds of the company s initial public offering in november the company will require additional funds to complete the development of its products  to fund the cost of clinical trials  and to fund operating losses which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company does not expect its products under development to be commercialized in the near future 
in july  progenics entered into a joint development and master license agreement the bms agreements 
these agreements provide for bms to fund further development  clinical trials and regulatory filings related to gmk and mgv 
consequently  progenics does not expect to make significant additional expenditures relating to these product candidates for so long as these agreements remain in force 
in connection with the establishment of this collaboration  bms paid to the company in july an aggregate of approximately million  representing reimbursement for expenses previously incurred by progenics in the development of gmk and mgv  licensing fees and reimbursement of clinical development costs for the period april  to september  in connection with payments made by bms to the company under the bms license agreement  the company made certain payments to licensors and incurred other related expenses

depreciation and amortization remained relatively unchanged from  in to  in in  the company recognized a provision for income taxes of  which was based upon prevailing federal and state tax rates reduced by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to the extent permitted by the alternative minimum tax rules 
the company s net loss in was  compared to net income of  in liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations since inception primarily through private placements of equity securities  loans that were subsequently converted into equity securities  a line of credit that was repaid and terminated  payments received under collaboration agreements including those with bms and roche  an initial public offering  funding under research grants and contracts  interest on investments and the sale of research reagents 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the company raised  and  in net proceeds from the sale of approximately  units and  units  respectively  in a private placement of shares of the company s series c preferred stock in a unit offering 
each unit series c unit consisted of four shares of series c preferred stock and one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of series c preferred stock for any time within five years of the date of issuance series c warrant

the company believes that its present capital resources should be sufficient to fund operations at least through the end of  based on the company s current operating plan 
no assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume the company s liquid assets before such time 
the company will require substantial funds to conduct development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials and other activities relating to the commercialization of any potential products 
in addition  the company s cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  potential relationships with in licensors and collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of the company s research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the company has no committed external sources of capital and  as discussed above  expects no significant product revenues for a number of years as it will take at least that much time to bring the company s products to the commercial marketing stage 
the company may seek additional financing  such as through future offerings of equity or debt securities or agreements with corporate partners and collaborators with respect to the development of the company s technology  to fund future operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
year compliance the year problem relates to many currently installed computers  software  and other equipment that relies on embedded technology collectively  business systems 
these business systems are not capable of distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than one year  business systems used by many companies  in a very wide variety of applications  will experience operating difficulties unless they are modified  upgraded  or replaced to adequately process information involving  related to or dependent upon the century change 
if a business system used by the company or a third party dealing with the company fails because of the inability of the business system to properly read a st century date  the results could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year business systems failures and has established a team to address year risk 
the team is reviewing the company s internal infrastructure and believes that it has identified substantially all of the major business systems used in connection with its internal operations 
the company has commenced the process of identifying and correcting the major business systems that may need to be modified  upgraded  or replaced  and expects to complete this process  along with remedial actions before the end of costs incurred to date to correct year problems have been immaterial 
the company estimates the total cost to complete any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of affected business systems will not have a material impact on the company s business or results of operations 
this estimate is being monitored and will be revised  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the company also recognizes the risk that suppliers of products  services  and collaborators with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis may not comply with year requirements 
the company has initiated formal communications with significant suppliers and collaborators to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable if these third parties fail to remediate their own year issues 
the review is ongoing and the company is unable to determine  at this time  the probability that any material supplier or collaborator will not be able to correct any year problem in a timely manner 
in the event any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services  or continue the collaborations with the company  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
based on the above  the company has yet to develop a comprehensive contingency plan with respect to the year problem 
the company will continue to monitor its own business systems and  to the extent possible  evaluate the business systems of its third party suppliers and collaborators to ensure progress on this critical matter 
however  if the company identifies significant risk related to the year compliance or progress deviates from anticipated timelines  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time
