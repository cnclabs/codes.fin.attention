highlights first quarter during the first quarter  in anticipation of pfizer s launch of viagra sildenafil  vivus increased the size of its sales force and expanded its physician call universe of urologists and ed specialists to include primary care physicians who prescribed treatments for ed 
in march  pfizer announced the approval of sildenafil in the us by the food and drug administration fda and proceeded to launch sildenafil through a multi million dollar direct to consumer advertising campaign  aided by intense media interest 
pfizer s campaign for sildenafil became the largest pharmaceutical launch to date in the history of the us pharmaceutical market 
outside the us  muse gained international regulatory approvals 
vivus marketing partner astra launched muse into the united kingdom in february 
in march  the european medicine controls agency mca approved vivus manufacturing facility for muse 
second quarter the ed marketplace in the us changed dramatically during the second quarter of primarily based on the media attention engendered by the launch of sildenafil  patients were requesting prescriptions for sildenafil from their primary care physician 
urologists  vivus most cultivated audience  ceased to serve as the leading prescribers of erectile dysfunction therapy 
this shift in the marketplace away from the urologist dramatically reduced the impact of vivus sales organization 
vivus muse had positive data presented in several forums during this period 
the june edition of the british journal of urology reported on a landmark european study in hospitals in the uk  france  germany  ireland and the netherlands where it was demonstrated that of men who used muse achieved an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse 
vivus also released long term safety data in excess of months with regard to muse related serious adverse effects 
serious adverse events in this long term study were found to be similar to treatment with placebo  muse did not increase the incidence of heart attack  stroke  hospitalization  disability or death 
also during the second quarter  muse was approved in south africa  the first janssen territory 
third quarter in july  vivus announced a strategic shift in its business model  vivus decided to seek a major pharmaceutical partner to promote muse in the us marketplace 
this change was necessary due to the erosion of market share muse suffered  and the very large expense associated with maintaining a competitively sized sales force for a primary care physician marketplace 
the company transferred its sales organization to alza corporation alza  and as part of the transfer  the alza urology sales representatives continued to detail muse to urologists through december  additionally  the company terminated its contract sales force agreement with innovex 
in august  the company announced that it had retained credit suisse first boston corporation to assist the company in evaluating various strategic alternatives including marketing collaborations or partnerships  acquisition of the company or other transactions 
in september  pfizer received approval in the european union for sildenafil 
based on the vivus us sales experience post launch of sildenafil  vivus distribution partners for muse notified the company that they would significantly reduce their orders for muse

the company recorded a significant write down of property  equipment and inventory 
the company significantly scaled back its manufacturing operations as a result of lower domestic and international demand for muse 
as a result  the company experienced an operating loss of million  or per share  in the third quarter of fourth quarter as a result of the restructuring effort vivus initiated in the third quarter among other things  the company reported net income of million  or per share 
all company expenses for the fourth quarter of were less than the preceding quarters of as well as the same period in the company anticipates that these steps have brought its cost structure in line with current revenue projections  however  there can be no assurance that product demand will not weaken further or that these steps will result in sustained profitability in the future 
vivus made significant progress during the fourth quarter in the area of international approvals 
muse was approved and launched in canada and it also received approval for licensing within the european union 
the company announced high efficacy rates for muse in the severely dysfunctional radical prostatectomy patient group 
vivus also reiterated its findings regarding the safety of muse in combination with renewed sexual activity in older americans 
in november  vivus was issued us patent number  for method and kit for preventing erectile dysfunction 
the patent describes and protects the use of muse  or other transurethral therapies  as a periodically administered treatment to prevent erectile dysfunction 
the patent is based on the concept that regular administration of an appropriate therapy transurethrally increases blood flow to the penis  thereby maintaining functional erectile tissue within the penis 
results of operations years ended december  and product revenues for year ended december  were million in the us and million internationally compared to million in the us and internationally for the same period in the significant decline in us product revenue is due to lower demand for the company s product muse which resulted from the us launch of sildenafil  a competitive oral treatment for erectile dysfunction 
underlying demand for muse domestically  as measured by retail prescriptions  has declined approximately since the commercial launch of sildenafil in april internationally  revenues increased to million in as the company s international marketing partners  janssen and astra  prepared to launch in various countries 
as sildenafil is offered in other countries  it is likely that a large number of current and future impotence patients will want to try this new oral therapy and international demand for muse will be negatively impacted 
as a result of this and approvals to market muse in europe occurring later than anticipated  the company s international marketing partners  janssen and astra  have significantly reduced orders for muse which will have a material effect on the company s business  financial conditions and results of operations
