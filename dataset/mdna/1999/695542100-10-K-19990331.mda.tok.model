introduction throughout this section the company makes reference to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  equity in loss of an unconsolidated subsidiary  restructuring charge  non recurring charges  and extraordinary loss adjusted ebitda 
ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization is a key performance measure used in the wireless messaging industry and is one of the financial measures by which the company s covenants are calculated under the agreements governing its debt obligations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures defined in generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

results of operations the following table presents certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues from services  rent and maintenance plus product sales less the cost of products sold net revenues for the years ended december    and year ended december  net revenues operating expenses services  rent and maintenance selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring charge non recurring charges operating income loss net loss ebitda adjusted ebitda net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of over million for the year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  increased from million for the year ended december  revenues from services  rent and maintenance  which the company considers its primary business  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  services  rent and maintenance revenues for the year ended december  increased from million for the year ended december  the increases from to were due to growth in the number of units in service with subscribers of the company 
the increases from to were primarily due to an increase in average revenue per unit resulting from pricing initiatives and the changing mix of the company s subscriber base toward higher revenue products and services 
in an effort to increase the overall profitability of its services  the company has increased its focus toward higher value products and services such as alphanumeric and nationwide paging 
in addition  in an effort to reduce the number of customers using unprofitable services  the company has instituted certain price initiatives  including setting appropriate minimum pricing levels for new business and selectively increasing prices to existing customers using certain services 
the company expects these initiatives  along with sales productivity increases associated with the company s restructuring which will allow field sales personnel to focus solely on sales  to result in incremental annual revenues in and beyond 
however  as a result of these actions  the company experienced a net decrease in units in service during the second half of  which trend the company expects to continue during the first half of also as a result of these actions  the company experienced its first year to year increase in average revenue per unit arpu 
the number of units in service with subscribers at december    and was   and  respectively 
the average revenue per unit for the company s core domestic operations increased to for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the corresponding periods of and the company is continuing to review its pricing structure for all of its services 
product sales decreased to million of net revenues for compared to million of net revenues for the decrease in product sales and corresponding decrease in cost of products sold from to resulted primarily from the company s efforts to reduce the number of customers using unprofitable services through certain pricing initiatives  which resulted in a substantial decrease in sales through the company s reseller channel 
services  rent  and maintenance expenses increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for the year ended december  services  rent  and maintenance expenses for the year ended december  increased by from million of net revenues for the year ended december  the increases in services  rent  and maintenance expenses and the increase as a percentage of net revenues from to were partially attributable to an increase in telephone expenses associated with the enactment of regulations requiring providers of payphones be compensated for all calls placed from payphones to toll free numbers 
this requirement increased the company s cost of providing toll free number service commencing in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the increases were increased contracted dispatch costs related to advanced messaging units placed in service during and expenses associated with an increase in transmitter sites 
the increase in services  rent  and maintenance expenses from to was the result of growth in the number of units in service with subscribers  expenses associated with an increase in transmitter sites  expansion of nationwide transmission networks  costs incurred by the company s canadian operations  and costs associated with the company s advanced messaging operations primarily voicenow service during 
selling expenses were relatively flat for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  selling expenses were million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for the year ended december  selling expenses for the year ended december  increased by from million of net revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues from to resulted primarily from a lower amount of sales commissions paid in conjunction with the net decline in units in service with subscribers during and an overall decrease in certain marketing research  development costs  and advertising expenses associated with the company s advanced messaging operations  due mainly to the decline in such costs related to its voicenow service  which was partially offset by an increase in such costs related to its new two way service 
the marketing research  development costs  and advertising expenses associated with the company s advanced messaging operations are expected to grow in future periods due to expanded promotion of its two way service 
the increase in selling expenses and the increase as a percentage of net revenues from to resulted primarily from certain marketing research  development costs  and advertising expenses associated with the company s advanced messaging operations primarily voicenow service during  and from the addition of sales personnel to support the growth from to in both net revenues and the number of units in service with subscribers 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by from million of net revenues for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses and the increase as a percentage of net revenues from to was primarily related to expenses associated with establishing the company s centers of excellence  redundant operating costs associated with operating both its new centers of excellence infrastructure and its traditional decentralized infrastructure  and increased levels of contract labor utilized during the transition to the centers of excellence infrastructure 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to occurred to support the growth in the number of units in service with subscribers 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from to was due to higher net revenues in depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million of net revenues for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased by from million of net revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from to resulted primarily from certain property and equipment becoming fully depreciated  certain non current assets becoming fully amortized  and the decline in capital expenditures by the company 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from to was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of subscriber devices owned by the company and leased to subscribers during  as compared to  the increase in computer and wireless messaging equipment used by the company in its operations  changes in subscriber device depreciation  and the commencement of spectrum license amortization 
effective january   the company shortened the depreciable life of its subscriber devices from four to three years  and revised the related residual values  in order to better reflect the estimated periods during which the subscriber devices remain in service 
the change in depreciable lives and residual values and the commencement of spectrum license amortization and certain other costs associated with the introduction of the company s voicenow service increased net loss by approximately million for the year ended december  the company expects to commence depreciation and amortization on the majority of the assets related to its centers of excellence during the first quarter of and its advanced messaging operations during the second and third quarters of  which in total is expected to increase depreciation and amortization expense in by approximately million to million 
in  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position reporting on the cost of start up activities sop  which requires the expensing of all start up costs as incurred as well as writing off the remaining unamortized balance of capitalized start up costs as of the date of the adoption of sop the company adopted the provisions of sop as of january   and recorded a charge of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write off all unamortized start up costs as of january  the company estimates that the impact of adopting sop will be an increase in services  rent  and maintenance and general and administrative expenses of approximately million for the year ended december   for costs that will be expensed in that otherwise would have been capitalized prior to the adoption of sop  and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million for the year ending december  see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of million during the quarter ended march   as a result of a restructuring approved by the company s board of directors on february  as part of the restructuring  the company is reorganizing its operations to expand its sales organization and eliminate redundant administrative operations by consolidating certain key support functions into centers of excellence 
the company expects to eliminate approximately  positions  net of positions added  through the consolidation of redundant administrative operations and key support functions located in offices throughout the country 
the company launched the centers of excellence in the fourth quarter of on a pilot basis  and expects to consolidate all of its existing support functions into these centers of excellence during although the company is currently experiencing duplicative costs associated with establishing the centers of excellence while maintaining its traditional decentralized infrastructure that negatively affected its operating results in the fourth quarter of and are expected to continue to do so through the first half of  the company expects to realize annual recurring performance improvements and cost savings of million to million after the restructuring is completed 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the non recurring charge of million in represents a write down of certain subscriber devices to their net realizable value 
the non recurring charge of million in represents a provision to write off in excess of  subscriber devices leased by the company to customers under an agreement with a national marketing affiliate 
during  the company experienced significant cancellations by the customer base developed through this affiliate and  as a result  did not expect to recover such subscriber devices from the former customers of this marketing affiliate 
as a result of the above factors  adjusted ebitda increased to million of net revenues for  compared to million of net revenues for adjusted ebitda for increased by from million of net revenues for adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenues for were negatively impacted by the company s advanced messaging operations  the formation of its centers of excellence  and its international operations 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenues for were negatively impacted by the introduction of the company s voicenow service and its international operations 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenues for were negatively impacted by the company s international operations 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  was million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest capitalized  a decrease in interest rates on outstanding borrowings under the company s billion domestic credit agreement the credit agreement  and the redemption of the company s million senior subordinated notes notes on may   which the company redeemed utilizing funds with lower interest rates borrowed under the company s credit agreement 
the company recorded an extraordinary loss of million in the second quarter of on the early retirement of the notes 
the extraordinary loss was comprised of the redemption premium of million and the write off of unamortized issuance costs of million 
the increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to the higher average level of indebtedness outstanding during the average level of indebtedness outstanding during was billion  compared to billion outstanding during liquidity and capital resources the company s operations and expansion into new markets and product lines required substantial capital investment for the development and installation of wireless communications systems and for the procurement of subscriber devices and related equipment 
furthermore  the company is currently in the process of building an advanced messaging network over which it can deploy new enhanced messaging services and customized wireless information 
capital expenditures excluding payments for spectrum licenses were million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december    and capital expenditures related to the company s core domestic operations were million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december    and the decrease in core domestic capital expenditures in was primarily due to a reduction in the company s network related expenditures pertaining to geographic coverage and capacity expansion 
the company believes it offers competitive geographic coverage and further expansion will be undertaken only as the company deems appropriate 
also  during  the company began instituting programs to utilize subscriber devices more effectively and to more closely control subscriber device capital expenditures  including efficiencies established in the logistics management of the subscriber device ordering process 
in addition to the programs to utilize subscriber devices more effectively  the decrease in core domestic capital expenditures in was also attributable to increased efficiencies in infrastructure deployment 
two other major areas of capital expenditures in were the centers of excellence and the advanced messaging network 
capital expenditures related to establishing the company s centers of excellence  including new systems implementations  were million for the year ended december  capital expenditures related to the company s buildout of its advanced messaging network were million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december    and the amount of capital expenditures may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and on an annual basis due to several factors  including the variability of units in service with subscribers 
based on current expectations  the company anticipates the total amount of capital expenditures to slightly decrease in as compared to  as it substantially completes capital expenditures made in connection with the company s expansion of its advanced messaging network and the establishment of its centers of excellence 
with the substantial completion of these capital expenditures in  the company expects aggregate capital expenditures in to decrease as compared to during  capital expenditures were funded primarily by net cash provided by operating activities of million  as well as incremental borrowings 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the increase resulted primarily from a decrease in net loss before restructuring charge of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  and a decrease in inventories of million 
the increase in accounts payable during resulted from the timing of invoices at year end related to additional capital expenditures incurred in the fourth quarter of and additional expenses in the fourth quarter of related to the centers of excellence 
as of december   the company had million of borrowings under its credit agreement 
as of march   this amount had increased to million 
under the credit agreement  the company is able to borrow  provided it meets certain financial covenants  the lesser of billion or an amount based primarily upon the company s domestic ebitda for the most recent fiscal quarter 
as of december   million was available for additional borrowings as of that date based on the company s domestic ebitda for the fourth quarter of the availability of additional borrowings in periods subsequent to december  is based upon the company s domestic ebitda for such future periods 
the company anticipates that  similar to the fourth quarter of  domestic ebitda will be negatively impacted during the first half of by i 
expenses associated with establishing the company s centers of excellence infrastructure while at the same time maintaining its traditional decentralized infrastructure  and ii 
expenses related to the completion of the company s advanced messaging network 
however  the company currently anticipates that it will have sufficient capital resources to complete the centers of excellence infrastructure and advanced messaging network and to make other planned capital expenditures 
the two credit agreements of the company s canadian subsidiaries provide for total borrowings of approximately million 
as of december   approximately million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities 
additional borrowings are available under these facilities  provided such borrowings are either collateralized or certain financial covenants are met 
as of december   the company s canadian subsidiaries are in compliance with all financial covenants of their separate credit agreements  however  the company has entered into negotiations with its lenders to modify certain covenants that the company believes may not be satisfied during the second and third quarters of although the company anticipates that these negotiations will be successful and will not result in a material change in borrowing capacity or interest expense  no assurance can be made that such result will be attained 
the deficiency in free cash flow  defined as adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures excluding payments for spectrum licenses and debt service  for the company s consolidated operations for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
free cash flow is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the improvements in free cash flow in and were primarily the result of decreases in capital expenditures and increases in adjusted ebitda in the company s core domestic operations  as previously noted 
payments for spectrum licenses totaled million for  million for  and million for inflation is not a material factor affecting the company s business 
system equipment and transmission costs have generally not increased and subscriber device costs have declined significantly over time 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  and occupancy costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
year readiness disclosure year issues affect virtually all companies and organizations throughout the world 
many existing computer programs were designed and developed to use and store only two digits to identify a calendar year  without considering the capability of properly recognizing the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected by january   the company could potentially experience system failures or interruptions  such as a temporary inability to deliver paging transmissions  system generation of erroneous data  or other disruptions of normal business operations 
the company has implemented a task force and developed a comprehensive plan to address year issues  and is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  renovate  and test its systems 
the company has developed an approach to address year issues that includes phases for inventory of business processes and systems  assessment of year risk  remediation  testing  implementation and evaluation 
the company has completed the inventory and assessment phases for all business processes 
the remediation and testing phases are ongoing 
the company is in the process of testing its software application systems and its embedded systems  such as its paging terminals and paging network 
to date  a number of the company s systems have either been fully tested or partially tested  while other systems are scheduled to be tested 
many applications are currently year compliant  and those that are not have been earmarked for retirement  replacement  or remediation 
in connection with the restructuring  the company is currently in the process of replacing all of its core systems for its new centers of excellence 
the company has completed year readiness assessment and testing on these systems 
all of the company s critical messaging and business applications are expected to be retired  replaced or remediated by mid year implementations of replacement systems or remediated systems have been completed for several critical systems  while others are in process or scheduled to be performed 
all implementations related to year issues are scheduled to be completed by mid year the evaluation phase for the year project will be conducted in the latter half of  and will consist of business process reviews to ensure all year issues have been addressed 
the company anticipates its total cost associated with correcting year problems  including the expenses necessary to remediate the company s existing systems and costs related to the collection of third party year readiness information  to be million to million  of which approximately million has been incurred as of december  in addition  in connection with the restructuring  the company is currently in the process of replacing all of its core systems for its new centers of excellence at an estimated cost of approximately million to million 
the company is working with motorola  inc  glenayre technologies  inc  and other primary vendors that currently supply the company with subscriber devices  wireless messaging terminals  and network facilities  to assess their year readiness 
the company s primary vendors are making the preparations necessary for their products and services to be ready for the year however  there can be no assurance that third parties  on which the company s business relies  will successfully remediate their systems on a timely basis 
the company also relies on the provision of electrical power and telecommunications transmission services in the operation of its business 
the company has queried all of its primary electrical and telecommunications suppliers regarding year compliance 
each supplier queried believes that it will be year compliant by the end of the company has no means of confirming these statements  nor any ability to ensure year compliance by these suppliers 
the company believes that although it may experience power and or transmission outages related to year noncompliance  these outages will be limited in both scope and duration and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate nor on its results of operations 
in addition  the possibility of power and or transmission outages is being addressed in the contingency planning process described below 
the company is working with a globally recognized consulting firm to develop contingency plans to mitigate the impact of its potential system failures related to year issues 
the contingency plans will address the risk of potential failures related to internal software applications  embedded systems  infrastructure  and third party systems including electrical power and telecommunications transmission services 
the contingency plans are expected to be completed by mid year the cost of the company s year project and the timetable on which the company believes it will complete this project are based on management s best estimates and include assumptions regarding third party modification plans 
however  in particular due to the potential impact of third party modification plans  there can be no assurance that these estimates and this timetable will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the company s business  financial position  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its computer systems and applications  or those operated by third parties  to properly operate or manage dates beyond in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of any potential liability or lost revenue cannot be estimated at this time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on the company s variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of its total long term obligations as of december  if interest rates average one percent more in than they did during  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the company s variable rate long term obligations as of december  market risk for fixed rate long term obligations is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the preceding sensitivity analyses do not  however  consider the effects that such changes in interest rates may have on overall economic activity  nor does it consider additional actions the company may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ from the above analyses 
the company s earnings are also affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar and spanish peseta 
in addition  the company is subject to market risk related to its net investments in its canadian and spanish subsidiaries 
however  the impact of such market risk exposures as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been  and is not expected to be  material based on the relative insignificance of the company s canadian and spanish subsidiaries to the company s financial position or results of operations 
as of december   the company was not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or market commodity prices
