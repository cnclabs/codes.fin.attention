the company s fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest june fiscal years   and ended june  june  and june  respectively  and consisted of weeks 
references to   and shall be to the respective fiscal year unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires 
overview verilink corporation the company develops  manufactures and markets integrated access products and customer premise equipment for telecommunications network service providers nsps and corporate end users on wide area networks 
verilink s integrated network access products are used by network service providers such as interexchange and local exchange carriers  and providers of internet  personal communications and cellular services to provide seamless connectivity and interconnect for multiple traffic types on wide area networks wans 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired txport  a manufacturer of high speed voice  and data communications products  based in huntsville  alabama for  in cash  which was funded by the company s working capital 
accordingly  the results of operations of txport  commencing november   the date of acquisition  have been included with the company s results for fiscal in july  the company announced its plans to substantially consolidate its operations into its existing operations located in huntsville  alabama 
the goal of this plan is to reduce expenses and enable the company to achieve profitability at lower revenue levels 
in connection with those plans the company will also outsource its san jose based manufacturing operations to a third party subcontract manufacturer 
during  verilink s access system product line continued to generate the majority of sales 
verilink designed the access system with modular hardware and software to enable its customers to access increased network capacity and to adopt new communications services in a cost effective manner 
the access system provides integrated access to low speed services  fractional t e services  and t  e  t  and frame relay services 
the access system was introduced in as an extension of the successful as platform and includes an increase in switching capacity  support for voice signals and broadband multiplexing up to t rates 
the company has other features under development that are intended to expand the number of services the access system products support 
the company also sells single purpose network access devices for selected applications 
the acquisition of the former txport product line significantly adds to the breadth of the company s product portfolio in this area  and contributed a significant percentage of the company s total sales in the second half of fiscal the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the company s results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
results of operations sales thousands net sales    percentage change from preceding year net sales for increased to million from net sales of million 
the increase was solely attributable to the sales contribution of products acquired from the txport acquisition that was completed in november sales from these products represented approximately of total year sales  and of the second half of the year sales 
net sales for were million representing a decrease of from sales of million 
the decline in net sales during was attributable primarily to a decline in shipments to the company s reseller and carrier customers that was partially off set by improved shipments to system integrators 
the company believes net sales were adversely affected in part by pending merger and consolidation discussions among the company s key customers resulting in delayed purchases 
during  shipments of the access system product line accounted for approximately of net sales compared to during and in the sales contribution of the recently introduced as was negligible as a result of its late introduction and as selling and customer testing cycles extended beyond what had been anticipated 
the company s business is characterized by the concentration of sales to a limited number of key customers 
sales to the company s top five customers accounted for  and of sales in   and  respectively 
the company s largest customers in fiscal were mciworldcom  nortel  bell atlantic nynex  timeplex and ericsson formerly qualcomm 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and factors affecting future results customer concentration 
the company sells its products primarily in the united states through a direct sales force and through a variety of resellers  including original equipment manufacturers oems  system integrators  value added resellers vars and distributors 
sales to vars and distributors accounted for approximately of sales in  as compared to approximately in and in with the addition of the former txport product line the importance of the channel is expected to increase  as those products lend themselves more to an indirect distribution model 
to date  sales outside of north america have not been significant 
however  the company intends to expand the marketing of its products to markets outside of north america 
gross profit thousands gross profit    percentage of sales gross profit  as a percentage of sales in was as compared to in and in the decrease in gross profit margin in was primarily due to significantly lower sales volume for the company s san jose based operations  particularly in the second half of the year  in combination with the relatively fixed cost of maintaining manufacturing operations in both california and alabama 
this lower sales volume was accompanied by a reduction in unit volumes of normally high unit volume products  and resulted in inefficiencies associated with producing a high mix of products at lower volumes 
the decrease in gross profit margin in was primarily due to increased manufacturing overhead spending resulting from higher labor and facility related costs at lower net sales levels 
the increase in manufacturing overhead spending was offset in part by favorable direct material costs 
in future periods  the company s gross profit will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the cost of products manufactured at subcontract facilities  the channels of distribution  the price of products sold  discounting practices  the mix of products sold  price competition  increases in material costs  and changes in other components of cost of sales 
as the company introduces new products  it is possible that such products may have lower gross profit than other established products in high volume production 
accordingly  gross profit as a percentage of sales may vary 
research and development thousands research and development    percentage of sales research and development expenses r d increased to million or of sales in compared to million and million or and of sales for and  respectively 
the expense increase during is due principally to the addition of expenses associated with the huntsville development organization beginning in november  and to an increased rate of development on the as product line during the first half of the fiscal year 
although r d expenses increased in absolute dollars  it decreased as a percentage of sales due to higher sales volume in as compared to the expense increase in was due principally to the use of outside consultants and the addition of personnel associated with product development activities 
the increase in r d expenses in as a percentage of sales was due to an increase in spending at reduced sales levels 
during  the company s new product development efforts focused on advanced features for the access system platform  the access system and development of the node manager developed to provide node element management capabilities for all access system and modules 
the company considers product development expenditures to be critical to future sales and expects to continue to invest in this area  while such expenditures as a percentage of sales may vary 
there can be no assurance that the company s research and development efforts will result in commercially successful new technology and products in the future  and those efforts may be affected by other factors as noted below 
see factors affecting future results dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
selling  general and administrative thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of sales the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in sg a expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in due to the decline in revenues in the san jose operations combined with the overlap in sg a functions in the company s california and alabama operations 
the increase in expense in was primarily the result of the addition of expenses from the txport acquisition 
selling expenses increased as a result of increased selling efforts and equipment demonstration costs 
marketing expenses increased principally as a result of incremental costs associated with the integration of sales collateral of txport into a single company  more extensive trade show participation  and increases in other promotional activities such as direct mail campaigns 
general and administrative expenses also increased as a result of increases in staff associated with the acquisition of txport and outside contract costs associated with the implementation of the company s erp system 
the increase in dollars spent in was due to the increase in selling and marketing activities and personnel related costs necessary to support the company s infrastructure 
these expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in due to increased dollar spending between periods at reduced net sales levels 
the company expects that general and administrative expenses will decline as a result of its plans to consolidate its operations in huntsville  alabama 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to reduce expenses 
see factors affecting future results restructuring actions may not achieve intended results 
acquired in process research and development effective november   the company completed its acquisition of txport  inc txport from acme cleveland corporation  by purchasing all the outstanding shares of txport at a cost of  txport is a manufacturer of high speed voice and data communications products 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method  and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired  including core technology  and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair market values at the date of acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition the company was involved in research and development projects in relation to three areas  enhancement and augmentation of the csu product line  enhancement and augmentation of the csu dsu product line and development of packet and frame aware csu dsu products along with a virtual private network product 
the in process research and development of million  which was expensed at the acquisition date  represented the estimated current fair market value of the research and development projects which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses at the date of acquisition 
the value of in process research and development was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on management estimates of revenues  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from the project 
the research and development costs included in the model reflect costs to sustain the project  but exclude costs to bring the in process project to technological feasibility 
the estimated revenues were based on management projections for the projects 
projected gross margins reflect recent historical performance of other company products and are in line with industry expectations 
the estimated selling  general and administrative costs  and research and development costs were estimated excluding synergies expected from the acquisition 
the discount rate used in discounting the net cash flows from in process research and development is 
this discount rate reflects the uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances that could potentially impact the estimates described above 
the percent of completion for the three project areas was determined by comparing both effort expected and research and development costs incurred as of november  to the remaining effort to be expended and research and development costs to be incurred  based on management s estimates  to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
based on these comparison management estimated the three project areas to be approximately   and complete as of the date of acquisition 
the projects were substantially completed by june the effort and costs required to complete the projects approximated the estimates made by management at the date of acquisition 
recent actions and comments from the securities and exchange commission have indicated that they are reviewing the current valuation methodology of purchased in process research and development relating to acquisitions 
the commission is concerned that some companies are writing off more of the value of an acquisition than is appropriate 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist 
however  there can be no assurance that the commission will not seek to reduce the amount of purchased in process research and development previously expensed by the company 
this would result in the restatement of previously filed financial statements of the company and could have a material negative impact on the financial results for the period subsequent to the acquisition 
the results of the operations acquired have been included with those of the company from the date of acquisition 
intangible assets have been recorded and are being amortized over estimated useful lives between three and ten years 
restructuring charge in march  the company announced and implemented a restructuring of the business to streamline operations and eliminate redundant functions by consolidating manufacturing operations  combining sales and marketing functions  and restructuring research and development activities 
included as a part of the restructuring activities was the retirement of the company s two founders 
the company incurred a pretax restructuring charge of  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of the restructuring charge 
approximately  of the restructuring charge was cash in nature and paid out of the company s working capital 
in connection with the company s plans to substantially consolidate its operations into its existing operations located in huntsville  alabama  and outsource its san jose manufacturing operations  the company expects that approximately positions located in san jose will be either eliminated or displaced to huntsville  alabama 
in addition  the company expects to incur a charge in the first quarter of fiscal related to the early termination of its lease obligations  the separation of employees  and the write down of impaired assets 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net declined to million from million in as a result of substantially lower invested cash balances 
interest and other income  net remained relatively unchanged between and at approximately provision for benefit from income taxes in fiscal  the company recorded no benefit from income taxes due to continued operating losses and the uncertainty of realization of the company s net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  the company recorded a benefit from income taxes of  representing an effective tax rate of  compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal this benefit was based on available net operating loss carryback capacity 
as of june   the company had fully utilized its available carryback capacity 
liquidity and capital resources at june  the company s principal sources of liquidity included million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
during  the company used million of net cash in operating activities  a million change from the million of net cash provided by operating activities in during the company generated million in net cash from operating activities 
accounts receivable increased million to million at june  from million at june  this was due to the acquisition of txport inc  less linearity in shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in and a million advance billing made to a customer at its request 
accounts receivable at june  decreased by million as compared to june  reflecting an improvement in the linearity of shipments during the fourth quarter of over the prior year 
inventories increased million to million at june  from million at june  this increase was due to the acquisition of txport inc and lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of than expected 
in  total current liabilities increased by million due mainly to the liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of txport  inc in  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  reflecting increased procurement activities and accruals for outside consultants and service providers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to a use of million and million in  and respectively 
the net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the maturity of in short term investments offset by million in cash used for the acquisition of txport  inc  million of capital equipment and million of notes receivable from a director 
the net cash used in investing activities in and was primarily the result of greater purchases of short term investments  and purchases of property and equipment 
the company estimates that total budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal will approximate million and will include expenditures for it infrastructure  and design tools 
net cash used in financing activities was  in as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in and million in the use of cash in was primarily attributable to the company s repurchase of  of its common stock offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
on february   the board of directors authorized the company s management to systematically repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
as of june   the company had purchased  shares at a cost of  the company believes that its cash and investment balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance current operations  anticipated investments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company continues to investigate the possibility of generating financial resources through committed credit agreements  technology or manufacturing partnerships  equipment financing  and offerings of debt and equity securities 
year readiness the year presents concerns  which are widespread and complex 
if computer  information or telecommunication systems do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has evaluated and continues to evaluate its year risk as it exists in four areas information technology infrastructure  including reviewing what actions are necessary to bring all software tools used internally to year compliance  information systems used by the company s suppliers  potential warranty and year claims from the company s customers  and the potential impact of reduced spending by customers or potential customers on telecommunication network solutions as a result of devoting a substantial portion of their information system spending to resolve year compliance issues 
the company evaluated its information technology infrastructure for year compliance  which included reviewing what actions were required to make all software systems used internally year compliant 
the company purchased and implemented an enterprise resource planning solution erp which has been determined to be year compliant 
it is the company s intent for all software systems and tools that are identified as non compliant to be either upgraded or replaced 
for the non compliant systems identified to date  the cost to bring the systems to year compliance is not expected to be material to the company s operating results 
however  if implementation of replacement systems and tools is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations  business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company contacted its key suppliers to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
responses have generally indicated substantial remediation  or documented plans to remediate the year issue 
some have given written certification of internal and product compliance 
substantially all key suppliers have indicated compliance of their product or service 
in the event that any of the company s key suppliers does not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
all of the company s products were reviewed for compliance to year guidelines 
this process included a complete and thorough testing of current products as well as inclusion of year requirements in specifications for future product releases 
based on this review  the company believes its current product shipments are year compliant and that neither performance nor functionality are affected by dates prior to  during  and after the year and that the year is recognized as a leap year 
however  as all customer events cannot be anticipated  the company may see an increase in product warranty and other claims 
in the event that any of the company s products ultimately are not year compliant  or there are customer claims made against the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
costs 
the total cost to address the year issue has not been and is not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
the company is using both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test its software for year modifications 
the company does not separately track internal costs incurred on the year project  which principally includes payroll and related costs for information management employees that are being expensed as incurred 
these costs will be funded through operating cash flows 
risks 
the company believes  based on currently available information  that it will be able to properly manage its total year exposure 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in its efforts  or that the computer systems of other companies on which the company relies will be able to be modified in a timely manner 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a failure to modify such systems by another company  or modifications that are incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
contingency plans 
the company has formulated contingency plans in those areas where year non compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  the company has not developed a contingency plan to address every potential year non compliance situation that may be present when the year changes to effects of recent accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop no 
requires entities to capitalize costs related to internal use software once specified criteria have been met 
the company will adopt sop no 
for fiscal year in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for fiscal year however  since the company currently does not hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows

restructuring actions may not achieve intended results 
the company announced in july its plans to substantially consolidate its operations in huntsville  alabama in order to strengthen its business and improve its results from operations 
these actions are intended to streamline the company s operations  reduce operating costs  and enable the company to achieve profitability at lower revenue levels 
delay or difficulty in implementing these actions  or market factors could reduce the anticipated benefit of these actions 
the company s revenues  operating results  and financial condition  could be adversely affected by the company s ability to manage effectively the transition to huntsville  to continually improve new product development processes  and to outsource a substantial portion of its manufacturing activities 
in particular  there is a risk that the company may be unable to efficiently manage its operations due to the high likelihood of departures of members of its senior management team and the inherent complexities included in managing operations in both alabama and california 
moreover  the company s plans to outsource a substantial portion of its manufacturing activities exposes it to a number of risks including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery schedules  quality control and costs 
the failure by the company to overcome these risks and achieve the intended results from its restructuring actions would have a significant adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations  particularly in light of the company s recent disappointing operating results 
customer concentration 
a small number of customers continue to account for a majority of the company s sales 
in september  mci and worldcom completed their merger and now operate under the same name mciworldcom 
percentages of total revenue have been restated for fiscal and prior years as if the merger had been in effect for all periods presented 
similarly  in may   ericsson completed its acquisition of qualcomm s terrestrial code division multiple access cdma wireless infrastructure business 
percentages of total revenue for ericsson have been restated for fiscal and prior years as if the acquisition had been in effect for all periods presented 
in fiscal  sales to mciworldcom  nortel  and ericsson accounted for   and of the company s sales respectively and sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
in fiscal  sales to mciworldcom  nortel  and ericsson accounted for   and of the company s sales  respectively  and sales to the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
in fiscal  mciworldcom  nortel and ericsson accounted for   and of the company s sales  respectively  and the company s top five customers accounted for of the company s sales 
other than mciworldcom  nortel  and ericsson  no customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in fiscal years   or there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods  or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
certain customers of the company have been or may be acquired by other existing customers 
the impact of such acquisitions on sales to such customers is uncertain  but there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will not result in a reduction in sales to those customers 
in addition  such acquisitions could have in the past and could in the future  result in further concentration of the company s customers 
the company has in the past experienced significant declines in sales it believes were in part related to orders being delayed or cancelled as a result of pending acquisitions relating to its customers 
there can be no assurance future merger and acquisition activity among the customers will not have a similar adverse affect on the company s sales and results of operations 
the company s customers are typically not contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period 
product sales to major customers have varied widely from period to period 
in some cases  major customers have abruptly terminated purchases of the company s products 
loss of  or a material reduction in orders by  one or more of the company s major customers would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see competition and fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
dependence on contract manufacturers 
the company entered into arrangements with a single contract manufacturer to outsource substantially all of the company s san jose based manufacturing operations  including its procurement  assembly  and system integration operations 
during  a majority of the company s revenues were generated by products manufactured by its operations located in california 
there can be no assurance that this contract manufacturer will be able to meet the company s future requirements for manufactured products  or that such independent contractor will not experience quality problems in manufacturing the company s products 
the inability of the company s contract manufacturer to provide the company with adequate supplies of high quality products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the loss of any of the company s contract manufacturers could cause a delay in the company s ability to fulfill orders while the company identifies a replacement manufacturer 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a large extent on the continued contributions of its executive officers and key management  sales and technical personnel 
the company is a party to agreements with certain of its executive officers to help ensure the officer s continual service to the company in the event of a change in control 
each of the company s executive officers  and key management  sales and technical personnel would be difficult to replace 
as a result of the company s plans to consolidate its operations in huntsville  alabama  the company believes that it is highly likely that all of its officers  with the exception of graham pattison  president and ceo  and steve turner  vice president of the huntsville business unit  will not continue employment with the company after the transition  although to date  none has provided notice of termination and therefore  these positions will need to be replaced with either existing personnel from huntsville or with new managers 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key personnel  or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management of growth 
management of growth 
the company has recently experienced growth in the scope of its operations as a result of its recent acquisition 
to manage potential future growth effectively  the company must improve its operational  financial and management information systems and must hire  train  motivate and manage its employees 
the future success of the company also will depend on its ability to increase its customer support capability and to attract and retain qualified technical  marketing and management personnel  for whom competition is intense 
in particular  the current availability of qualified personnel is quite limited  and competition among companies for such personnel is intense 
the company is currently attempting to hire a number of executive management  product marketing and engineering personnel and has experienced delays in filling such positions and expects to experience continued difficulty in filling its needs for qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively achieve or manage any such growth  and failure to do so could delay product development and introduction cycles or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see dependence on key personnel 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
under the outsourcing plan  the company will generally rely upon a contract manufacturer to buy component parts that are incorporated into board assemblies used in its products 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
currently  the company depends upon and in the future  third party sub contractors will depend upon suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company has historically obtained several components and licenses certain embedded software from single or limited sources 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company and third party sub contractors requirements for any such components 
the company and third party sub contractors generally do not have any long term contracts with such suppliers  other than software vendors 
any significant interruption in the supply of  or degradation in the quality of  any such item could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
any loss in a key supplier  increase in required lead times  increase in prices of component parts  interruption in the supply of any of these components  or the inability of the company or its third party sub contractor to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
purchase orders from the company s customers frequently require delivery quickly after placement of the order 
as the company does not maintain significant component inventories  delay in shipment by a supplier could lead to lost sales 
the company uses internal forecasts to determine its general materials and components requirements 
lead times for materials and components may vary significantly  and depend on factors such as specific supplier performance  contract terms and general market demand for components 
if orders vary from forecasts  the company may experience excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  and suppliers may demand longer lead times  higher prices  or termination of contracts 
from time to time  the company has experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in fulfillment of customer orders 
such shortages and allocations may occur in the future  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s sales are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors resulting in more variability and less predictability in the company s quarter to quarter sales and operating results 
for example  sales to mciworldcom  nortel  and ericsson have varied between quarters by as much as million and delayed orders by these customers substantially negatively impacted the company s third and fourth quarter results in most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times 
the company s ability to affect and judge the timing of individual customer orders is limited 
the company has experienced large fluctuations in sales from quarter to quarter due to a wide variety of factors  such as delay  cancellation or acceleration of customer projects  and other factors discussed below 
the company s sales for a given quarter may depend to a significant degree upon planned product shipments to a single customer  often related to specific equipment deployment projects 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
delays or lost sales can be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by the third party subcontractors the company is using to outsource its manufacturing operations as well as by other vendors of components used in a customer s system  changes in implementation priorities  slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that the company s products support and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new services and products 
delays and lost sales have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
operating results in recent periods have been adversely affected by delays in receipt of significant purchase orders from customers 
the company believes that recent period sales have been adversely impacted by merger activities at some of its top customers 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays as a result of the need to modify its products to comply with unique customer specifications 
these and similar delays or lost sales could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see customer concentration and dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
the company s backlog at the beginning of each quarter typically is not sufficient to achieve expected sales for that quarter 
to achieve its sales objectives  the company is dependent upon obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter 
furthermore  the company s agreements with its customers typically provide that they may change delivery schedules and cancel orders within specified timeframes  typically up to days prior to the scheduled shipment date  without significant penalty 
the company s customers have in the past built  and may in the future build  significant inventory in order to facilitate more rapid deployment of anticipated major projects or for other reasons 
decisions by such customers to reduce their inventory levels could lead to reductions in purchases from the company 
these reductions  in turn  could cause fluctuations in the company s operating results and could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the periods in which the inventory is reduced 
the company s industry is characterized by declining prices of existing products  and therefore continual improvement of manufacturing efficiencies and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products are required to maintain gross margins 
in response to customer demands or competitive pressures  or to pursue new product or market opportunities  the company may take certain pricing or marketing actions  such as price reductions  volume discounts  or provision of services at below market rates 
these actions could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company  its major customers or its competitors  delays in new product introductions by the company  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in the product or customer mix of sales  changes in the level of operating expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  and general economic conditions 
all of the above factors are difficult for the company to forecast  and these or other factors can materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations regarding future sales and are fixed in the short term to a large extent 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in sales 
any significant decline in demand relative to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company has had  and in some future quarter may have operating results below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
see potential volatility of stock price 
the company s products are covered by warranties and the company is subject to contractual commitments concerning its products 
if unexpected circumstances arise such that the product does not perform as intended and the company is not successful in resolving product quality or performance issues  there could be an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  during the fourth quarter  the company was notified by one of its major customers of an intermittent problem involving one of its products that is installed in the field 
the company believes it has identified a firmware fix for this problem and may be required to share in the expense associated with this upgrade 
potential volatility of stock price 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the telecommunication network access and equipment industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
company specific factors or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock price and share trading volume since its initial public offering in june there is no assurance that such fluctuations will not continue 
dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
the company s future results of operations are highly dependent on market acceptance of existing and future applications for both the company s access system and the access system product lines 
the access system product line represented approximately of sales in fiscal  of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal market acceptance of both the company s current and future product lines is dependent on a number of factors  not all of which are in the company s control  including the continued growth in the use of bandwidth intensive applications  continued deployment of new telecommunications services  market acceptance of integrated access devices in general  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  and the success of the company s sales efforts 
failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to introduce new products in a timely manner could cause companies to purchase products from competitors and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to a variety of factors  the company may experience delays in developing its planned products 
new products may require additional development work  enhancement  testing or further refinement before the company can make them commercially available 
the company has in the past experienced delays in the introduction of new products  product applications and enhancements due to a variety of internal factors  such as reallocation of priorities  difficulty in hiring sufficient qualified personnel and unforeseen technical obstacles  as well as changes in customer requirements 
such delays have deferred the receipt of revenue from the products involved 
if the company s products have performance  reliability or quality shortcomings  then the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses 
risks associated with the acquisition of txport 
in addition to risks described below under risks associated with potential acquisitions  the company faces significant risks associated with its recent acquisition of txport and related reduction in workforce associated with the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize the desired benefits of this acquisition 
in order to successfully integrate txport  the company must  among other things  continue to attract and retain key personnel  integrate the acquired products and technology from engineering  sales and marketing perspectives  and consolidate functions and facilities 
difficulties encountered in the integration may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company applied the purchase method of accounting in connection with its acquisition of txport  resulting in a charge to be taken in each of the next three to ten years for the amortization of intangible assets 
risks associated with year there can be no assurances that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs or liabilities to the company 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company 
moreover  the company s products directly and indirectly interact with a large number of other hardware and software systems could contain defects associated with the year date 
the company is unable to predict to what extent its business may be affected if its software or the systems that operate in conjunction with its products experience a material year related failure 
any year defect in the company s products or the software and hardware systems with which the company s products operate could expose the company to litigation that could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the risks of such litigation may be particularly acute due to the mission critical applications for which the company s products are used 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues  and the company is aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
the company could also experience serious unanticipated negative consequences caused by undetected year defects in its internal systems  including third party software and hardware products 
internal systems are primarily composed of third party software and third party hardware which contain embedded software and the company s own software products 
for example  the company could experience a i corruption of data contained in the company s internal information systems or a ii failure of hardware  software  or other information technology systems  causing an interruption or failure of normal business operations 
any such events could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  the company could experience serious unanticipated negative consequences caused by the failure of services or products provided by third parties that are critical to the continued day to day operations of the company  such as electrical power  telecommunications services  and shipping services particularly outside of countries such as the united states where year remediation has progressed the furthest  which consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company s business operations 
in addition  a widely predicted freeze in deployment of new communications systems by large corporations in the second half of calendar year related to remediation of the yk problem could result in an unusual fluctuation of orders  in which an unusually large number of orders are received in the middle of  followed by an unusual decrease in orders in subsequent quarters 
enterprise resource planning erp 
the company went live in march with an upgrade to its enterprise wide database and information management systems  based principally on software from oracle 
this change in systems and processes was substantial  and involved significant outside contract resources to implement 
due to the relative immaturity of this system implementation and the need to move it to huntsville  alabama  problems with the system  due to software or configuration problems  or lack of trained personnel could cause delays in order processing  shipments of products  and in the accumulation and analysis of financial data 
there can be no assurance that these problems  if they occur  will not have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results from operations 
competition 
the market for telecommunications network access equipment is highly competitive  and the company expects competition to increase in the future 
this market is subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments  and new entrants 
the market for integrated access devices such as the company s access system product line is subject to rapid change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors in this market are the development and rapid introduction of new product features  price and performance  support for multiple types of communications services  network management  reliability  and quality of customer support 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products and future products under development will be able to compete successfully with respect to these or other factors 
the company s principal competition to date for its current access system products has been from digital link corporation  kentrox  a division of adc telecommunications and larscom  inc  a subsidiary of axel johnson 
in addition  the company expects substantial competition from companies in the computer networking market and other related markets such as newbridge networks corporation  telco systems  inc  a division of world access  inc  visual networks inc  and adtran  inc 
to the extent that current or potential competitors can expand their current offerings to include products that have functionality similar to the company s products and planned products  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the market for basic network termination products is mature and that the principal competitive factors in this market are price  installed base and quality of customer support 
in this market  the company primarily competes with adtran  digital link  kentrox  paradyne and larscom 
there can be no assurance that such companies or other competitors will not introduce new products that provide greater functionality and or at a lower price than the company s like products 
in addition  advanced termination products are emerging which represent both new market opportunities as well as a threat to current products 
furthermore  basic line termination functions are increasingly being integrated by competitors  such as cisco and nortel networks  into other equipment such as routers and switches 
these include direct wan interfaces in certain products  eroding the addressable market for separate network termination products 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of the company s competitors have long established relationships with network service providers 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the financial resources  technical expertise  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
rapid technological change 
the network access and telecommunications equipment markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely selection  development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation 
the development of new products for the wan access market requires competence in the general areas of telephony  data networking  network management and wireless telephony as well as specific technologies such as dsl  isdn  frame relay  atm and ip 
furthermore  the communications industry is characterized by the need to design products which meet industry standards for safety  emissions and network interconnection 
with new and emerging technologies and service offerings from network service providers  such standards are often changing or unavailable 
as a result  there is a potential for product development delays due to the need for compliance with new or modified standards 
the introduction of new and enhanced products also requires that the company manage transitions from older products in order to minimize disruptions in customer orders  avoid excess inventory of old products and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer orders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products  or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected if the company were to be unsuccessful  or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements 
see dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to meet a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the united states  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories and bell communications research 
for some public carrier services  installed equipment does not fully comply with current industry standards  and this noncompliance must be addressed in the design of the company s products 
standards for new services such as frame relay  performance monitoring services and atm are still evolving 
as these standards evolve  the company will be required to modify its products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the pricing of existing as well as new public network services and therefore are expected to affect demand for such services and the telecommunications products that support such services 
tariff rates  whether determined by network service providers or in response to regulatory directives  may affect the cost effectiveness of deploying communication services 
such policies also affect demand for telecommunications equipment  including the company s products 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
an important element of the company s strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would compliment its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer growth opportunities 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results and or the price of the company s common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
the company s management has limited prior experience in assimilating acquired organizations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company to date has had minimal direct sales to customers outside of north america 
the company has little experience in the european and far eastern markets  but intends to expand sales of its products outside of north america and to enter certain international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
conducting business outside of north america is subject to certain risks  including longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent any company sales are denominated in foreign currency  the company s sales and results of operations may also be directly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the consultative committee on international telegraph and telephony 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the united states could delay or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of third party claims of infringement 
the network access and telecommunications equipment industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company 
the company has not conducted a formal patent search relating to the technology used in its products  due in part to the high cost and limited benefits of a formal search 
in addition  since patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the related patent is issued and foreign patent applications generally are not publicly disclosed for at least a portion of the time that they are pending  applications may have been filed which  if issued as patents  could relate to the company s products 
software comprises a substantial portion of the technology in the company s products 
the scope of protection accorded to patents covering software related inventions is evolving and is subject to a degree of uncertainty which may increase the risk and cost to the company if the company discovers third party patents related to its software products or if such patents are asserted against the company in the future 
patents have been granted recently on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may be issued which relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into the company s products 
the company has received and may receive in the future communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
in its distribution agreements  the company typically agrees to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses from third parties 
there can be no assurance that licenses from third parties would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the failure of the company to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
limited protection of intellectual property 
the company relies upon a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
the company has been issued certain us and canadian patents with respect to limited aspects of its single purpose network access technology 
the company has not obtained significant patent protection for its access system technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties have not or will not develop equivalent technologies or products without infringing the company s patents or that the company s patents would be held valid and enforceable by a court having jurisdiction over a dispute involving such patents 
the company has also entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and independent contractors  and enters into non disclosure agreements with its suppliers  distributors and appropriate customers so as to limit access to and disclosure of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that these statutory and contractual arrangements will deter misappropriation of the company s technologies or discourage independent third party development of similar technologies 
in the event such arrangements are insufficient  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus  make the possibility of misappropriation of the company s technology and products more likely 
antitakeover effects of certain charter provisions 
the company s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the company 
the company has no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prohibit the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
furthermore  certain provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation  including provisions that provide for the board of directors to be divided into three classes to serve for staggered three year terms  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material
