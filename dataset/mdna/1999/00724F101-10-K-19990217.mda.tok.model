the company offers a market leading line of applications software products  type products  and content for creating  distributing  and managing information of all types  licenses its technology to major hardware manufacturers  software developers  and service providers  and offers integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes 
the company distributes its products through a network of original equipment manufacturer oem customers  distributors and dealers  and value added resellers vars and systems integrators and has operations in north america  europe  japan  asia pacific and latin america 
revenue change change total revenue total revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the ongoing weakness in the japanese economy and a decline in licensing revenue related to the company s postscript technology 
the revenue growth in fiscal compared to fiscal was essentially attributable to increased sales of application products resulting from the release of new and enhanced products 
in fiscal  revenue from one major distributor of application products accounted for of the company s total revenue 
no customer accounted for more than of the company s total revenue in fiscal or change change product revenue licensing percentage of total revenue licensing revenue is made up of royalties received from oem customers who ship products containing adobe s postscript technology  including adobe postscript  adobe postscript  adobe printgear  and postscript extreme 
adobe postscript is a software language for describing to a printer the appearance of a page  including text  graphics  and images 
products containing adobe postscript technology that implement the language include black and white printers  color printers  slide recorders  imagesetters  screen displays  and digital copiers 
adobe postscript products serve the corporate enterprise  graphic arts  production printing  small office home office markets  and high volume production printing markets 
licensing revenue is also derived from shipments of products containing the configurable postscript interpreter cpsi by oem customers 
cpsi is a fully functional adobe postscript interpreter that resides on the host computer system rather than in a dedicated controller integrated into an output device 
the configuration flexibility of cpsi allows oem customers and software developers to create and market a variety of adobe postscript products independently of controller hardware development 
licensing revenue in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to weakness in the japanese personal computer and printer markets  as well as a reduction in royalty revenue from hewlett packard company s hp desktop monochrome laser printer division which has been incorporating a clone version of adobe postscript into some of its products since the fall of licensing revenue in fiscal was unchanged from fiscal as increased demand for cpsi  color capability  and adobe printgear products was offset by a number of factors affecting oem customers  primarily in the japanese and macintosh markets 
these factors included  but were not limited to  continuing weakness in macintosh related printer sales and in japanese personal computer and printer markets  as well as a slow pace of certain new technologies being brought to market by oem customers 
the company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue in the short term because of japanese market conditions  the uncertain timing of new product releases by oem customers incorporating adobe s latest technologies  and the anticipated full impact of loss of revenue from hp s monchrome laser printer products 
in addition  oem customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
the company evaluates these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue to the company 
as a result of these conditions  the oem licensing business is likely to decline in fiscal however  the company anticipates growth opportunities in the digital copier marketplace that is expected to increase licensing revenue in the long term 
change change product revenue application products percentage of total revenue application products revenue is derived predominantly from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail and var distribution channels  with the exception of adobe photodeluxe  which is primarily distributed through oem bundling agreements with digital camera  scanner  and personal computer manufacturers 
application products revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to the release of two major professional publishing products  adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator  increased revenue from acrobat  as the portable document format pdf upon which acrobat is based continued to gain acceptance worldwide  and increased revenues from the company s new web products  adobe imagestyler and adobe imageready  which have received favorable reviews and market reception 
in addition  the release of adobe photodeluxe business edition and adobe premiere  the company s video editing product  contributed to the overall increase in application products revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenues from various products  primarily adobe pagemaker  adobe framemaker and adobe type manager  all of which did not release upgrades during the year 
overall  the company s revenue increase was smaller than expected as a result of adverse economic conditions in japan 
application products revenue increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to major product releases and upgrades  which included adobe pagemaker  adobe illustrator  and adobe framemaker 
in addition  increased demand for adobe photoshop  the adobe acrobat family of products  and adobe photodeluxe contributed to the increase 
overall  revenue from the company s applications products on the windows platform increased by in fiscal over fiscal  while application products revenue from the macintosh platform decreased during the same period 
in fiscal  the windows and macintosh platforms accounted for and  respectively  of applications products revenue  excluding platform independent and unix products  compared to and  respectively  in fiscal the company expects this trend toward the windows platform to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company remains cautious about the economic conditions in japan as well as the fluctuating economic conditions in other asian and latin american countries 
direct costs change change direct costs percentage of total revenue direct costs include product packaging  third party royalties  amortization of localization costs and acquired technologies  and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of revenue  in general  is affected by the mix of licensing revenue versus application products revenue  as well as the product mix within application products 
direct costs decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to lower packaging costs and the company s full transition from distribution of its products on disk to cd rom media 
direct costs also decreased in fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal as certain acquired technologies became fully amortized in fiscal and the company incurred lower product localization costs 
the company anticipates that direct costs will increase in fiscal due to increased costs necessary to support higher anticipated application products revenue 
however  on a percentage of revenue basis  direct costs are expected to be the same or slightly lower than fiscal operating expenses change change research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars over the past three years due to the expansion of the company s engineering staff and related costs required to support its continued emphasis on developing new products and enhancing existing products 
the increase also reflects the company s increased investments in new technologies  new product development  and the infrastructure to support such activities 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal was partially offset by certain cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program that was implemented during the third quarter of fiscal the company also experienced reduced outside labor costs and professional fees as certain research and development programs were discontinued see management s discussion and analysis of restructuring and other charges 
the company believes that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
the company will continue to make significant investments in the development of its application software products  including those targeted for the growing internet market 
while the company expects that research and development expenditures in fiscal will increase in absolute dollars  such expenditures as a percentage of revenue are expected to remain approximately the same or lower than fiscal change change sales and marketing percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for the company s sales  marketing  customer support  and distribution personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  and other market development programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to higher employee costs related to increased staffing  increased customer support costs to support new products and customers  and increased marketing and advertising activities 
as a result of the increase in sales and marketing staff  as well as the growth in application products revenue  higher commissions were paid in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  sales and marketing expenses included higher outside labor costs to support user education related to new product releases and for the development of the company s web site  as well as new public relations activities in connection with the employment of a national public relations agency 
these increased expenses were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented during the third quarter of fiscal that eliminated certain advertising campaigns and other marketing activities related to the divestiture of a business unit see management s discussion and analysis of restructuring and other charges 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for upgrades of existing products and further development of customer and technical support services to support a growing installed base of customers 
while the company expects that sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  such expenditures as a percentage of revenue are expected to remain approximately the same or lower than fiscal change change general and administrative percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for the finance  human resources  legal  information services  and executive personnel of the company 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  amortization of goodwill  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to increased expenses for outside legal and investment banking services associated with responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal  as well as increased employee costs and related depreciation and building expenses associated with increased staff 
additionally  the provision for uncollectible accounts increased to reserve for accounts receivable from certain customers that were deemed potentially uncollectible 
these increased expenses were partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented in the third quarter of fiscal that included a reduction in general office and other administrative expenses see management s discussion and analysis of restructuring and other charges 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to higher information system costs  legal costs  and employee costs primarily associated with a more comprehensive administrative infrastructure 
the company expects general and administrative spending in fiscal to increase in absolute dollars over fiscal to support future administrative infrastructure needs 
however  on a percentage of revenue basis  general and administrative expenses are not expected to be materially different than fiscal change change write off of acquired in process research and development percentage of total revenue during fiscal  the company acquired three software companies  in separate transactions  for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of the acquisitions 
one of the in process technologies acquired for million was discontinued in fiscal the project associated with an additional million of the purchased in process technology was canceled as part of the restructuring in the third quarter of fiscal and subsequently sold to a management led buyout group 
during fiscal  the company acquired ares software for approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of the acquisition 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was based on a valuation prepared by an independent third party  estimating both the cost of developing and incorporating the in process technology into future versions of postscript and the future cash flows from the enhanced postscript product  using a discount factor which takes into consideration the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the in process technology was completed in fiscal and incorporated into postscript actual revenues  in aggregate  to date  together with revised forcasted revenues  are expected to exceed the original estimate of revenues used to value the in process technology 
in november  the company also acquired in process research and development from swell software for approximately million 
the research project was discontinued prior to reaching technological feasibility in early fiscal the company reclassified million and million of in process research and development recognized during the first half of fiscal to research and development and general and administrative expenses  respectively  for the fiscal year ending november  financial statements 
restructuring and other charges change change restructuring and other charges na percentage of total revenue in the third quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring program aimed at streamlining its underlying cost structure to better position the company for growth and profitability 
as part of the restructuring program  the company implemented a reduction in force of positions  primarily in its north american operations 
the reductions came predominantly from overhead areas  divested business units and redundant marketing activities  and as of august   the majority of these terminations were completed 
in addition to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force  the restructuring program included charges for divesting two business units  vacating leased facilities  and canceling certain contracts 
these actions and other non restructuring related items resulted in charges of million  of which approximately million were non cash charges 
for detailed information regarding the company s restructuring program  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that  as a result of the restructuring program  annualized pre tax savings of million will be realized 
approximately of the savings are the result of the reduction in force and the remaining savings are the result of reductions in marketing and facilities expense  as well as other discretionary savings  such as travel and outside services 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal include a gain of million related to the divestiture of a product line partially offset by a million charge related to the acquisition of intellectual property 
restructuring and other charges in fiscal include charges of million related to the disposition of two business units previously owned by an acquired company less the reversal of million of excess reserves related to restructuring costs recorded in prior years 
nonoperating income change change investment gain percentage of total revenue investment gain consists principally of realized gains or losses from direct investments as well as mark to market valuation adjustments for investments held by adobe incentive partners  lp aip 
in fiscal  the company recorded a realized gain of million related to the company s investment in mcqueen international limited mcqueen due to the acquisition of mcqueen by sykes enterprises  incorporated sykes  a publicly traded company 
in addition  the company liquidated its investment in siebel systems  incorporated siebel through the distribution to its stockholders of approximately  shares of siebel common stock as a dividend in kind and the sale of its remaining siebel shares 
a gain was recognized on the transaction of approximately million 
the remaining net realized gain recorded by the company in fiscal represents valuation adjustments recorded by the company related to its venture investments held by aip 
in fiscal  the investment gain related primarily to the company s liquidation of its investment in netscape communications corporation netscape through the distribution to its stockholders of  shares of netscape common stock as a dividend in kind and the sale of its remaining netscape shares 
the fiscal gain arose primarily as a result of realized gains of approximately million and approximately million for the sale of a portion of the company s investment in netscape and its entire investment in luminous corporation  respectively 
also  a portion of one of the equity investments included in the adobe ventures lp portfolio was sold for a gain of million during fiscal  and at november   the remaining portion of this investment was marked to market for an unrealized gain of approximately million 
these and other gains were partially offset by write downs on certain other investments 
the company is uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
change change interest and other income percentage of total revenue interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses 
the decrease in interest and other income during fiscal compared to fiscal is due to lower average cash and short term investment balances in fiscal  primarily as a result of cash used for stock repurchases in fiscal and late fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal from fiscal is related to higher average cash balances 
interest income is expected to decrease in fiscal due to lower average cash balances resulting from stock repurchases conducted in fiscal further  the company s cash balances could also be reduced in fiscal due to the purchase of software companies  products  or technologies complementary to the company s business 
income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate increased in fiscal from fiscal principally as a result of the nondeductible write off of goodwill and lower tax exempt interest income 
the fiscal tax rate decreased from fiscal primarily due to lower nondeductible charges for the write off of acquired in process research and development and higher tax exempt income 
the company anticipates that the tax rate in fiscal will not be materially different than the tax rate in fiscal factors that may affect future results of operations the company believes that in the future its results of operations could be affected by various factors  such as delays in shipment of the company s new products and major new versions of existing products  lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades  the introduction of competitive products by third parties  weakness in demand for macintosh application software and macintosh related printers  renegotiation of royalty arrangements  growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and sales price adjustments  consolidation in the oem printer business  ongoing weakness in the company s printing business due to product transitions  industry transitions to new business and information delivery models  ongoing weakness in the japanese and other asian economies  year issues as discussed later under year issues  and adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which the company does business 
the company has stated that in fiscal its annual revenue growth target is and its operating margin target is of total revenue 
these targets are used to assist the company s management in making decisions about the allocation of resources and investments  not as predictions of future results 
the targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about the company s pricing  manufacturing costs and volumes and the mix of application products and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels and geographic distribution 
these and many other factors described herein affect the company s financial performance and may cause the company s future results  including results for the current quarter  to vary materially from these targets 
the company s ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs  may also have an impact on the results of operations 
the company s ability to extend its core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect its ability to develop these products 
a portion of the company s future revenue will come from these new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions  whether by the company or its oem customers  could have an adverse effect on the company s revenue  earnings  or stock price 
the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on its revenue or results of operations 
the market for the company s graphics applications  particularly the consumer products  is intensely and increasingly competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
additionally  microsoft corporation has stated its intention to increase its presence in the digital imaging graphics market by mid  the company believes that  due to microsoft s market dominance  any new microsoft digital imaging products will be highly competitive with the company s products 
if competing new products achieve widespread acceptance  it would have a significant adverse impact on the company s operating results 
although the company generally offers its application products on macintosh  windows  and unix platforms  a majority of the overall revenue from these products prior to fiscal has been from the macintosh platform  particularly for the higher end macintosh computers 
in the last two years  windows based application revenue exceeded that from the macintosh platform  and for the past several quarters  macintosh platform sales of application products have continued to decline year over year while windows platform sales have continued to rise 
if there is a continuing slowdown of customer purchases in the higher end macintosh market  or if the company is unable to continue to increase its revenue from windows customers commensurate with such a slowdown  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers in general  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
also  as the company seeks to further broaden its customer base to achieve greater penetration in the corporate business and consumer markets  the company may not successfully adapt its application software distribution channels  which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in its distribution channels that could materially adversely affect its operating results 
the company continues to expand into third party distribution channels  including value added resellers and systems integrators  in its effort to further broaden its customer base 
as a result  the financial health of these third parties  and the company s continuing relationships with them  are becoming more important to the company s success 
some of these companies are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions 
the company s financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of certain of these third parties substantially weakens or if the company s relationships with them deteriorate 
the company s printing revenue experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal product transitions  as the company transitions its customers from adobe postscript level to adobe postscript and postscript extreme  along with weakness in the japanese market  primarily caused the revenue decline 
if this trend continues  the company s financial results could be adversely affected 
in addition  in the fall of fiscal  hp began to ship a clone version of adobe postscript in some printers  resulting in lower licensing revenue to the company in fiscal  even though the company continues to work with hp printer operations to incorporate adobe postscript and other technologies in other hp products 
the company expects lower licensing revenue from hp in fiscal further  oem customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
the company evaluates these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue for the company 
during late fiscal and throughout fiscal  the company experienced a decline in both application and licensing revenue from the japanese market due to a weak japanese computer market and general economic conditions in japan 
in addition  at the end of fiscal  inventory levels for applications products at the company s japanese distributors remained higher than what the company considers normal 
during fiscal  the company worked with its major distributors in japan to reduce channel inventory to what the company considers a reasonable level 
the company expects these adverse economic conditions to continue in the short term  and they may continue to adversely affect the company s revenue and earnings 
although there are also adverse conditions in other asian and latin american economies  the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of the company s revenue and thus have less impact on the company s operational results 
the company has recently implemented a restructuring of its business and reduced its workforce by more than 
however  the company plans to continue to invest in certain areas  which will require it to hire additional employees 
competition for high quality personnel  especially highly skilled engineers  is extremely intense 
the company s ability to effectively manage its growth will require it to continue to improve its operational and financial controls and information management systems  and to attract  retain  motivate  and manage employees effectively 
the failure of the company to effectively manage growth and transition in multiple areas of its business could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communications over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing authoring and communications over the internet is young and has few proven products 
standards defining web graphics have not yet been finally adopted 
in addition  new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating income from its subsidiaries located in europe  japan  and asia pacific and latin america 
the company generally experiences lower revenue from its european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months 
additionally  the company is uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in the japan and asia pacific and latin america markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions 
while most of the revenue of the european subsidiaries is denominated in us dollars  the majority of revenue derived from japan is denominated in yen and the majority of all subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies 
as a result  the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the accounting impact of such fluctuations has been insignificant 
the company s hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks  based on management s best judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity  and expense 
the company has established a hedging program to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily of the japanese yen 
the company s hedging program is not comprehensive  and there can be no assurance that the program will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
based on its preliminary assessment  the company does not believe the conversion will have a material impact on the competitiveness of its products in europe  where there already exists substantial price transparency  or increase the likelihood of contract cancellations 
further  the company expects that modifications to comply with euro requirements have been and will continue to be made to its business operations and systems on a timely basis and does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to continue to complete such modifications on a timely basis  any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the company faces risks to the extent that suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors upon whom the company relies and their suppliers are unable to make appropriate modifications to support euro transactions 
the inability of such third parties to support euro transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in connection with the enforcement of its own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  the company has been and may in the future be subject to complex  protracted litigation as part of its policy to vigorously defend its intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although the company has successfully defended past litigation  there can be no assurance that it will prevail in any ongoing or future litigation 
adverse decisions in such litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from others  prevent the company from manufacturing or selling certain of its products  or cause severe disruptions to the company s operations or the markets in which it competes  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on the company s reported results  and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of the company s business  including rules relating to software revenue recognition  purchase and pooling of interests accounting for business combinations  the valuation of in process research and development  employee stock purchase plans and stock option grants have recently been revised or are under review by one or more groups 
changes to these rules  or the questioning of current practices  may have a significant adverse effect on the company s reported financial results or in the way in which the company conducts its business 
due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have  and has had in the past  an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
additionally  the company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
finally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to the company  changes in analysts earnings estimates for the company or its industry and factors affecting the corporate environment  the company s industry or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of the company s common stock price 
year issues the company is addressing a broad range of issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for the company from unforeseen problems in its products or its own computer and embedded systems and from third parties with whom the company deals on financial and other transactions worldwide 
failure of the company s and or third parties computer systems or year defects in the company s products could have a material impact on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company has commenced a phased program to inventory  assess  remediate  test  implement and develop contingency plans for all mission critical applications and products potentially affected by the year issue the yk program 
to accelerate overall completion  activities in each phase are often concurrent rather than serial  but all phases  except developing contingency plans  are expected to be completed by mid additionally  the company has opened a dedicated year test laboratory for both internal business process and product testing 
all company business groups are involved in the yk program efforts 
the company has identified three potential areas of impact for review the software and systems  including embedded systems  used in the company s internal business processes  third party vendors  manufacturers and suppliers  and the company s software products offered to customers 
the company s current estimate of the aggregate costs to be incurred for the yk program is approximately million  which is expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
if the company encounters significant unforeseen year problems  either in its products or internal business systems or in relation to third party vendors  manufacturers or suppliers  actual costs could materially exceed this estimate 
internal business processes 
the company has substantially completed its inventory of year impacted software and is assessing its centralized computer and embedded systems to identify any potential year issues 
the company s financial information systems include an sap system recently implemented in the united states  japan  and asia pacific and latin america  and an oracle system in europe that has recently been upgraded to a recent version 
sap and oracle have informed the company  and the company believes  that these systems are year compliant 
the company has a number of projects underway to replace or upgrade hardware and software that are known to be year non compliant 
the company currently expects to substantially complete remediation  validation and implementation of its internal systems by mid in addition  in order to protect against the acquisition of additional products that may not be year ready  the company has implemented a policy requiring year review of products sold or licensed to the company prior to their acquisition 
however  if implementation of replacement or upgraded systems or software is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
third party vendors  manufacturers and suppliers 
the company is also in the process of contacting its critical suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors to determine that their operations and the products and services that they provide to the company are year compliant 
where practicable  the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of third parties to be year ready  including developing contingency plans 
however  such failures  including failures of any contingency plan  remain a possibility and could have a materially adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
products 
in addition  the year issue could affect the products that the company licenses 
the company is continuing to test its products and gather information about company technologies and products impacted by the year transition 
current information about the company s products is available on the company s year web site www 
adobe 
com newsfeatures year 
information on the company s web site is provided to customers for the sole purpose of assisting in planning for the transition to the year such information is the most currently available concerning the company s products and is provided as is without warranty of any kind 
there can be no assurance that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year that may result in material costs to the company 
contingency plans 
the company has not yet developed contingency plans to address situations that may result if the company is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations  including operations under the control of third parties 
additionally  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
development of such contingency plans is in progress and is expected to be completed by september there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop contingency plans that will adequately address all year issues that may arise 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues  and the company is aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
the impact of the year on future company revenue is difficult to discern but is a risk to be considered in evaluating future growth of the company

derivatives and financial instruments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments the company transacts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries and japan 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated licenses in japan and local currency denominated operating expenses in europe  where the company licenses primarily in us dollars 
the company s japanese operating expenses are in yen  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen denominated licenses in japan 
in addition  the company hedges firmly committed transactions using primarily forward contracts with maturities of less than three months 
the company also hedges a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased options 
at november   total outstanding contracts include million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased japanese yen put option contracts with a notional value of million 
all contracts expire at various times through march the company s hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements  and any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio is expected to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the company s hedging portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
an increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of the company s financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
the company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on the company s designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
gains and losses associated with the mark to market of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of existing transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are recognized in income in the current period 
corresponding gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated transactions being hedged are recognized in income in that same period 
in this manner  the gains and losses on foreign currency denominated transactions will be offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency contracts 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these instruments 
the company uses yen options to hedge anticipated exposures 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does the company hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in europe 
instead  the company believes that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenue from product upgrades substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
the company assesses the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge european currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
the company regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program 
fixed income investments at november   the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  and restricted funds and security deposits of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of the company s fixed income securities 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the company s investment portfolio as of november  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus  or plus basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the market value changes for a   or basis point increase in short term treasury security yields were not material due to the limited duration of the company s portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
the company does  however  limit its exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for its fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to one issue  issuer  as well as the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in the company s guidelines  the exposure to market and credit risk is not expected to be material 
facility leases the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases of on its facilities whose payments are tied to the london interbank offered rate libor and has evaluated the hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the libor rate 
market changes reflected immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the libor curve of plus or minus   and basis points for a twelve month period 
based on this analysis  such charges would not be material to the company s results of operations or financial position
