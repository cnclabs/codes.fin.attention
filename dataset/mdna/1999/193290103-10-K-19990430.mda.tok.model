see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of continuing operations for the three fiscal years ended january  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of the form k 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the inclusion in fiscal of additional cole vision units  including the avc stores acquired in august  and a consolidated comparable store sales increase of 
the consolidated comparable store sales increase in fiscal reflected a comparable store sales increase of at cole vision and at things remembered 
the cole vision comparable store sales increase resulted from a increase at cole licensed brands partially offset by a decrease at pearle 
the cole vision sales increase reflected an increase in the number of transactions due to more locations  as the average selling price was essentially flat between years 
the pearle comparable store sales were impacted by a weaker than expected reception to marketing and merchandising programs implemented in the first quarter  as well as increased competitive pressures in the optical business and what the company perceives may be a general softening in the retail optical market 
at things remembered  the comparable store sales growth reflected increased sales of additional personalization and new products increasing the average transaction amount  while the number of transactions in fiscal was similar to fiscal at january   the company had  retail locations including things remembered stores   licensed brands locations and pearle stores  of which were franchised locations  compared to  retail locations at january  gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the gross profit increase was primarily attributable to the increased revenue at both cole vision and things remembered  partially offset by million of inventory markdowns at pearle in connection with restructuring its operations 
excluding the inventory markdowns  gross margins were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
gross margin at things remembered improved to in fiscal from the prior year with most of the improvement from increased personalization sales 
at cole vision gross margins were in both fiscal and fiscal operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the unfavorable expense leverage was attributable to a percentage point increase in managed vision care expenses  a percentage point increase in information systems costs including million incurred in connection with the company s year readiness program see year below for additional information and a percentage point increase in advertising expenditures  partially offset by a percentage point leverage gain in store occupancy costs 
the increase in managed vision care expenses was primarily the result of increased administrative costs necessary to handle the growth in call and claims volume 
the increase in advertising expenditures as a percentage of revenue was mainly due to inefficient advertising efforts at cole vision  a result of the optical market conditions mentioned above and the unexpected weakness of pearle s first quarter marketing and merchandising programs 
store occupancy expenses increased as a result of more locations and higher percentage rents caused by increased comparable store sales but gained leverage from the strong comparable store sales increase at things remembered 
payroll costs also increased primarily because of more retail units open in and additional payroll to support increased sales  maintaining leverage to last year 
fiscal depreciation and amortization expense of million was million more than fiscal reflecting increased amortization of systems development costs and the avc acquisition in fiscal fiscal included a million pretax charge for restructuring and other unusual items  including the inventory markdowns at pearle  and fiscal included an million pretax charge for non recurring items related to the integration of avc into the company s operations 
see restructuring  business integration and other unusual charges below 
operating income  excluding the charges for restructuring  business integration and other unusual charges from each year  decreased to million in fiscal from million the prior year  as improved sales and earnings at things remembered and cole licensed brands were more than offset by the disappointing results at pearle 
net interest expense and other income for fiscal of million decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of million of other income in the third quarter of fiscal from cash received in the non taxable settlement of certain contingencies related to several claims against and indemnifications from the former owner of pearle  and lower interest expense following the purchase and retirement of million of senior notes in connection with a tender offer in september  partially offset by additional interest expense on million of senior subordinated notes due issued in august the income tax provisions for fiscal and include million and million  respectively  of income tax benefits related to the charges for restructuring and other unusual items 
the effective tax rate on income excluding these charges and the million settlement included in other income was in fiscal and in fiscal this rate reflects the significant impact of non deductible amortization of goodwill in both years 
a more complete discussion of income taxes is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income increased to million in fiscal from a net loss of million the prior year 
the net loss in fiscal included a million loss  net of an income tax benefit of million  related to the operations and closing of cole gift centers and a million extraordinary loss  net of an income tax benefit of million  recorded in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with the early extinguishment of debt 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt represented the tender premium  write off of related unamortized debt discount and other costs associated with redemption of the senior notes 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue increased to billion in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of pearle and aoco limited  which operated sears locations in canada  in november  and avc in august  which accounted for million of the increase for the fiscal year 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisitions 
consolidated comparable store sales increased in fiscal with a comparable store growth at cole vision and a comparable store sales decline at things remembered 
the cole vision comparable store sales increase resulted from a increase at cole licensed brands and a increase at pearle 
the increase at cole vision was primarily a result of successful eyewear promotions and growth in managed vision care sales 
the net revenue increase was also attributable to the classification of capitation and other fees associated with its growing managed vision care business as revenue 
prior to fiscal  such fees were netted with operating expenses in the financial statements 
for fiscal  these fees were approximately million 
the opening of additional cole vision and things remembered units also contributed to the revenue increase 
at january   the company had  retail locations  including things remembered stores   licensed brand locations and pearle stores  of which were franchised locations  compared to  retail locations at february  gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the gross profit increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions and the growth of managed vision care fees now classified as revenue 
gross margins for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the lower gross margin percentage in fiscal resulted primarily from the addition of pearle which operates at a lower gross margin than the company has historically experienced due to the higher costs of in store laboratories and lower margin wholesale sales to franchised stores 
this was partially offset by revenue generated by pearle s franchise royalties and fees  interest income on pearle s franchise notes receivable and the managed vision care fees  each of which has no corresponding cost of goods sold 
as a result  gross margin at cole vision was in fiscal compared to in fiscal at things remembered  gross margin was and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the lower gross margin at things remembered was primarily attributable to increased sales of clearance and promotional merchandise  partially offset by an increase in sales of additional personalization 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the leverage improvement was primarily a result of the addition of pearle  which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than the rest of the company  along with leverage gains achieved by cole vision s comparable store sales increase 
this was offset in part by leverage losses at things remembered resulting from the decline in comparable store sales 
operating expenses increased primarily because of the acquisitions and the classification of capitation and other fees as revenue 
the expense increase reflected higher advertising expenditures  payroll costs  and store occupancy expenses  as well as expenses related to the growth of managed vision care 
advertising expenditures at cole vision were increased for optical promotions and pearle name awareness 
payroll costs increased because of more higher volume retail units open in and additional payroll to support increased sales 
store occupancy expenses increased primarily as a result of more locations and higher percentage rents caused by increased comparable store sales 
as a percentage of revenue  payroll and store occupancy costs improved by and percentage points  respectively  over fiscal  partially offset by the leverage loss from other operating expenses which were affected by the reclassification of managed vision care fees 
fiscal depreciation and amortization expense of million was million more than fiscal reflecting the acquisitions and an increase in capital expenditures 
the third and fourth quarter of fiscal included a total of million of charges for non recurring items related to integration of avc into the company s operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a million pretax charge was recorded for certain unusual non recurring items primarily related to the integration and consolidation of pearle 
see restructuring  business integration and other unusual charges below 
operating income  excluding charges for business integration and other unusual items from each year  increased to million in fiscal from million the prior year  primarily the result of the acquisitions and comparable store sales growth at cole vision  offset in part by soft sales performance at things remembered 
net interest expense for fiscal of million increased million compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the additional interest expense on million of senior subordinated notes due issued in connection with financing the pearle acquisition and million of notes 
this was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the purchase and subsequent retirement of million of senior notes in the second quarter of fiscal and the purchase and retirement of an additional million of the senior notes in conjunction with a tender offer in september the income tax provisions for fiscal and include million and million  respectively  of income tax benefits related to the charges for business integration and other unusual items 
the effective tax rate on income excluding the charge for business integration and other unusual items was in fiscal and in fiscal this rate reflects the significant impact of non deductible amortization of goodwill in both years 
the net loss in fiscal of million included a million loss  net of an income tax benefit of million  related to the operations and closing of cole gift centers and a million extraordinary loss  net of an income tax benefit of million  recorded in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with the early extinguishment of debt 
a similar charge for million  net of an income tax benefit of million  was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal restructuring  business integration and other unusual charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million pretax charge primarily related to its acquisition of pearle  which included costs related to the integration and consolidation of pearle into the company s operations  as well as other unusual charges 
the charge included million for store closings  million for other facility closings  million related to computer systems  which included the settlement costs of terminating an outsourcing agreement  million for the writeoff of goodwill pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and of other unusual charges 
the other charges related to employee matters  including severance and hiring costs  costs associated with developing and implementing a new franchise agreement  and compensation costs associated with accelerated vesting of a stock option grant to executives 
in connection with the business integration charge  management developed a plan  approved by the board of directors  that among other things identified pearle stores that would be closed and in store labs that would be taken out of stores 
this plan consisted of a store by store analysis of profitability  size  lease term and type of lab 
in addition  the company decided to retain pearle s distribution and central lab facilities  but close the home office facility in dallas  texas 
the company s intent was to close the stores  on average  over a six month period and labs  on average  over an eighteen month period following february  the estimated costs of closure  primarily related to lease obligations and impairment of fixed assets  were determined based upon management s and pearle s past experience in closing stores and represented a portion of the remaining noncancellable term of the operating leases after the expected closing dates 
the estimate assumed the company would be able to avoid certain lease penalty provisions through negotiations with landlords 
this resulted in an accrual of million being recorded pursuant to eitf no 
as part of the original charge discussed above 
the company  whose integration efforts were initially focused primarily on the new franchise agreement  closed one store in each of the first and second quarters of fiscal the company then acquired avc in august  and recorded an additional million integration charge in fiscal  which included costs of closing an additional stores  six in store labs  the avc central lab and the avc home office  transitional costs incurred to change the brand identity to pearle and duplicate costs incurred through fiscal year end in connection with the consolidation of the avc home office functions 
the expected benefits of these business integration activities included a stronger franchise network and reductions in home office personnel and occupancy costs  purchasing costs for materials  manufacturing costs upon the completion of the removal of full in store labs and closing of the avc lab  and operating losses upon closure of certain unprofitable stores 
the consolidation of pearle s home office and purchasing functions was substantially completed in fiscal  with the exception of lab systems  which are expected to be completed in fiscal the consolidation of avc functions  including the shutdown of its central lab  was completed by the third quarter of fiscal negotiations with various landlords throughout fiscal proved more difficult than originally anticipated 
also  due to other priorities of integrating pearle and the acquisition of avc in mid fiscal  the original plan was not fully implemented by the end of fiscal at the end of fiscal management reaffirmed its intent to close the remaining stores and convert the lab locations as soon as practicable 
the estimated cost of closure was revised to equal the remaining lease liability assuming  on average  stores would be closed six months after january  this revised estimate did not differ materially from the previously established accrual and therefore no adjustment to the reserve was required 
had management s original plan corresponded to only the actual stores closed prior to january   the restructuring charges would have been reduced by million and million for the fiscal years ended february  and january   respectively 
of the facilities originally identified for closing  five stores were closed in the first quarter and one store was closed in the second quarter of fiscal  and full service labs were closed in the third quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  several consultants were retained to help assess various aspects of cole national corporation s optical operations 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  the original restructuring plan was revised and a net pretax charge of million was recorded  related to further restructuring of its pearle business along with other unusual charges 
the net pretax charge consisted of charges associated with the restructuring of million  a reversal of previously established restructuring accruals of million and other unusual charges totaling million 
the restructuring charge of million relates to changes made to the pearle operating model and structure of the home office organization 
consultants conducted market research and helped develop and implement changes to pearle s marketing message  merchandise offerings and presentation  store locations  organizational structure and other operational opportunities 
in addition  home office facilities and personnel  including cole managed vision care administration and systems were relocated and consolidated into one central facility 
the results of these efforts resulted in charges for inventory writedowns related to products that will no longer be carried  severance and hiring costs primarily related to home office organizational changes  consolidation of the home office facilities  including the writeoff of fixed assets at the old facilities  consultant fees and changing the pearle brand message through signing  production and other costs 
the charge related to the inventory writedown has been reflected in cost of sales in accordance with eitf no 
as part of the revised plan  which was approved by the board of directors in march  it was determined that certain stores originally identified for closure would either remain open or be closed at a much lower cost than originally estimated 
the plan is to close stores  of which nine were identified in the original store closing plan  over the next months and remove surfacing equipment from full service labs of stores over the next six to eighteen months 
as a result of the revised plan  the expected cost of closure is estimated to approximate million  requiring a reversal of million of the previous accrual 
the primary reasons for the significant reduction in the accrual were the passage of time of not closing stores earlier  many of the stores now will be closed at the end of their lease terms  and the shift in strategy in that only surfacing equipment would be removed from full service stores as opposed to the original plan of completely removing labs 
management believes it will be able to implement its revised plan based on the current status of lease termination negotiations and the expected installation of new lab systems  along with a new central lab facility in for the restructuring charges recorded in  and  approximately million represented non cash charges and million represented cash outlays through january   including a total of million that had been incurred and paid during the respective periods that each charge was initially recorded 
at january   approximately million of restructuring reserves remained  all of which is expected to result in cash outlays over the next twelve months for lease settlement  severance and other costs incurred in fiscal but paid in fiscal the unusual charges in fiscal related to the writeoff of million associated with the abandonment in the fourth quarter of previously capitalized system development costs including million of incurred costs that will be paid in the first half of fiscal and million primarily related to restricted stock issued to two senior executive officers 
cole national corporation also made an unconditional commitment in the fourth quarter of fiscal to contribute million through  with payments beginning in  to a leading medical institution supporting the development of a premier eye care research and surgical facility 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the restructuring  business integration and other unusual charges 
liquidity and capital resources cole national corporation s primary source of liquidity is funds provided from operations of its operating subsidiaries 
in addition  its wholly owned subsidiary  cole national group  inc and its operating subsidiaries have available to them working capital commitments of million  reduced by commitments under letters of credit  under a credit facility put in place at the time of the pearle acquisition 
there were no working capital borrowings outstanding as of january   and the maximum amount outstanding at any time during fiscal was million 
there were no working capital borrowings outstanding during fiscal the credit facility contains covenants restricting the ability of its operating subsidiaries to  among other things  pay dividends or make other restricted payments to cole national corporation or cole national group 
the credit facility permits cole national group s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the extent necessary to permit payment of all interest and principal on the notes and the notes when due 
during the second quarter of fiscal  cole national corporation completed a public offering of  shares of its common stock at an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used for general corporate purposes including reducing outstanding indebtedness and financing acquisitions  including the purchase of avc 
in august  cole national group issued million of notes 
the net proceeds of the issuance were million 
cole national group also commenced a tender offer which expired on september   to purchase up to all of its million outstanding senior notes at  per  principal amount  plus accrued interest thereon  using the net proceeds of the notes issuance and cash on hand 
a total of million of senior notes was tendered  with the remaining amount redeemed in october in november  the board of directors authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to million shares of common stock  or approximately of cole national corporation s outstanding shares  through open market or block transactions 
it is expected that the purchase price will be from internally generated funds and that the shares purchased will be used  in part  to offset dilution from stock options and in connection with other benefit plans 
during fiscal   shares of common stock were repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of january   cole national corporation had purchased a total of  shares of common stock  and has authority to purchase up to  shares of common stock in the open market and block purchases 
at year end  million of notes and million of notes were outstanding 
the notes and the notes are unsecured and mature december  and august   respectively  with no earlier scheduled redemption or sinking fund payment 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on each june and december  while the interest on the notes is payable semi annually on each february and august the indentures pursuant to which the notes and the notes were issued contain certain optional and mandatory redemption features and other financial covenants  including restrictions on the ability of cole national group to pay dividends or make other restricted payments to cole national corporation 
the indentures permit dividend payments equal to one half of cole national group s consolidated net income  provided that no default or event of default has occurred under the indentures and that cole national group has met a specified fixed charge coverage ratio test 
the indentures also permit payments to cole national corporation for certain tax obligations and for administrative expenses not to exceed 
of net sales 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
no significant principal payment obligations are due under its outstanding indebtedness until the notes mature in the ability of cole national corporation and its subsidiaries to satisfy these obligations will be primarily dependent upon future financial and operating performance of the subsidiaries and upon its ability to renew or refinance borrowings or to raise additional equity capital 
cash balances at year end were million compared to million at january  operations generated net cash of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary sources of the million improvement in cash provided from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal were from net income tax refunds received in fiscal of million compared to income taxes paid in fiscal of million  million from a decrease in accounts and notes receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets versus an increase last year and million from a smaller increase in inventories in fiscal  partially offset by a million larger decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million due in part to the payment of non recurring charges  an increase in inventories of million versus million in fiscal  and a decrease in accrued and deferred income taxes of million versus an increase of million in fiscal these cash flow decreases were partly offset by a million decrease in the net assets of discontinued operations  increased income from operations of million  excluding the charge for integration and other non recurring items  and increased depreciation and amortization expense of million 
net capital additions were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of the capital additions was for store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements for new stores and the remodeling of existing stores 
capital expenditures for fiscal include the purchase and furnishing of cole vision s headquarters office building for million 
in fiscal construction of a new warehouse and distribution facility for things remembered was completed at a cost of approximately million of which million is included in capital expenditures in fiscal 
in fiscal  proceeds of million were received from the sale and leaseback of this facility and a portion of the land 
in addition  the company used million for additional net investment in pearle europe in connection with pearle europe s acquisition in of the second largest optical retailer in germany and the largest optical retailer in austria 
the company also used million for several acquisitions of local optical chains in fiscal  million for the purchase of avc and million for additional investment in pearle europe in fiscal  and million for the purchases of pearle and aoco limited and million for the investment in pearle europe in fiscal in addition  cole national corporation paid approximately million and million for systems development costs in and  respectively 
such costs have been capitalized and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
for fiscal  management plans to expand the number of stores  as well as remodel and relocate stores  and currently estimates that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  excluding acquisitions and systems development costs 
management estimates that it will incur approximately million in systems development costs in that will be capitalized and subsequently amortized 
cole national corporation believes that funds provided from operations along with funds available under the credit facility will provide adequate sources of liquidity to allow its operating subsidiaries to continue to expand the number of stores and to fund capital expenditures and systems development costs 
year cole national corporation has been working with a consultant to assess and resolve the potential impact of the year on the ability of its computerized information systems to accurately process information that may be date sensitive the year readiness program 
any of the programs that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year could result in errors or system failures 
during fiscal  cole national corporation completed the assessment of its internal critical and non critical hardware and software 
included in the assessment was the identification of all critical and non critical computer programs and hardware  including non information technology systems such as hvac  telephone and others containing embedded microcontrollers  and an evaluation of their year readiness 
cole national corporation utilizes over separate computer information systems across its operations  many of which were recently installed and are year ready 
in addition  modifications to many other critical programs has been completed and testing of these programs is in process 
management currently believes that all critical programs and hardware will be year ready  including testing  by the end of the third quarter of fiscal concurrent with this internal assessment  cole national corporation identified and contacted critical vendors  host stores and managed health care partners with whom it does business regarding their year readiness 
although not all responses from third parties have been received  management is not currently aware of any critical third party whose year issues are likely to have a material effect on the company 
cole national corporation has not yet developed contingency plans and such plans will depend primarily on the responses from critical third parties in the event that it or critical third parties should fail to become year ready 
cole national corporation expects any necessary contingency plans to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal notwithstanding that cole national corporation is proceeding diligently with the implementation of its own year readiness program  including ascertaining year readiness of critical third parties  the inability of it or critical third parties to effectuate timely and cost effective solutions to year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company 
management estimates the total cost of the year readiness program will be approximately million  including approximately million of new hardware and software that will be capitalized 
the remaining million will be expensed as incurred approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal 
these costs include only external costs as internal costs  which consist primarily of payroll related costs of employees  are not tracked separately for the year readiness program 
the estimate of external costs does not include costs associated with addressing and resolving issues as a result of the failure of third parties to become year ready
