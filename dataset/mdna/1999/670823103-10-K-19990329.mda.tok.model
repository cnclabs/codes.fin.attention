item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general at december   we owned and operated o charley s restaurants in alabama  florida  georgia  indiana  kentucky  mississippi  north carolina  ohio  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
o charley s are full service  casual dining restaurants that appeal to traditional casual dining customers as well as value oriented customers by offering high quality food at moderate pricing with outstanding service 
our restaurants are open seven days a week  and most offer alcoholic beverages as well as food 
we expect to increase revenues by opening new units and by increasing same store sales 
our growth strategy is to continue fully penetrating existing and new targeted major metropolitan areas while opening new units in smaller secondary markets in close proximity to our major markets 
we operate a commissary for the primary purpose of providing our restaurants with consistent quality food products that meet our specifications while obtaining the best possible prices for those items 
the majority of the food products served in our restaurants are distributed to the stores by the commissary 
in addition to purchasing food and supply products  the commissary manufactures certain proprietary products and ages and cuts red meat into steaks in its usda approved meat facility 
all sales from the commissary to the restaurants are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table reflects changes in the number of company owned restaurants for the periods presented restaurants in operation  beginning of period restaurants opened restaurants acquired from franchisees restaurants closed in operation  end of period revenues consist of restaurant sales and to a lesser extent commissary sales 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes 
commissary sales represent sales to outside parties consisting primarily of sales of o charley s label food items  primarily salad dressings  to retail grocery chains  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
consistent with industry trends  liquor sales as a percentage of restaurant sales has declined in each of the last three fiscal years 
cost of food  beverage and supplies primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather  cause periodic fluctuations in food costs 
generally  temporary increases are absorbed and are not passed on to customers  however  we typically adjust menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries and bonuses  hourly wages for store level employees  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have an incentive bonus plan that compensates store management for achieving and exceeding certain store level financial targets and performance goals 
restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses and expenses  management training salaries  property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
restaurant operating margin is defined as restaurant sales less cost of restaurant sales 
cost of restaurant sales  for purposes of this discussion  consists of cost of food  beverage and supplies  payroll and benefits and restaurant operating costs 
advertising  general and administrative expenses include all advertising and home office administrative functions that support the existing restaurant base and provide the infrastructure for future growth 
advertising  executive management and support staff salaries  bonuses and related expenses  data processing  legal and accounting expenses and office expenses account for the major expenses in this category 
depreciation and amortization primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life and amortization of preopening costs for new restaurants  which includes costs of hiring and training the initial staff and certain other costs 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues may increase as the number of new store openings increases 
beginning in the first quarter of  preopening costs will be expensed as incurred in accordance with sop see new accounting pronouncement rather than amortized over one year 
this new accounting method affects when preopening costs are expensed and may impact earnings relative to the current method from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on when these costs are incurred 
we will continue to capture preopening costs  which will be recorded in a new line item category on the statement of operations 
the depreciation and amortization category  beginning in  will no longer include the amortization of preopening costs 
the following section should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere herein

as a percentage of commissary sales 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was attributable to the addition of new restaurants  an increase in same store sales of and the acquisition of our remaining franchisee s operations 
the increase in same store sales was the result of an increase in customer traffic of approximately and an increase in the average check of approximately  which was primarily the result of a menu price increase taken in march we believe the increase in customer traffic is partly the result of an increase  since the fourth quarter of  in the total marketing dollars expended as a percentage of sales 
additionally  we believe our growth strategy of opening several stores in existing major markets and back filling in secondary markets has contributed to an increase in consumer awareness in our markets 
cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of food  beverage and supplies remained at 
although the overall food cost percentage remained the same  there were some items that positively and negatively affected food cost 
our menu price increase in march and improved operating efficiencies lowered food cost as a percentage of sales 
these improvements were offset by cost increases in poultry  primarily chicken tenders  red meat  cheese and dairy products and potatoes 
except for those food items mentioned above  the impact of inflation on food cost was minimal 
currently  we expect nominal increases in the cost of food items in  however  there can be no assurance that events outside our control will not result in increased food costs 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in payroll and benefits as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in consistent with the previous year  we continued to achieve a lower payroll cost as a percentage of restaurant sales due to the economies achieved from higher average unit sales volumes  reduced management and hourly turnover and from certain reduced employee benefit cost reductions 
store level bonus increases and higher average wage rates partially offset the decreases in payroll and benefit costs 
our markets generally have low unemployment rates and we compete with other restaurants for employees 
we anticipate continued wage rate increases in restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  restaurant operating costs decreased to in from 
this decrease is primarily attributable to economies generated from higher average unit volumes and lower rent expense as we have generally purchased our restaurant sites in recent years 
decreases in the restaurant operating cost percentage were partially offset by higher bonuses earned by supervisor and regional level management and by increases in training expenses for store management 
each of the supervisors and regional managers participate in an incentive based compensation plan tied directly to their financial results and performance goals 
we increased management training in to prepare for the additional units expected to open in including stores in two new geographical markets  charlotte  north carolina  and columbus  ohio 
typically  we incur higher initial supervision and other operating costs when entering new markets 
we did not enter any new major market in restaurant operating margin increased to million in from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  restaurant operating margin improved to in from in this improvement is due to the increase in overall average sales and decreases in payroll and benefit cost and other restaurant operating costs as a percentage of sales 
advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of total revenue  advertising  general and administrative expenses decreased to from 
advertising expenditures increased to million in from million in and  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in depreciation and amortization in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of total revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to in from in amortization of preopening expenses remained at of total revenue in while depreciation expense increased to of total revenue in from in the increase in depreciation expense is primarily attributable to additional capital expenditures for the remodeling of certain existing stores 
see new accounting pronouncement for changes in the reporting of preopening costs  beginning in the first quarter of income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in after adjusting for the interest expense reduction in  earnings before income taxes increased million  or  to million from million in interest expense  net decreased  in to million from million in we reduced our long term debt by approximately million in the fourth quarter of from the net proceeds received from the sale of common stock that reduced interest expense in income tax expense increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  income tax expense was in versus in this reduction is primarily attributable to an overall lower state income tax expense in fiscal year compared with fiscal year total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in primarily as a result of an increase in restaurant sales of million  or  and an increase in commissary sales of  or 
the increase in restaurant sales was primarily attributable to the addition of restaurants in and an increase in same store sales of 
the increase in same store sales resulted from an increase in customer traffic and menu price increases 
we attribute the increase in customer traffic to the introduction of a redesigned menu  a new advertising campaign  increased promotional items  improved restaurant operations and milder weather in our markets during the first quarter of compared with we initiated a new advertising campaign beginning in the fourth quarter of that continued through this new advertising effort focused on our defining differences and in some cases highlighted certain promotional items 
menu price increases were instituted during the first and third quarters of which realized approximately 
liquor sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in reflecting industry trends 
cost of food  beverage and supplies in increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
cost of food  beverage and supplies as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to cost reductions in certain high volume food commodities  increased operating efficiencies at our commissary and overall lower produce costs due primarily to lower potato costs 
our redesigned menu and seasonal promotions also contributed to lower food cost by offering a mix of menu items competitively priced that produced a lower food cost percentage while enhancing our quality standards 
overall  the impact of inflation on food cost was minimal 
payroll and benefits increased million  or  to million in from million in the prior year 
payroll and benefits as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in we achieved a lower percentage of payroll and benefit costs due primarily to the economies achieved from higher average unit sales volumes  reduced management and hourly turnover and from certain employee benefit cost reductions 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in restaurant management bonus expense and wage rates 
bonus expense increased due to a larger percentage of stores meeting and exceeding their financial targets and performance goals in compared with as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which o charley s restaurants are located  we continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management and hourly coworkers 
restaurant operating costs in increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
restaurant operating costs as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to the allocation of certain supervisory and overhead costs over a greater number of restaurants and economies achieved from higher average unit sales 
since january  we have generally opened new stores in existing geographical markets  which has contributed to a slower growth rate in certain expenses  particularly supervisory costs 
additionally  rent expense  as a percentage of restaurant sales  was lower as we continued to purchase most of our restaurant sites 
these decreases in the restaurant operating percentage were partially offset by an increase in the amount of bonus expense earned by supervisory management 
bonus expense increased due to the improved financial and performance results in restaurant operating margin increased to million in from million in as a percentage of restaurant sales  the restaurant operating margin increased to in from in this improvement was primarily attributable to the leverage achieved from overall higher average unit volumes and lower food cost 
advertising  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the prior year 
advertising  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in advertising expenditures and bonus expense for home office management 
we introduced a television and radio advertising campaign in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the introduction of a redesigned menu 
these advertising expenses increased to of restaurant sales in compared with approximately in bonus expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in the bonus compensation of senior management and executive officers that is based in part on a formula that rewards increased profits 
depreciation and amortization in increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase is primarily due to our additional capital expenditures for the remodeling of certain existing stores and the relocation of two stores 
a million charge relating to the revaluation of certain assets was recorded in pursuant to the provisions of fas during  we identified certain restaurant units for possible impairment 
once identified  we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows for each unit and determined that for each unit the asset s net book value exceeded its related undiscounted cash flows  and as a result  we recognized asset write downs 
see note of notes to our financial statements 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of the million charge in for assets impaired under fas excluding the million charge in  income from operations in would have been million and the increase in would have been million  or  over income from operations as a percentage of total revenues  excluding the fas charge in  would have increased from in to in this increase was primarily a result of an improved restaurant operating margin  which was partially offset by increased general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses 
interest expense  net increased  or  to million in from million in this increase in interest expense was primarily the result of increased average borrowings under the revolving line of credit and capitalized lease obligations to fund our growth 
we reduced our long term debt by approximately million in the fourth quarter of from net proceeds received from the sale of common stock 
litigation expense of million in represented expenses relating to the settlement of a two year old class action discrimination lawsuit against the company 
income tax expense was million in compared with income tax benefit of  in the prior year 
income tax expense benefit as a percentage of earnings loss before income taxes for was compared with in the income tax benefit in was higher than the expected rate because of the amount of the federal insurance contribution act tip credits in relation to a lower taxable income 
earnings loss before income taxes was million in versus a million loss in excluding the asset revaluation and litigation charges in  earnings before income taxes in would have been million  which represents an increase of million  or in liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been generated from cash provided by operations  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and additions to capitalized lease obligations 
our principal capital needs arise primarily from the purchase and development of new restaurants  equipment replacement and improvements to existing restaurants 
property and equipment additions of million in  including million financed by capitalized lease obligations  were incurred primarily for the development of new restaurants and improvements to existing restaurants 
additionally  we repaid million  net  in principal on our long term debt and capitalized lease obligations and incurred other investment expenditures of million 
these cash outlays were funded primarily by million in cash provided by operations  net borrowings of million under our revolving credit agreement the revolver  borrowings of approximately million under capitalized lease obligations  approximately million in proceeds from the sale and involuntary conversion of certain assets and approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options 
the above sources and uses of cash increased cash by million in we believe we will need additional capital of approximately million to million in to fund capital expenditures for the planned to new restaurants and for improvements to existing units 
as of december   we had nine restaurants under construction  six to seven of which are expected to open during the first quarter of in addition  we have plans for several new capital projects in  including an expected million for a new freezer and the possible purchase of the existing commissary and home office land and building facilities which are currently under an operating lease 
the purchase of the commissary and home office facilities is currently being considered 
if purchased  we estimate the cost to be approximately to million  however  we do have the option to continue leasing these facilities 
financing to fund these projects is currently being evaluated and may include borrowings under the revolver and or off balance sheet financing 
actual capital expenditures in may vary from the above estimate based on a number of factors  including the timing of additional purchases of future restaurant sites 
we intend to continue financing the furniture  fixtures and equipment for our new stores with capitalized lease obligations 
the revolver provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolver and bore interest at an average rate of 
the maturity date on million of the revolver is november   while the remaining million matures on december  the maturities may be extended annually by one year  at the participating banks option  beginning on each of the anniversaries of the revolver 
the revolver imposes restrictions on us with respect to the maintenance of certain financial ratios  the incurrence of indebtedness  the sale of assets  mergers and the payment of dividends 
our working capital historically has had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to cash reinvestments in long term assets  mostly property and equipment additions 
at december   the working capital deficiency and the current ratio were million and to  respectively 
on september   the board of directors of the company approved the repurchase of up to of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   approximately  shares had been repurchased 
while we do not anticipate repurchasing any additional shares at this time  we continually evaluate the best uses of our capital and may repurchase additional shares in the future 
during  we believe that available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowings under the revolver and capitalized lease obligations will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital outlays 
new accounting pronouncement in december  the aicpa accounting standards executive committee acsec approved for issuance the statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this sop is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the sop requires that costs incurred during a start up activity be expensed as incurred 
currently  we capitalize our preopening costs and amortize these costs over a month period 
at december   we had million in unamortized preopening costs 
we will recognize in the first quarter of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a charge equal to the after tax effect of these unamortized preopening costs 
thereafter  preopening costs will be expensed as incurred 
the adoption of the sop will not impact cash flows from operations 
year a business issue exists with regard to existing software applications and the ability of these applications to process date values 
specifically  many computer applications are written in two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
beginning in the year  these applications will need to be capable of recognizing four digit dates in order to properly distinguish the year from prior periods 
we are considering the impact of the year issues on our business and operations  and we have a remediation plan 
we have completed testing of our information technology it systems  and we are compliant 
we are currently testing our non it systems and anticipate completing such testing by june  we are currently making inquiries to our suppliers and other third party entities with which we have business relations as to their own year issues 
we expect to complete such inquiries by june  we are in the process of developing contingency plans to be implemented in the event any it system  non it system  third party or supplier is not year compliant by january  we expense all costs associated with system changes as the costs are incurred 
a significant portion of our year related costs are already included in our software support agreements  therefore  we do not believe the year issues will have a significant impact on our operations or liquidity 
however  the malfunction or complete failure of our systems would likely have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
should the remaining review of our year risks reveal potentially non compliant systems or material third party risks  contingency plans will be developed to address the deficiencies revealed at that time 
our statements regarding year issues are dependent on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on our operations  liquidity or financial condition 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land and construction costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly coworkers 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
we may attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at existing restaurants
