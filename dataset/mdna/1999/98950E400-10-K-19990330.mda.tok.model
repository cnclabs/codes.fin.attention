item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general zevex international  inc  hereafter azevex international is in the business of designing and manufacturing advanced medical and electronic devices  including surgical systems  device components  and sensors for medical technology and other companies 
zevex international also designs  manufactures  and markets its own medical devices and musculoskelatal evaluation products using its proprietary technologies 
zevex international conducts its business primarily through its oringinal wholly owned subsidiary  zevex  inc  a delaware corporation zevex inc  and two newly acquired  wholly owned subsidiaries  jtech medical technologies  inc  a utah corporation jtech  and aborn electronics  inc  a california corporation aborn 
zevex inc designs and manufactures medical devices for medical technology companies  as well as for itself 
jtech manufactures and markets its own proprietary musculoskeletal evaluation products for health care providers 
aborn designs and manufactures a variety of sophisticated optical sensors and custom computer chips for medical technology and other companies 
developments during zevex international substantially expanded its business during  diversifying zevex international s offering of proprietary products and its ability to design and manufacture sophisticated devices for other companies 
company management believes that this expansion fulfills a major part of the company s plans for growth through acquisition 
the expansion took place in three major steps in july  zevex inc entered into an agreement with nutrition medical  inc  a minnesota corporation nutrition medical  to acquire nutrition medical s enteral feeding line of products 
enteral feeding involves patient feeding through feeding pumps  delivery sets  and feeding tubes through the intestines or stomach 
company management believes that the addition of the nutrition medical product line greatly complement zevex inc s existing line of enteral feeding products  enhancing the company s ability to serve the enteral feeding markets 
from july to december  zevex inc marketed the nutrition medical products under an exclusive marketing arrangement  under that agreement  the company sold the nutrition medical line  but at a lower margin than the company normally receives for its proprietary products 
on december   the company acquired jtech through a stock purchase transaction with the four shareholders of jtech 
jtech was organized in as a sole proprietorship and later incorporated as jtech medical industries  inc in to initially manufacture and sell range of motion measurement devices 
as mentioned above  jtech currently manufactures and markets its own proprietary musculoskeletal evaluation products for health care providers  a line of products not previously made or sold by zevex inc with approximately employees  jtech s gross revenues for were  the company anticipates a significant contribution to revenues from jtech in on december   the company acquired aborn through a stock purchase transaction with the sole shareholder of aborn 
aborn was organized in to initially design  manufacture and sell low cost commercial fiber optic components 
as mentioned above  aborn currently designs and manufactures a variety of sophisticated optical sensors  custom computer chips and semiconductor components for medical technology and other companies  bringing new design and manufacturing expertise to the company 
with approximately employees  aborn s gross revenues for calendar were  the company anticipates a significant contribution to revenues from aborn in because the acquisition of aborn and jtech occurred at year end  the contribution of these acquisitions to the financial performance of the company will not be realized until zevex s sales results for were the strongest in the company s history 
revenues were  a increase over revenues of  in  and a increase over revenues of  in revenues for increased primarily due to demand for the company s proprietary products  and the award of significant engineering and manufacturing service contracts 
results of operations in each of the three preceding years  a small number of customers accounted for a significant percentage of total revenues 
fluctuations in the timing and size of orders from such major customers resulted in changes in the company s revenues and product mix  which in turn affected gross margins 
as a result  the company experienced variations in operating results from quarter to quarter  and the results of operations for a specific quarter should not be considered indicative of the results that may be achieved for longer periods 
manufacturing revenue growth depends upon growth in demand for systems  devices and instruments manufactured by the company  as well as on the company s ability to acquire additional manufacturing service contracts from medical technology companies 
the company s contract manufacturing customers have complete control over the marketing and sales of products that the company manufacture s for them 
the company has no ability to increase demand for instruments that it manufactures for its contract manufacturing customers 
the company markets its manufacturing capabilities and rarely undertakes design work without securing exclusive manufacturing rights see amanufacturing capabilities 
the volume and timing of future manufacturing revenues related to any specific engineering project are highly variable 
certain engineering projects may not lead to future manufacturing revenues 
the manufacturing gross margin percentage from year to year depends primarily on the product mix  as gross margins vary by instrument and as a result of negotiated volume discounts 
management may negotiate volume discounts if the larger volume results in smaller per unit overhead  improving operating margin 
the gross margin percentage for manufacturing revenues from instruments not yet approved for commercial use is generally lower because a smaller number of units produced limits opportunities to achieve economies of scale and the instrument and its manufacturing process are being refined  resulting in larger per unit costs during the initial manufacturing phase 
the company s annual and quarterly operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the volume and timing of customer orders  which vary due to i variation in demand for the customer s products as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions  ii the customer s attempt to balance its inventory  iii the customer s need to adapt to changing regulatory conditions and requirements  and iv changes in the customer s manufacturing strategy 
technical difficulties and delays in the design and manufacturing processes may also affect such results 
the foregoing factors may cause fluctuations in revenues and variations in product mix  which could in turn cause fluctuations in the company s gross margin 
during the first quarter of  the company is continuing to work on a contract with a certain customer on a fixed price contract  which may have an adverse impact on the company s gross margin 
the company also is completing a reengineering project with a major customer on a cost sharing basis which may adversely affect gross margin 
the company is in the process of increasing prices of the products that it acquired in the nutrition medical acquisition which the company completed on december   in an effort to improve gross margins on the nutrition medical line in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain items in the income statement bear to revenues 
year ended december  income statement data percentage of gross sales revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income loss other income income loss before taxes provisions benefit for taxes net income loss during  of total revenues resulted from sales to three customers  all of whom were major customers in during and  and of total revenues resulted from sales to four customers and three customers  respectively  three of which were major customers in both years 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  as compared to in and in management attributes the decrease in to the following factors the rapid increase in sales of the enteralite feeding pump in the second quarter exceeded the production capacity of zevex s outside supplier of disposable sets  which resulted in a surge in the cost of sales related to this product due to increased shipping and related expenses necessary to maintain the company s obligations to its customers and reputation for service  delays experienced in the delivery schedules dictated by three of the company s major customers  where the company normally experiences a higher gross margin  increased costs of engineering staff to execute new engineering and production jobs obtained by the company during the second and third quarters  recorded revenue related to the nutrition medical product acquisition on which the company did not realize any gross profit and small gross margin related to products sold under the marketing agreement with nutrition medical  costs associated with the reengineering project to enhance the marketability of a customer product on a cost sharing basis  and a shift in the revenue mix of the company s products to lower margin items 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during to  of gross sales  as compared to  of gross sales in  and  of gross sales in increased expenses resulted from the company s continuing growth as it established marketing channels for proprietary products 
the company incurred one time expense related to its application and listing on the nasdaq national market  as well as increased costs associated with legal  accounting  general consulting and public and investor relations  depreciation and general administration 
expanded sales and marketing efforts increased staffing  travel  advertising  and administrative expenses related to the company s proprietary clinical nutrition delivery product line 
the company also had an increase in expenses related to employees  such as insurance  taxes  and pension benefits 
the company believes that general and administrative expenses in as related to sales will continue at approximately the same percentage rate as averaged over the last three years 
as of december   zevex inc had three full time engineers in research and development  and had several other designers and engineers contributing to additional research and development projects 
zevex inc s research and development projects are primarily focused on new proprietary products 
during the last three fiscal years  zevex inc continued independent research and development activities with respect to the design and development of new and improved devices  spending  in   in  and  in in and  research and development costs represented approximately and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the most notable product from the company s research and development efforts during the past two years is the enteralite ambulatory enteral feeding pump 
significant fluctuations experienced in research and development are due to timing of the company s research projects 
the company expects research and developments costs in to be approximately of revenues 
operating income decreased to  of gross sales in from  of gross sales in  and  of gross sales in similarly  the company had a net income of  of gross sales in  compared to  of gross sales in  and  of gross sales in these changes during as compared to and are principally due to the costs addressed above in relation to cost of sales and selling  general and administrative costs as well as changes in the company s product mix of lower margin items delivered during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s increased working capital requirements during stemmed from increasing accounts receivable and inventory levels associated with growth in revenues and the company s efforts to expand its operations by acquisitions of products and technologies 
prior to  working capital had been funded primarily by a combination of increased accounts payable  borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit  and a million private placement of the zevex international s common stock and warrants in february  in november  the zevex international completed a secondary public offering of the zevex international s common stock  from which the zevex international received approximately million in net proceeds

the company s purchases of land  leasehold improvements to its facilities  and new research  production  testing equipment  and tooling totaled  in  as compared to  in  and  in the amount spent during is primarily attributed to the company s purchase of approximately acres of land adjacent to the company s current facility in salt lake city in march  as well as to continued upgrading of the company s production fixturing  tooling and research and engineering capabilities 
the increase in equipment purchases between and is primarily due to upgrading the company s production fixturing  tooling and research and engineering capabilities 
the company s working capital at december   was  compared to  at december   and  at december  the portion of working capital represented by cash and short term investments at such dates was   and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital during is primarily attributed to i the acquisitions of the product line from nutrition medical and the stock purchases of jtech and aborn  ii increases in accounts and accrued payables  and iii an increase of the company s line of credit 
in  the increase in working capital was primarily attributed to i completion of a secondary offering of the company s common stock in november   of approximately million  ii increased income from operations during the year  and iii a private placement that was completed in february  in  the company used net cash flow of  in operating activities  as the company funded an increase in accounts receivable and inventories

year compliance many existing computer programs  worldwide  use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
such computer programs may not properly recognize a year beginning with instead of the current 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create incorrect results 
this phenomena is often referred to as the year or yk problem 
there is substantial concern that if the year problem is not adequately addressed  there may be widespread problems with computer applications in all areas of use  potentially affecting the global economy 
if the company s internal systems and products do not correctly recognize date information when the year changes to  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
additionally  if the company s supplier  customers  and other parties experience yk difficulties  the company could be adversely affected 
the company is continuing the process of assessing and correcting potential year problems with the company s operations 
state of readiness with regard to its information systems financial  supply  inventory  order  office support  etc 
the company has developed and begun implementing a plan to convert all necessary systems to be ready for the year approximately of the necessary systems have been determined to be yk compliant by the company  or have been upgraded to new systems which are certified by the manufacturer as year compliant 
completion of correction or upgrading of the remaining necessary systems is expected by july  with regard to its non information system operations  the company is in the process of reviewing and correcting yk problems in the following areas products currently manufactured by the company  manufacturing and engineering systems  and building systems 
this review is approximately complete and the company has been able to correct or plans to correct prior to each material yk issue identified in the review 
with regard to potential yk issues for the company s major material suppliers  the company is in the process of communicating with such parties 
although not all major suppliers have indicated their yk compliance  the company has not yet identified any major supplier that believes it will be unable to operate due to yk problems in generally  the company has alternative sources for supplies in the event a supplier experiences such difficulties and the company does not presently anticipate material difficulties in obtaining materials due to suppliers yk problems 
with regard to major customers  the company has had communications with such parties and is reviewing responses regarding the companies yk compliance 
to date  the company has insufficient information from such parties to determine the potential impact on the company if such parties experience yk difficulties 
with regard to third party utilities and services for example  telephone electrical  bankcard processing and shipping services  the company has no plans to evaluate the yk readiness of such providers 
cost to address yk issues as of march   the company has spent approximately  in hardware and software expenses to upgrade or correct yk problems with the company s internal systems 
the company currently expects to incur approximately an additional  in costs for further upgrades and corrections 
these costs include  however  costs to upgrade and replace systems that the company would otherwise would have done in the normal course of business 
the estimated costs are based on management s best projections but there can be no guarantee that these forecasts will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
company management anticipates that these costs will be funded through operating cash flows 
the company has not yet been able to estimate the costs it may incur as a result of its suppliers and customers experiencing yk difficulties 
risk of the company s yk issues the company anticipates that the material risks related to its information and non information systems will be timely mitigated by current efforts being made by the company to identify and correct internal yk problems 
however  there is no guarantee that the company will successfully identify or correct all yk problems in a timely manner 
for example  due to the inherent limitations of real time clock devices and system bios in the company s manufacturing equipment or building systems  continued review and testing could uncover additional problems 
in some cases  problems may be unforeseen  and occur regardless of the testing and review that is done 
other major yk risks for the company arise from the potential for major customers to experience financial or operational difficulties resulting from yk problems 
if such customers reduce their orders for the company s products or services  the company s operations could be adversely affected 
additionally  a major potential yk risk to the company s operations is service disruption from third party providers that supply telephone  electrical  banking and shipping services 
any disruption of these critical services would hinder the company s ability to receive  process and ship orders
