in addition  the company had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility at december  the credit facility  the million of senior notes due in and the million of senior subordinated notes due in  set forth a number of affirmative  negative  and financial covenants binding on the company 
the negative covenants limit the ability of the company to  among other things  incur debt  incur liens  make investments  make dividend or other distributions  or enter into any merger or other consolidation transaction 
the financial covenants include the maintenance of a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  compliance with a leverage ratio and a coverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures 
the company s obligations under the senior notes due in are guaranteed by substantially all of the subsidiaries of the company the guarantors 
separate financial statements of the guarantors are not provided herein as i the guarantors are jointly and severally liable for the company s obligations under the notes  ii the subsidiaries which are not guarantors are inconsequential to the consolidated operations of the company and its subsidiaries  and iii the net assets and earnings of the guarantors are substantially equivalent to the net assets and earnings of the consolidated entity as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements

disclosures about market risks the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in short term investment prices  interest rates  fuel prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
short term investments the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in the company s investment policy guidelines 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
short term investments at december   which are recorded at fair value of million  have exposure to price risk 
this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted prices and amounts to million 
interest rates the company primarily issues long term debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the majority of the company s long term debt obligations bear a fixed rate of interest 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates affecting the company s floating rate long term debt would reduce pre tax income by million over the next fiscal year 
a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt 
fuel prices the company is dependent on diesel fuel to operate its fleet of rigs 
diesel fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  government policies  changes in global demand  and global production 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company generally follows a policy of hedging a portion of its anticipated diesel fuel consumption 
the instruments used are principally readily marketable exchange traded futures contracts which are designated as hedges 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes of diesel fuel 
gains and losses resulting from fuel hedging transactions are recognized when the underlying fuel being hedged is used 
a increase in diesel fuel prices would reduce pre tax income by million over the next fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange rates although the majority of the company s operations are in the united states  the company does have foreign subsidiaries primarily canada 
the net investments in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using year end exchange rates at december   is million 
the potential loss in fair value impacting other comprehensive income resulting from a hypothetical change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
year year yk issues are being addressed by the company 
the company  like most other major companies  is currently addressing a universal problem commonly referred to as year compliance  which relates to the ability of computer programs and systems to properly recognize and process date sensitive information before and after january  the following discussion is based on information currently available to the company 
the company has analyzed and continues to analyze its internal information technology it systems it systems to identify any computer programs that are not year compliant and implement any changes required to make such systems year compliant 
the company believes that its critical it systems currently are capable of functioning without substantial year compliance problems 
of the non critical  but important  it systems that are not currently year compliant  the company believes such it systems will be year capable in a time frame that will avoid any material adverse effect on the company 
also  the company does not believe that the expenditures related to replacing or upgrading any of its it systems to make them year compliant will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company has evaluated its critical equipment and critical systems that contain embedded software  non it systems  and the company believes that all of its critical non it systems are capable of functioning without substantial year compliance problems 
the company has engaged a leading computer consulting services firm to lead the year remediation and testing process 
the company is also investigating each of its significant vendors  suppliers  financial service organizations  service providers and customers to confirm that the company s operations will not be materially adversely affected by the failure of any such third party to have year compliant computer programs 
regardless of the responses that the company receives from such third parties  the company is establishing contingency plans to reduce the company s exposure resulting from the non compliance of third parties 
the company has approached the year project in phases 
phase i of the project involved identification of all software used by the company  identification of all significant vendors  and establishment of a senior management committee to oversee the project 
phase i was completed in the third calendar quarter of phase ii of the project involves a evaluation of each significant vendor and evaluation of major customers through letters and questionnaires b communication with customers concerning any products currently or recently sold by the company that have year issues  and c evaluating the company s most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios and contingency planning related thereto 
phase ii is in process and many of the tasks described in subparagraphs b and c above have been completed  phase ii is expected to be completed in the first calendar quarter of phase iii involves testing of the company s it systems and non it systems to confirm year compliance and or discover any overlooked year problems 
phase iii has commenced and should be completed in the third calendar quarter of last  phase iv involves implementation of the company s contingency plans 
such plans are expected to be implemented in the third calendar quarter of the company has material relationships with third parties whose failure to be year compliant could have materially adverse impacts on the company s business  operations or financial condition in the future 
third parties that are considered to be in this category for yk purposes include critically important customers  suppliers  vendors and public entities such as government regulatory agencies  utilities  financial entities and others 
the company derives most of its net operating revenues from the transportation of new and used automobiles and light trucks for all major domestic and foreign automotive manufacturers 
the company has made yk awareness information available to all customers and has asked each customer to advise the company of their plans for reaching yk readiness 
the company has also contacted the customers to inquire about actions being taken with respect to third parties 
further action may be taken by the company as it deems appropriate in particular cases 
the company classifies as critical those suppliers of products or services that  if interrupted  would materially disrupt the company s ability to conduct operations 
the company expect reviews of these products and service providers to be completed by the second quarter of in the first calendar quarter of  the company began the planning and implementation of a yk program involving interaction with and assessment of public entities such as government regulatory agencies  utilities  financial entities and others 
the company is preparing contingency plans relating specifically to identified yk risks  and cost estimates relating to these plans are being developed 
the company began training designated employees in yk contingency planning matters during the first calendar quarter of  and anticipates completion of the yk contingency plans during the third calendar quarter of contingency plans may include establishing alternative means of communicating with employees at terminal locations and with customers  and other appropriate measures 
once developed  yk contingency plans and related cost estimates will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
while the company currently believes that it will be able to modify or replace its affected systems in time to minimize any significant detrimental effects on its operations  failure to do so  or the failure of customers or other third parties to modify or replace their affected systems  could have materially adverse impacts on the company s business  operations or financial condition in the future 
there can be no guarantee that such impacts will not occur 
in particular  because of the interdependent nature of business systems  the company could be materially adversely affected if private businesses  utilities and governmental entities with which it does business or that provide essential products or services are not year compliant 
reasonably likely consequences of failure by the company or third parties to resolve the yk problem include  among other things  temporary slowdowns or cessation s of delivery operations at one or more company terminals  or delays in the delivery of vehicles 
however  the company believes that its yk readiness program  including related contingency planning  should significantly reduce the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations 
as of february   the company s total incremental costs historical plus estimated future costs of addressing yk issues are estimated to be in the range of million  of which approximately million has been incurred 
the company believes that approximately of the costs expected to be incurred in will be internal costs  including compensation and benefits of employees assigned primarily to yk procedures 
internal costs addressing yk issues during were not material 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flow 
these amounts do not include i any costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans  which are in the process of being developed  or ii costs associated with replacements of computerized systems or equipment in cases where replacement was not accelerated due to yk issues 
implementation of the company s yk plan is an ongoing process 
consequently  the above described estimates of costs and completion dates for the various components of the plan are subject to change 
the preceding discussion on yk contains various forward looking statements which represent the company s beliefs or expectations regarding future events 
when used in the yk discussion  the words believes  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  the company s expectations as to when it will complete the remediation and testing phases of its yk procedures as well as its yk contingency plans  its estimated cost of achieving yk readiness  and the company s belief that its internal systems and equipment will be year ready in a timely manner 
all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results 
factors that may cause these differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  and the actions of governmental agencies or other third parties with respect to yk problems 
the company does not currently believe that any of the foregoing will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or its results of operations 
however  the process of evaluating the company s third party vendors and their systems is ongoing 
although not expected  failures of critical suppliers  critical customers  critical it systems or critical non it systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as widely publicized  year compliance has many issues and aspects  not all of which the company is able to accurately forecast or predict 
there is no way to assure that year compliance will not have adverse effects on the company  some of which could be material 
seasonality and inflation the company generally experiences its highest revenues and earnings during the second and fourth quarters of each calendar year due to the shipment of new vehicle models and because the first and third quarters are impacted by manufacturing plant downtime 
during the past three years  inflation has not significantly affected the company s results of operations
