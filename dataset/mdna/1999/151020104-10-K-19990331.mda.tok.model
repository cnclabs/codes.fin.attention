item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the progenitor to celgene was organized in as a unit of celanese corporation  a major chemical company 
celgene s initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals 
following the merger of celanese corporation with american hoechst corporation  celgene was spun out as a separate company 
in  celgene completed an initial public offering of its common stock  and commenced the development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry 
celgene discontinued the biotreatment operations in to focus on its targeted small molecule immunotherapeutic compound development and biocatalytic chiral chemistry synthesis platforms 
since  the company s revenues have been generated primarily through the research and development relating to  and supply of  chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and  to a lesser degree  from agrochemical research and development contracts 
however  as the company developed its immunotherapeutic program  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of the company s strategic focus 
accordingly  on january  the company completed the sale of its chiral intermediate business to cambrex corporation for million 
the terms provided for a payment of million at closing and the present value equivalent of million in future royalties  with certain minimum royalty payments in the third through the sixth years after closing 
in late september   the company  after receiving final fda approval  commenced sales of its first commercial product  thalomid thalidomide 
the company has sustained losses in each year since its incorporation in in  the company had a loss from continuing operations of million  and at december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company expects to make substantial expenditures to further its immunotherapeutic program  to commercialize thalomid and to expand the chiral crop protection business  and  based on these expenditures  it is likely that losses will continue for at least the next months 
subject to the risks described elsewhere in this annual report the company believes that there are significant market opportunities for the products and processes under development by the company 
to address these opportunities in a timely and effective manner  the company intends to seek out collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties 
the company has entered into agreements covering the manufacture and distribution for the company of certain compounds  such as thalomid  and research and development by the company covering processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers 
celgene has established a sales and marketing organization to commercialize thalomid and currently employs persons in this capacity 
the company intends to develop and market its own pharmaceuticals for indications with smaller patient populations 
for drugs with indications for larger patient populations  the company anticipates partnering with other pharmaceutical companies 
the company also anticipates partnering with companies for the development and commercialization of the company s chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products 
celgene expects that these arrangements typically will include milestone payments  reimbursement of research and development expenses and royalty arrangements 
future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for the company s products  regulatory approvals  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by the company or competing companies  partner support payments  the company s ability to control costs  and its ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenues 
total revenues increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this was due to product sales of approximately million of thalomid which  as noted  was approved in by the fda and a decrease in research contracts of approximately 
million due to completion of a contract at the end of with a major agrochemical company 
the company s revenues for represented an increase of over revenues of approximately  revenues were primarily from product sales in and research contracts for the years and cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in was approximately  and relates to thalomid  the company s first commercial product  launched in late september the cost of goods sold is lower than expected as raw material  formulation and encapsulation costs of the product were expensed as research and development cost prior to receiving fda approval 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was due to an increase of approximately million for the company s chiral pharmaceutical program primarily for clinical trials and preclinical toxicology studies and approximately  due to the company s immunotherapeutic program  primarily clinical trials for potential new nda filings for thalomid 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increase was due to an increase of approximately  of expenses associated with the company s chiral pharmaceutical program primarily in clinical trials and million of expenses associated with the company s celgro subsidiary 
the increase in expenses for celgro was primarily facility and personnel charges related to establishing a separate location for the chiral agrochemical business 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this was primarily due to sales and marketing expenses  million  in anticipation of the thalomid product launch as well as post launch selling activities 
other increases were related to the necessary infrastructure costs required to support the commercial operations including medical affairs and drug safety costs of  information systems development cost and additional finance personnel   and other administrative expenses such as legal  consulting and investor relations of approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this was primarily due to the formation of a sales and marketing organization in anticipation of the thalomid product launch as well as an increase in certain support functions resulting from the anticipated transition to a commercial operation 
major increases were as follows sales and marketing expenses of million for sales force recruiting and training and other pre launch expenses  medical affairs and safety costs of  additional finance personnel and information systems development costs of  executive and administrative costs for the new celgro subsidiary of  and other administrative expenses such as legal  consulting and investor relations of approximately  interest income and interest expense 
interest income for increased by to approximately  from approximately  in the increase was due to higher average cash balances in interest income for decreased by from approximately million in this decrease was attributable to lower average cash balances in interest expense for increased to approximately  from  due primarily to the interest expenses associated with the convertible note issued in september interest expense in decreased from approximately  in the decrease was due to the conversion to equity of the convertible debentures issued in loss from continuing operations 
the loss from continuing operations increased to approximately million from approximately million in the increase was due primarily to spending related to the launch of thalomid and ongoing research programs in chiral pharmaceuticals and immunotherapeutics as described above 
the net loss from continuing operations for increased by from approximately million in reflecting increased spending in immunotherapeutics  the start of a thalomid marketing organization and the start of the chiral pharmaceutical development program 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations decreased to  in from  in due to the fact that the chiral intermediate business was sold in early january the company recorded a gain on the sale of the chiral intermediate assets of approximately million 
the loss from discontinued operations decreased by in from  in the reduced loss was primarily a result of an increase in revenues from million in to million in liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company has financed its working capital requirements primarily through private and public sales of its debt and equity securities  income earned on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of such securities  and revenues from research contracts and product sales 
the company has raised approximately million in net proceeds from three public and three private offerings  including its initial public offering in july in july  the company issued and sold in a private placement offering million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures due july  for total net proceeds  after offering costs  of approximately million 
as of december   all of the convertible debentures had been converted into common stock 
in march  the company issued and sold in a private placement offering shares of series a convertible preferred stock at  per share  for total gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds  after offering costs  of approximately million 
as of december  all shares had been converted to common stock 
in september  the company issued a convertible note in the amount of million to an institutional investor 
the note has a five year term and a coupon rate of with interest payable on a semi annual basis 
the debt contains a conversion feature that allows the note holder to convert the debt into common shares after one year at per share  a premium to the market price at closing 
the company s net working capital at december  decreased by to approximately million primarily cash and cash equivalents from approximately million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the increased rate of spending as previously discussed 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in while marketable securities increased by million from this reflects the receipt in december of funds from public offering of company common stock  which were not yet invested in marketable securities and the higher rate of spending in current research commitments for are approximately  primarily to rockefeller university  and glasgow university 
in addition a contract with boston university entered into in for the prescription monitoring program associated with the sales of thalomid was renewed for the commitment for is million 
the company expects that its rate of spending will increase as the result of increased clinical trial costs and expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products now in development and increased commercial costs related to the launch of thalomid tm thalidomide 
in order to assure funding for the company s future operations  the company is likely to seek additional capital resources 
however  no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in raising additional capital 
if the company is unable to raise additional funds  the company believes that its current financial resources including the proceeds of million from the convertible note issued in january as well as revenues from the sales of thalomid could fund operations based on budgeted levels of research and development  sales and marketing  and administrative activities through as of december   the company had for federal income tax purposes a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million 
if not utilized to offset future taxable income  such loss carryforward will expire between and certain events  including any sales by the company of shares of its stock and or transfers of a substantial number of shares of common stock by the current stockholders  may restrict the ability of the company to utilize its net operating loss carryforward 
year computer systems compliance many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year yk to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  those programs could cause date related transaction failures 
the company s chief information officer  in conjunction with outside consultants is in the process of remediating or replacing the company s systems 
as the company was transitioning from a research and development company to a commercial operation  the company had already begun an assessment of information technology needs to support the evolving structure 
during  the company replaced all personal computers  with the exception of several computers connected to laboratory analytic equipment  with year compliant machines 
the company is in the process of upgrading internal applications to ensure yk compliance 
the company believes that all critical systems and software have been addressed and an assessment as to the date critical nature of the laboratory computers will be complete with a plan to replace those machines if necessary by the end of the company has spent less than million on the systems upgrades to date 
additional expenditures are expected to be less than  the company uses outside vendors to produce  encapsulate  package  process orders  invoice and maintain accounts receivable records for thalomid 
the company is in the process of receiving certifications from such vendors 
most responses to date indicate the systems are or will be yk compliant before the end of because the company s yk compliance is dependent upon key third parties also being year compliant on a timely basis  there can be no guarantee that the company s efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
if the company s systems or those of key third parties are not fully yk functional  disruptions in operations could occur 
such disruptions could result in delays in the distribution of product  errors in customer order taking  disruption of clinical activities or delays in product development 
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans aimed at ameliorating such disruptions  to the extent practicable
