item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview riggs national corporation achieved earnings growth in  as net income for the corporation was million compared to million in income before taxes and minority interest for reached a record million  representing a increase over the total of million 
the growth in earnings was attributable to increases in both of the major components of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income for was million  an increase of over million for noninterest income  excluding securities gains  totaled million in  an increase from in diluted earnings per share for and were and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were reduced by a one time charge of 
from the redemption of million of preferred stock 
the corporation s success in is reflected in the key measurements of profitability  return on average assets  and return on average stockholders equity 
return on average assets was for  compared to a ratio of for  and the return on average stockholders equity was in  compared to for results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in the level of interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities see tables a and b 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaled million in  an increase of million  or  over and an increase of million  or  over the net interest margin was for  a decrease of basis points from the prior year 
average interest earning assets increased during by million  while the average rate earned was relatively unchanged between the years 
this increase in average assets led to a million increase in interest income 
average interest bearing funds increased by million during the year with the average rate paid declining six basis points  resulting in an million increase in interest expense 
the increase in average earning assets during was generated by loan growth of million and million in additions to short term investments  offset by a million decline in the securities portfolio 
loan growth was strong in the commercial  residential and commercial real estate  and foreign loan portfolios and investments were shifted from the available for sale portfolio to shorter term time deposit placements 
the average rates earned on loans and investment securities were down modestly in due to overall declines in the interest rate environment  while the rate on time deposit placements increased basis points from the net impact of these changes was minimal on the average rate for earning assets which totaled for  relatively unchanged from the prior year 
the increase in average interest bearing funds during was due mostly to the growth of million in interest bearing deposits and million in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements which were used by the corporation to fund loan growth 
the average rate paid on interest bearing funds decreased six basis points over with a four basis point decrease in total interest bearing deposits and a basis point drop in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
noninterest income the corporation s revenue mix shifted in the most recent year  primarily through increased trust and investment advisory income from riggs company 
noninterest revenue  excluding securities gains  accounted for of combined revenue in compared to in the prior year 
total noninterest income for was up million  or  over and million  or  over excluding securities gains of million and million for and  noninterest income increased in the current year 
trust and investment advisory income growth was million in  an increase of over service charges and fees also contributed to the growth in noninterest income  with an increase of million during the year  primarily from increases in merchant credit card and debit card fees 
the corporation also recognized a million gain in resulting from the termination of the riggs bank europe limited pension plan  which was replaced by a defined contribution plan 
this gain is reported in other operating income on the consolidated statements of income 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or over and an increase of million  or  over this increase is substantially the result of million in added personnel costs during the year  primarily attributable to increased incentive based compensation and staff costs associated with new business initiatives 
the number of employees at december  increased from december   with a year end total of  income taxes the corporation s provision for income taxes includes federal  state  local and international tax obligations 
income tax expense increased million in to million from million in the increased expense is a direct result of increased earnings  as the effective tax rate of for was relatively unchanged from the effective tax rate of for during and  the corporation reversed valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets which reduced income tax expense 
as substantially all of the valuation allowances have been reversed it is likely that the effective tax rate will increase in financial position and liquidity earning assets loans and investments are the primary earning assets of the corporation 
for  earning assets averaged billion compared to billion for average earning assets were over of average total assets in both years 
average loans represented of earning assets in while average securities and short term investments were of earning assets 
in  the mix was in average loans and in average investments see table a 
loans total loans at december  were billion  an increase of from year end about one half of the loan portfolio consists of residential mortgage  home equity  and consumer loans which are generated through community banking 
commercial loans generated through both the relationship banking and international banking activities represent the balance of the portfolio see tables c  d and e 
total loan growth was million with increases in excess of million in three primary areas residential mortgage  commercial and financial  and foreign loans 
the increase in residential mortgage loans was due primarily to the purchase of million of bulk loans offset by prepayments of loans during the year 
commercial and financial growth was year over year and resulted from the corporation s increased focus on new loan production along with increased demand due to a strong economy in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
foreign lending increased in with the primary increases noted in riggs bank europe limited 
rbel s loans are commercial in nature and are made predominantly in the united kingdom 
rbel experienced growth in in each of its three lending areas  property finance  trade finance and general corporate lending 
cross border outstandings the corporation extends credit to borrowers domiciled outside of the united states through several of its banking subsidiaries 
cross border outstandings include loans  acceptances  interest bearing deposits with other banks  investments  and other monetary assets that are denominated in us dollars or other currencies 
in addition  cross border outstandings include legally enforceable guarantees issued on behalf of non local third parties and local currency outstandings to the extent they are not funded by local currency borrowings 
these assets may be impacted by changing economic conditions in the respective countries 
management routinely reviews these credits and continually monitors the international economic climate and assesses the impact of these changes on foreign domiciled borrowers 
at december   the corporation had no cross border outstandings exceeding of its total assets to countries experiencing difficulties in repaying their external debt 
at december   the united kingdom was the only foreign country with cross border outstandings in excess of of the corporation s total assets that had loans in either a nonperforming  past due or potential problem loan status see tables f and g 
short term investments short term investments include time deposits with other banks  federal funds sold and reverse repurchase agreements 
these investments are liquid assets with original maturities of less than days 
short term investments are lower yielding assets that are highly interest rate sensitive 
funds available for short term investments generally are a function of daily movements in the corporation s securities  loans and deposit portfolios  combined with the corporation s overall interest rate risk and asset liability strategy 
liquidity is also available to the corporation through credit facilities with federal home loan banks 
the corporation has secured and unsecured lines of credit that exceed billion which could be drawn upon to meet potential funding requirements 
at december   total short term investments decreased by million  or  when compared to year end due to normal daily fluctuations from the corporation s ongoing liquidity management process 
on average short term investments increased million in partially due to decreases in the securities portfolio 
securities securities of the corporation consist of securities available for sale that are carried on the statements of condition at market value 
the unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported net of tax in stockholders equity 
the securities portfolio totaled million at december   with an average duration of years and an average yield of 
these securities consisted primarily of us treasuries  us government agency and mortgage backed securities 
at december   securities available for sale had million of unrealized losses before taxes see table h 
at december   the portfolio totaled billion with an average life of years and an average yield of 
the securities portfolio decreased million on average in the decrease in average securities was mainly due to repositioning of the balance sheet resulting from loan growth and redemption of preferred stock by the corporation of million 
these decreases were offset by an increase in average short term investments in as part of the corporation s asset liability strategy  securities available for sale may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  risk characteristics and other factors 
the corporation realized net gains of million in compared with million in these sales were the result of a repositioning of the securities portfolio as the corporation replaced us treasuries with mortgage backed securities and extended the portfolio duration to years 
the yield declined approximately basis points due to the declining interest rate environment in asset quality credit risk management a key objective of management is to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio through high underwriting standards and regular evaluation of credit risk in the portfolio 
the potential for loss is intrinsic to the lending process and management attempts to minimize these losses 
however  the amount of loss will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the corporation has comprehensive policies and procedures that cover both loan origination and management of risk 
the corporation s credit administration group establishes credit policies including approval of underwriting standards  lending limit authorities and concentration limits 
business unit managers throughout the corporation have primary responsibility to evaluate  monitor and manage credit risk within policy guidelines for each portfolio 
credit administration reports to the chief credit officer and works with business units to ensure the integrity of the credit process 
an independent loan review function monitors compliance with the corporation s credit policies and further ensures the integrity of the credit process 
provision and reserve for loan losses the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the reserve for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan losses is based on management s assessment of existing conditions and of potential losses determined to be probable and subject to reasonable estimation 
the corporation determines the appropriate balance of the reserve for loan losses based upon an analysis of inherent risk and other factors that include primary sources of repayment on individual loans and groups of similar loans  liquidity and financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  historical charge offs writedowns within loan categories  loan trends and general economic conditions 
on a quarterly basis  the loan loss reserve committee evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
in  no provisions were made to the reserve for loan losses compared to a negative provision of million for the reserve for loan losses was million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or of total loans  at december  see table i 
the reserve for loan losses is reduced by loans charged off during the year and increased by recoveries of loans that were previously charged off 
the loan portfolio remained strong in as evidenced by net recoveries totaling million compared with thousand of net recoveries for net recoveries for were mostly attributed to million recovered from commercial real estate loans 
these recoveries were partially offset by relatively low levels of charge offs  including million related to consumer loans and thousand in foreign loans 
the net recoveries experienced during contributed to the corporation s decision to not record a provision for loan losses during the year 
net recoveries were experienced in and as well  which contributed to the decision to reverse million from the reserve for loan losses in the fourth quarter of foreign exchange translation adjustments in the reserve for loan losses were thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
these adjustments relate to reserves for the bank s london branch and riggs bank europe limited  recorded in british pounds sterling  and are made to account for changes in the corporation s reserve for loan losses resulting from fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
the estimated allocation of the reserve for loan losses by loan category is detailed in table j and represents management s assessment of existing conditions and risk factors within these categories 
changes in the risk characteristics and commitment amounts within the loan portfolio impact the overall level of required reserves 
during  the commercial and financial allocation increased substantially because of the increased lending in this area along with the specific reserve assigned to a million commercial loan which was placed on nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter 
the reserve allocation for real estate residential and commercial construction loans decreased while the combined balances in these portfolios remained relatively stable during the decreased allocation for commercial construction loans is primarily the result of significant criticized loan balances in one industry concentration being paid down or upgraded in the fourth quarter of the most recent year 
also  additions to the residential real estate portfolio resulted from bulk loan purchases that are well secured with relatively low risk characteristics 
the reduced allocation for home equity and consumer loans is a direct result of continued low charge off levels  as reserves for this classification are determined based upon the corporation s historical charge off experience 
the allocation for foreign loans increased in in proportion to the overall balance increase in this portfolio 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  and other real estate owned 
nonaccrual loans are loans for which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
impaired loans are nonaccrual loans for which it is probable that all amounts due will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement see tables k and l 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when  in management s opinion  there is doubt as to the ability to collect either interest or principal  or when interest or principal is days or more past due  and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection 
nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  this increase during was primarily attributable to a million commercial loan entering nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of a specific reserve was assigned to the million commercial loan that entered nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of  however  this specific reserve did not cause an increase in the total amount of reserve for loan losses as improvements in other factors offset the need for a provision 
these factors included the removal of certain commercial loans from the corporation s criticized loan classification and a reduction in the corporation s overall qualitative reserves 
the reduction in qualitative reserves resulted from the analysis of various factors  the most significant of which were a reduction in industry concentration risk and an improvement in the corporation s credit process as determined by a series of independent loan reviews in the low level of nonaccrual loans in contributed to the decision to reverse million from the provision for loan losses in the prior year 
renegotiated loans are those where there have been extensions of the original repayment period or a reduction of principal or interest because of a deterioration in the borrower s financial position 
at december  and  all renegotiated loans were not accruing interest 
renegotiated loans remained at a low level during and ended the year at million  compared with thousand at year end the increase of million during is attributable to two foreign loans 
loans are transferred to other real estate owned when collateral securing the loans is acquired through foreclosure 
other real estate owned decreased to million at december   from million at december  the remaining balance consists of two tracts of land in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
past due and potential problem loans past due loans generally consist of residential real estate and consumer loans that are well secured and in the process of collection for which the corporation is accruing interest 
at december  the past due loan category also included a foreign government overdraft of million  on which the corporation is accruing interest 
past due loan increases at year end were primarily the result of this foreign government loan 
potential problem loans are defined as loans that are currently performing but which management believes have certain attributes that may lead to nonaccrual or past due status in the foreseeable future 
at december   the corporation had not identified any such loans compared to million in potential problem loans at december  at year end  the potential problem loans consisted primarily of commercial and financial loans 
deposits and funding sources deposits  short term borrowings  long term debt and trust preferred securities are the primary funding sources of the corporation 
for  interest bearing funds averaged billion compared to billion for average interest bearing funds were over of average total liabilities in and noninterest bearing demand deposits represent an additional of total liabilities see table a 
deposits deposits remained the primary source of funding for the corporation s activities during on average in deposits totaled billion compared with billion in the average balance consisted of billion in interest bearing deposits and million of noninterest bearing demand deposits 
demand deposits decreased during partially due to a new program in which certain noninterest bearing accounts are transferred to the money market classification  thereby reducing the level of required reserves 
domestic and foreign time deposits increased million on average in with the largest portion of growth occurring in deposits where individual balances are in excess of  the increase in time deposits was partially offset by an average decrease of million in money market accounts 
the rates paid on time deposits in domestic offices were and in and  respectively  compared to rates of and  respectively  for time deposits with denominations in excess of  the lower rate on larger deposits is due primarily to the impact of balances maintained by corporate and government customers for which interest rates are based on an analysis of all banking services provided 
short term borrowings short term borrowings consist primarily of federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  and us treasury demand notes 
these short term obligations are an additional source of funds used to meet certain asset liability and daily cash management objectives 
on average  short term borrowings increased million  or  to million at december  the increase in the balances during was used to fund loan growth during the year see table m 
long term debt long term debt totaled million at december  and included in long term debt were subordinated debentures of million due in and subordinated notes of million due in the debentures due in have a fixed interest rate of and are not callable in advance of maturity 
the notes due in have a fixed interest rate of and are callable beginning february  at a price 
the call premium on these notes is reduced by 
annually until the notes are callable at par beginning february  trust preferred securities guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities totaled million at december  and included in these securities are million of securities issued in and million of securities issued in the securities were issued by wholly owned subsidiaries of the corporation and are classified on the consolidated statements of condition as guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
the related expense is classified on the consolidated statements of income as minority interest in income of subsidiaries  net of taxes 
dividends are paid semi annually and the trust preferred securities cannot be redeemed for ten years from the date of issuance 
the securities have a final maturity of years from their issuance date 
dividends are cumulative and deferrable for a period not to exceed five years 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital  with certain limitations 
sensitivity to market risk the corporation is exposed to various market risks 
it has determined that interest rate risk has a material impact on the corporation s financial performance  and as such has established the asset liability committee alco to manage interest rate risk and liquidity 
asset liability management is the process of managing earning assets and funding sources in changing interest rate environments 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to manage the asset liability mix of the corporation and maximize net interest income within an acceptable range of risk 
the corporation manages its interest rate risk through the use of an income simulation model that forecasts the impact on net interest income of a variety of different interest rate scenarios 
the model evaluates the impact on net interest income of rates moving significantly higher or lower than a most likely scenario 
the results are compared to risk tolerance limits set by corporate policy for and month horizons 
the interest rate scenarios monitored by alco are based upon a basis point gradual increase or decrease in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month time period and a basis point gradual increase or decrease in rates versus the most likely scenario over a month time period 
the results of the simulation for year end and indicated that the corporation was within the established guidelines see table n 
in managing the corporation s interest rate risk  alco uses financial derivative instruments  such as foreign currency and interest rate swaps 
financial derivatives are employed to assist in the management and or reduction of the interest rate risk and currency risk of the corporation 
all of these instruments are considered off balance sheet  as they do not materially affect the level of assets or liabilities of the corporation 
at december   the corporation s use of derivatives was limited 
first  the corporation had an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million on a pool of mortgage loans 
this swap diminishes the risk of holding long term  fixed rate loans 
the corporation also had foreign currency exchange contracts for a notional amount of million to hedge the equity investment at riggs bank europe limited 
the foreign currency contracts mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates 
in addition  riggs bank europe limited used interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate loans into floating rate assets 
there were such interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  for rbel totaling million in notional principal balance 
also  the corporation had approximately million in commitments to sell foreign exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging intercompany loans 
management finds that the methodologies discussed above provide a meaningful representation of the corporation s interest rate and market risk sensitivity  though factors other than changes in the interest rate environment  such as levels of non earning assets  and changes in the composition of earning assets  may affect net interest income 
management believes its current interest rate sensitivity level is appropriate  considering the corporation s economic outlook and conservative approach taken in the review and monitoring of the corporation s sensitivity position 
capital resources a fundamental objective of management is to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to take advantage of favorable investment opportunities and to promote depositor and investor confidence 
the corporation places an emphasis on capital strength and the ability of the corporation to withstand unfavorable economic and or business losses 
the corporation continues to maintain a strong capital position at december  total stockholders equity at december  was million  down million from year end the decrease was the result of the corporation redeeming all outstanding shares of its million non cumulative perpetual series b preferred stock 
the preferred stock had an annual dividend rate of and a redemption price of per share  resulting in a reduction to the corporation s equity of million 
this reduction in equity was offset by earnings for the year totaling million  less dividends paid on preferred and common stock 
regulators have issued risk based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies 
these requirements provide minimum total  tier i  and leverage capital ratios that measure capital adequacy 
total capital measures combined tier i and tier ii capital to risk weighted assets 
tier i capital measures tier i capital to risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio measures tier i capital to quarterly average assets 
at december   the corporation s and the bank s capital ratios exceed the well capitalized levels under each of the regulatory ratios see table o 
the corporation s policy is to ensure that its bank subsidiary is capitalized in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
the corporation s national bank subsidiary is subject to minimum capital ratios as prescribed by the office of the comptroller of the currency  which are the same as those prescribed by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 
year readiness disclosure general advances and changes in technology can have a significant impact on the corporation s business 
financial institutions are dependent on information systems and also have many external interdependencies with other companies 
many computer programs were designed to recognize calendar years by their last two digits 
calculations performed using these digits may not work properly with dates beginning in the year and beyond 
the year issue creates risk for the corporation from unforeseen problems in its computer systems and from year issues with the corporation s vendors  service providers and customers 
approach and risk the corporation began to identify the risks associated with the year in management established a corporate oversight structure to ensure timely risk assessments  remediation plans  systems testing  conversions  and centralized management of the project 
the structure of the effort entails a number of groups  each addressing a different aspect of the project  and reporting to the year program manager 
oversight of the entire project is performed by the year advisory group 
this is a management committee appointed by the board of directors that reports to the board on a quarterly basis 
management determined that an enterprise wide business risk assessment approach is most appropriate for addressing and remediating year problems 
this included an assessment of the information technology resources of each of the functional areas in the corporation  as well as separate assessments of information technology vendors and suppliers  mainframe applications  third party suppliers  alternative platforms  and non information technology and facilities risks 
in addition to systems related risks  the corporation undertook a review of risks created by potential business interruptions suffered by the corporation s major business counterparties  both domestic and foreign 
the corporation divided its business counterparties into three broad categories funds takers primarily borrowers  funds providers depositors and other funding sources  and capital markets partners trading counterparties and fiduciary relationships 
for those business partners that would have a significant impact on the corporation s liquidity  income or capital markets activities  should they encounter significant business interruption due to the year  management has worked through the functional areas involved to assess readiness and contingency plans for recovering from an abrupt interruption 
after the assessment phase  year efforts have focused on remediation and verification 
the corporation has developed detailed action plans to address mainframe systems  third party servicers  embedded technology and facilities and non information technology issues 
for purchased systems and software and third party servicers  the year efforts have involved contacting the vendors or suppliers and determining the year status of the various systems and of the plans to bring the systems into compliance 
for in house systems  the year efforts include correction of the programs to ensure proper data processing 
the corporation s action plans also include testing mission critical systems to verify the remediation efforts 
riggs records and tracks information to keep management aware of the status of the corporation s information technology systems 
the program manager is working with the functional areas of the corporation to develop contingency plans for a variety of situations  such as the failure of a vendor to remediate year issues by a particular date or a system not being available for processing 
inherent in the year  the failure to correct a material problem could result in an interruption in or failure of certain business operations 
year risks and uncertainties include increased credit losses  service delays  funding delays  counterparty failures  inaccurate information processing  atm failures  and problems with international accounts 
there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse impact on the corporation s financial position  results of operations  or relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
state of readiness while there is general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the readiness of third party vendors and customers  the corporation s progress toward completing the enterprise wide risk assessment and remediating year problems is on target 
management substantially completed remediation and verification of all mission critical internal systems by december  management expects to substantially complete remediation and verification of mission critical third party servicers by march  this is in accordance with guidelines established by bank regulatory authorities 
verification of non mission critical system changes  including non information technology issues  will be performed throughout the corporation presently believes that the year issue will not cause significant operational problems 
costs the total cost to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the corporation s financial position 
the corporation estimates the total cost of the year project will be approximately million  with funds provided from operating cash flows 
as of december   the total amount expended was million  with million of this expense incurred in the future cost of completing the year project is estimated to be million 
the most significant components of the total estimated cost consist of for personnel related costs  including consultants and special year incentives  and for data processing services 
the corporation does not separately track all internal costs incurred for the year project 
internal costs are principally the payroll related costs for the information systems group 
the year expense represents approximately of the corporation s total actual information technology expenditures for other significant or critical non year information technology efforts have not been materially delayed or impacted by year initiatives 
contingency plans to prepare for the possibility that certain information systems or third party vendors and servicers will not be year compliant  the corporation is developing detailed contingency plans 
the corporation has two types of contingency plans  remediation plans and business resumption plans 
the remediation plans address those information systems that the corporation determines are not currently  or may not be  year compliant through our testing 
these plans describe and schedule alternative provisions  including  if necessary  the replacement of vendors or third party servicers to ensure compliance 
these remediation plans are complete 
the business resumption plans address how the corporation will continue operations in the event a year related interruption occurs 
the business resumption plans for its mission critical systems and third party servicers are scheduled to be complete by june  while implementation of the business resumption plans is not expected to be necessary  it will ensure the corporation has the ability to process transactions and serve its customers under circumstances in which a year problem actually occurs 
forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates 
such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  projections on the corporation s tax rate and tax expense in management s discussion and analysis md a  discussions of loans and loan losses in md a  comments related to the redemption of preferred stock and buyback of common stock in md a  discussions of asset liability management and related risk in md a  and disclosures related to the year in md a 
the risks and uncertainties associated with forward looking statements include  among other things  significant changes in general economic conditions  both domestic and international  the impact of market and economic conditions on debt  equity and assumptions made in the redemption of preferred stock  sharp changes in credit quality or interest rates  changes in the corporation s tax liability and rates  and the corporation s ability and resources to execute its business strategies and manage risks associated with potential expansion plans or the year issue
