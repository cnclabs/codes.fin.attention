item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company s primary focus has been on providing operating leases of aftermarket commercial aircraft engines and other aircraft related equipment 
as of december   the company had lessees in countries and its lease portfolio consisted of engines  five commuter aircraft and seven spare parts packages with an aggregate net book value of million 
the company targets medium term operating leases  typically with initial lease terms of three to seven years  where the company retains the risks and benefits associated with the residual value of the leased asset 
the company actively manages its portfolio and structures its leases in order to enhance these residual values 
the company s leasing business focuses on popular stage iii commercial jet aircraft engines manufactured by cfm  general electric  pratt whitney and rolls royce 
these engines are the most widely used aircraft engines in the world  powering boeing  mcdonnell douglas and airbus aircraft 
in  the company began selling aircraft parts and components to its customers through wasi 
wasi s strategy is to focus on the acquisition of aviation equipment  such as whole engines and aircraft  which can be dismantled and sold as parts at a greater profit 
wasi also supplies certain parts and components used in the maintenance  repair and overhaul of the company s portfolio of aircraft and engines 
finally  wasi provides an alternate method for realizing the maximum value from an engine in our lease portfolio through dismantling the engine and selling the individual parts and components 
in  the company began disassembling large commercial jet engines and providing parts cleaning  testing and classification services through pgtc 
pgtc received certification in november from the faa to perform maintenance  repair and overhaul services for pratt whitney jtd and jtd engines and has since commenced offering and performing and offering maintenance  repair and overhaul services to and for wasi and third parties 
pgtc will purchase parts from wasi for use during the maintenance  repair and overhaul of engines 
pgtc had no material third party revenues in and is therefore not presented as a separate business segment herein 
leasing related activities 
revenue from leasing of aircraft equipment is recognized as operating lease or finance lease revenue over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
the vast majority of the company s leases are accounted for as operating leases 
under an operating lease  the company retains title to the leased equipment  thereby retaining the potential benefit and assuming the risk of the residual value of the leased equipment 
the company generally depreciates engines on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
spare parts packages are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
aircraft are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over years to a residual value 
at the commencement of each lease  the company typically collects security deposits normally equal to at least one month s lease payment and maintenance reserves normally equal to one month s estimated maintenance expenses from the lessee 
the security deposit is returned to the lessee after all return conditions have been met 
maintenance reserves are accumulated in accounts maintained by the company or the company s lenders and are used when normal repair associated with engine use or maintenance is required 
in many cases  to the extent that cumulative maintenance reserves are inadequate to fund normal repairs required prior to return of the engine to the company  the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall 
for equipment sold out of the company s lease portfolio  the company recognizes the gain associated with the sale as revenue 
gain consists of sales proceeds less the net book value of the equipment sold and any direct costs associated with the sale 
additionally  to the extent that any deposits or reserves are not included in the sale and the purchaser of the equipment assumes any liabilities associated therewith  such deposits and reserves are included in the gain on sale 
the company engages in the selective purchase and sale of commercial aircraft engines and engine components 
assets acquired for resale are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
gross revenue from the sale of equipment is reflected as sale of equipment acquired for resale with the corresponding cost of the equipment shown as an expense item 
spare parts sales 
wasi acquires aviation equipment  such as whole engines and aircraft  which can be dismantled and sold as parts at a greater profit 
the company records the purchases at cost and capitalizes additional costs relating to acquisition  overhaul  insurance and other direct costs 
gross revenue from the sale of parts is reflected as spare parts sales 
wasi may also engage in the short term leasing of engines destined for disassembly and sale of parts 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue is summarized as follows year ended december  amount amount dollars in thousands lease revenue   gain on sale of leased equipment   spare parts sales   sale of equipment acquired for resale   interest and other income  total   leasing related activities 
lease related revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects lease related revenues from additional engines  aircraft and spare parts packages 
the aggregate of net book value of leased equipment and net investment in direct finance lease at december  and was million and million  respectively  an increase of 
during  engines  three aircraft  and one spare parts package were added to the company s lease portfolio at a total cost of million 
ten engines  one spare parts package and one aircraft from the lease portfolio were sold or transferred to wasi for sale as parts 
the engines and the aircraft had a total net book value of million and were sold for a gain of million 
during the year ended december   the company sold six engines from the lease portfolio 
these engines had a net book value of million and were sold for a gain of million 
during the year ended december   the company sold one engine acquired for resale for million which resulted in a gain of million  compared to the year ended december   during which the company sold ten engines acquired for resale for million resulting in a gain of million 
included in the sales was one transaction involving the sale of four engines acquired at a cost of  and sold for a gain of  equipment sales opportunities and profitability may vary materially from period to period 
spare parts sales 
revenues from spare parts sales increased to million compared to the year ended december  the gross margin  decreased to in  from in the corresponding period in this decrease was due to increased provisions for write downs of inventory  the company s decision to sell  shortly after their acquisition  certain of the engines acquired under its agreement with united airlines  thus avoiding carrying costs and a change in the mix of engine type parts sold 
interest and other income 
interest and other income for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december  this is a result of interest earned on cash and deposits held 
interest expense and residual sharing 
interest expense related to all activities increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in  due to an increase in average debt outstanding during the period 
this increase in debt was primarily related to debt associated with the increase in lease portfolio assets and to a lesser extent an increase in spare parts inventories 
we accrue for our residual sharing obligations using net book value as a proxy for residual proceeds 
residual sharing expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period in the decline was due to the repayment  in march  of one of the company s loans which had residual sharing provisions 
residual sharing arrangements apply to three of the company s engines as of december  depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in  due primarily to the increase in lease portfolio assets in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in this increase reflects expenses  in all business segments  associated with staff additions  increased rent due to the expansion of the facilities  as well as an increase in professional fees and insurance expense 
income taxes 
income taxes  exclusive of tax on extraordinary items  for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects an increase in the company s pre tax earnings 
extraordinary item 
in march   the company repaid a loan that had residual sharing provisions and an interest rate of 
the repayment resulted in an extraordinary expense of million  net of tax 
in february  the company obtained a new loan agreement for million to replace an existing loan of million 
the transaction resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue is summarized as follows year ended december  amount amount dollars in thousands lease revenue   gain on sale of leased equipment  spare parts sales   sale of equipment acquired for resale   interest and other income total   leasing related activities 
lease related revenue for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects lease revenues from additional engines and spare parts packages 
the aggregate of net book value of leased equipment and net investment in direct finance lease at december  and was million and million  respectively  an increase of 
during  engines  three aircraft  and five spare parts packages were added to the company s lease portfolio at a total cost of million 
nine engines from the lease portfolio were sold or transferred to wasi for sale as parts 
during the year ended december   the company sold six engines from the lease portfolio 
these engines had a net book value of million and they were sold for a gain of million 
during the year ended december   the company sold ten engines acquired for resale for million which resulted in a gain of million  compared to the year ended december   during which the company sold four engines acquired for resale for million resulting in a gain of million 
included in the sales was one transaction involving the sale of four engines acquired at a cost of  and sold for a gain of  equipment sales opportunities and profitability may vary materially from period to period 
spare parts sales 
revenues from spare parts sales increased to million compared to the year ended december  the gross margin  decreased to in  from in the corresponding period in interest and other income 
interest and other income for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the year ended december  this is a result of interest earned on deposits held  primarily the proceeds from the initial public offering 
interest expense and residual sharing 
interest expense related to all activities increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in  due primarily to an increased loan base and the replacement of an existing facility with a new loan agreement in the first quarter of bearing a higher interest rate 
residual sharing expense increased to million for the year ended december   from the million for the comparable period in depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in  due to the larger asset base in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from the comparable period in this increase reflects expenses associated with staff additions  increased rent due to the expansion of the wasi facility  as well as an increase in professional fees  insurance expense and public company costs 
income taxes 
income taxes  exclusive of tax on extraordinary items  for the year ended december   increased to million from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects an increase in the company s pre tax earnings 
extraordinary item 
in february  the company obtained a new loan agreement for million to replace an existing loan of million 
the transaction resulted in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value 
this statement is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company is reviewing the effect this standard will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its growth through borrowings secured by its equipment lease portfolio 
cash of approximately million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from this activity 
in these same time periods million  million and million  respectively  was used to pay down related debt or capital lease 
in december  net proceeds from a follow on common stock offering were approximately million 
in september  net proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million 
cash flow from operating activities used approximately million in the year ended december  and cash flows from operating activities generated million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the deficit cash flow from operations in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of used aircraft assets for wasi s inventory and deposits made in connection with future  committed inventory purchases 
such deposits are carried as other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s primary use of funds is for the purchase of equipment for lease 
approximately million  million and million of funds were used for this purpose in the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   the company had a million revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts for sale or lease as well as for general working capital purposes 
as of december   million was available under this facility  subject to the company providing sufficient collateral 
the facility has a two year revolving period followed by a four year term out period 
the facility is renewable annually 
the company has an million debt warehouse facility  to a fully owned special purpose finance subsidiary of the company  wlfc funding corporation  for the financing of jet aircraft engines transferred by the company to such finance subsidiary 
this transaction s structure facilitates future public or private securitized note issuances by the special purpose finance subsidiary 
the subsidiary is consolidated for financial statement presentation purposes 
the facility has an eight year initial term 
the company has guaranteed the obligations under the facility on a limited basis  up to an amount equal to the greater of i the lesser of million and of the outstanding obligations and ii of the outstanding obligations 
the facility requires the company to hedge a certain portion of the debt against interest rate changes 
in may  a three year million interest rate swap was executed to hedge a portion of the interest expense under this facility 
additionally  in august  a five year million interest rate swap was executed 
assuming compliance with the facility s terms  including sufficiency of collateral  as of december   million was available under this facility 
approximately million of the company s debt is repayable during such repayments consist of scheduled installments due under term loans 
the company believes that its current equity base  internally generated funds and debt facilities are sufficient to fund the company s anticipated operations into the second quarter of  at which time additional capital will be required to fund projected growth 
the company is currently discussing  with its commercial and investment banks  additions to its debt facilities 
as of december   the company had four engines and four spare parts packages  which had not been financed 
the company may seek financing for this equipment  although no assurance can be given that such financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  certain of the company s engines have been financed under floating rate facilities 
until fixed rate financing for these assets is in place  the company is subject to interest rate risk  since the underlying lease revenue is fixed 
see management interest rate exposure below 
the company has committed to purchase  during  additional used aircraft and used and new engines for its operations 
certain deposits  in  were made in connection with these commitments 
as of december   the company s current commitment to such purchases is not more than million  which includes million of deposits in other assets 
management of interest rate exposure at december   million of the company s borrowings were on a variable rate basis at various interest rates tied to either libor or the prime rate 
the company s equipment leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate that the company pays under its borrowings 
in september  the company purchased an amortizing interest rate cap in order to limit its exposure to increases in interest rates on a portion of its variable rate borrowings 
pursuant to this cap  the counter party will make payments to the company  based on the notional amount of the cap  if the three month libor rate is in excess of 
as of december   the notional principal amount of the cap was million  which will decline to million at the end of its term 
the cost of the cap is being amortized as an expense over its remaining term 
to further mitigate exposure to interest rate changes  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in december  which has a notional outstanding amount of million  a duration of two years and a fixed rate of 
under its borrowing agreement  wlfc funding corporation is required to hedge a certain portion of its million warehouse facility against changes in interest rates 
wlfc has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to meet such hedging requirements and to manage the variable interest rate risk related to its debt 
as of december   such swap agreements had notional outstanding amounts of million  a weighted average remaining duration of months and a weighted average fixed rate of the company will be exposed to risk in the event of non performance of the interest rate hedge counter parties 
the company anticipates that it will hedge additional amounts of its floating rate debt during the next several months 
factors that may affect future results except for historical information contained herein  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of the company s plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere herein and in the company s report on forms k and ka for the year ended december  the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report or in other written or oral statements by the company 
the businesses in which the company is engaged are capital intensive businesses 
accordingly  the company s ability to successfully execute its business strategy and to sustain its operations is dependent  in large part  on the availability of debt and equity capital 
there can be no assurance that the necessary amount of such capital will continue to be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
if the company is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital  the company s ability to i add new aircraft engines  aircraft and spare parts packages to its portfolio  ii add inventory to support its spare parts sales  iii fund its working capital needs  iv develop the business of pgtc  and v finance possible future acquisitions  would be impaired 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient capital would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company retains title to the aircraft engines  aircraft and parts packages that it leases to third parties 
upon termination of a lease  the company will seek to re lease or sell the aircraft equipment or will dismantle the equipment and will sell the parts 
the company also engages in the selective purchase and resale of commercial aircraft engines and engine components 
on occasion  the company purchases engines or components without having a firm commitment for their sale 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis  including the following i general market conditions  ii the condition of the aircraft equipment upon termination of the lease  iii the maintenance services performed during the lease term and  as applicable  the number of hours remaining until the next major maintenance is required  iv regulatory changes particularly those imposing environmental  maintenance and other requirements on the operation of aircraft engines  v changes in the supply or cost of aircraft engines  and vi technological developments 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
the failure to re lease or sell aircraft equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company experiences fluctuations in its operating results 
such fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including i general economic conditions  ii the timing of sales of engines and spare parts  iii financial difficulties experienced by airlines  iv interest rates  v fuel costs  vi downturns in the air transportation industry  vii increased fare competition  viii decreases in growth of air traffic  ix unanticipated early lease termination or a default by a lessee  x the timing of engine acquisitions  xi engine marketing activities  xii fluctuations in market prices for the company s assets 
the company anticipates that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
as a result  the company believes that comparisons to results of operations for preceding periods are not necessarily meaningful and that results of prior periods should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
a lessee may default in performance of its lease obligations and the company may be unable to enforce its remedies under a lease 
the company s inability to collect receivables due under a lease or to repossess aircraft equipment in the event of a default by a lessee could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
various airlines have experienced financial difficulties in the past  certain airlines have filed for bankruptcy and a number of such airlines have ceased operations 
in most cases where a debtor seeks protection under chapter of title of the united states code  creditors are automatically stayed from enforcing their rights 
in the case of united states certified airlines  section of the bankruptcy code provides certain relief to lessors of aircraft equipment 
the scope of section has been the subject of significant litigation and there is no assurance that the provisions of section will protect the company s investment in an aircraft  aircraft engines or parts in the event of a lessee s bankruptcy 
in addition  section does not apply to lessees located outside of the united states and applicable foreign laws may not provide comparable protection 
leases of spare parts may involve additional risks 
for example  it is likely to be more difficult to recover parts in the event of a lessee default and the residual value of parts may be less ascertainable than an engine 
the company s leases are generally structured at fixed rental rates for specified terms while many of the company s borrowings are at a floating rate 
increases in interest rates could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  between the rental revenue the company realizes under its leases and the interest rate the company pays under its borrowings  and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
in  of the company s lease revenue was generated by leases to foreign customers  including from asian customers and from south american customers 
such international leases may present greater risks to the company because certain foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may not be as protective of lessor rights as those which apply in the united states 
the company is subject to the timing and access to courts and the remedies local laws impose in order to collect its lease payments and recover its assets 
in addition  political instability abroad and changes in international policy also present risk of expropriation of the company s leased engines 
furthermore  many foreign countries have currency and exchange laws regulating the international transfer of currencies 
the company generates a portion of its revenue from sale of leased assets 
the amount of such revenue  as a percentage of overall revenue  increased between and during  gains associated with sales to the two most significant purchasers of leased assets  kellstrom industries  inc and tpi aviation  ltd  constituted and of gains on sale of leased assets  respectively 
the inability to execute transactions for gain on sale or a change in the accounting guidelines related to such sales could have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company has recently experienced significant growth in revenues 
the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations  or that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations  in which event the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may also acquire businesses that would complement or expand the company s existing businesses 
any acquisition or expansion made by the company may result in one or more of the following events i the incurrence of additional debt  ii future charges to earnings related to the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  iii difficulties in the assimilation of operations  services  products and personnel  iv an inability to sustain or improve historical revenue levels  v diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  and vi potential loss of key employees 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the markets for the company s products and services are extremely competitive  and the company faces competition from a number of sources 
these include aircraft and aircraft part manufacturers  aircraft and aircraft engine lessors  airline and aircraft service companies and aircraft spare parts redistributors 
certain of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  including greater name recognition  larger inventories  a broader range of material  complementary lines of business and greater financial  marketing and other resources 
in addition  equipment manufacturers  aircraft maintenance providers  faa certified repair facilities and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that the company serves  thereby significantly increasing industry competition 
there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company s leasing activities generate significant depreciation allowances that provide the company with substantial tax benefits on an ongoing basis 
in addition  the company s lessees currently enjoy favorable accounting and tax treatment by entering into operating leases 
any change to current tax laws or accounting principles that make operating lease financing less attractive or affect the company s recognition of revenue or expense would have a material impact on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
before parts may be installed in an aircraft  they must meet certain standards of condition established by the faa and or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries 
specific regulations vary from country to country  although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with faa requirements 
parts must also be traceable to sources deemed acceptable by the faa or such equivalent regulatory agencies 
such standards may change in the future  requiring engine components already contained in the company s inventory to be scrapped or modified 
in all such cases  to the extent the company has such engine components in its inventory  their value may be reduced and the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company obtains a substantial portion of its inventories of aircraft  engines and engine parts from airlines  overhaul facilities and other suppliers 
there is no organized market for aircraft  engines and engine parts  and the company must rely on field representatives and personnel  advertisements and its reputation as a buyer of surplus inventory in order to generate opportunities to purchase such equipment 
the market for bulk sales of surplus aircraft  engines and engine parts is highly competitive  in some instances involving a bidding process 
while the company has been able to purchase surplus inventory in this manner successfully in the past  there is no assurance that surplus aircraft  engines and engine parts of the type required by the company s customers will be available on acceptable terms when needed in the future or that the company will continue to compete effectively in the purchase of such surplus equipment 
a change in the market for aircraft and engine parts could result in the company s inventory being overvalued and could require the company to write down its inventory valuations in order to bring them into line with the revised fair market value 
furthermore  when the company purchases and dismantles used aircraft  engines and parts  the company assigns a value to the parts based on market price 
airline manufacturers may also develop new parts to be used in lieu of parts already contained in the company s inventory 
there is no assurance that a write down would not adversely affect the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
the company uses computer systems in many areas of its operations 
in addition  various third parties that are important to the company s business including lessees  customers  vendors and financial institutions use computer systems in their areas of operations 
should the company or certain of such third parties not be year compliant  certain of the company s operations could be disrupted for an indeterminate period of time  potentially having a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
as is the case with most companies  the year computer problem creates risks for the company 
the company has assessed the year computer problem as it affects the company s computer systems and information technology 
as a result of the company s assessment  the company does not expect any material interruption of internal operations arising from of the company s computer systems and information technology not being year compliant 
the company is not aware of any significant year issues with respect to the airworthiness of the company s aircraft  aircraft engines or spare parts  however  should such issues result in airworthiness directives or other manufacturer recommended maintenance for leased assets  the implementation and the majority of the cost of such implementation would generally be the responsibility of the lessee 
any resulting costs to the company cannot be estimated at this time 
significant uncertainties remain about the effect on the company s operations of third parties that may not be year compliant and with whom the company does business including lessees  customers  vendors and financial institutions 
the company is in the process of assessing year issues relating to such third parties and certain of the company s officers have oversight of these assessments 
the company plans to circulate to significant third parties with whom the company does business a written request for their plans and progress in addressing the year issue  evaluate the responses  and develop contingency plans to address risks of non compliance by such third parties 
the company intends to complete this process by june the costs associated with assessing the year issue  including developing and implementing the above plan  are expected to be nominal 
non compliance on the part of a third party could result in lost revenue and an inability to make lease or other payments to the company 
non compliance by the third party s financial institution could also affect the ability to process payments 
a reasonable worst case scenario would be that a large number of third parties including lessees and spare parts customers will be unable to operate and generate revenues and as a result will be unable to make lease payments or purchase parts 
the company is unable to estimate the likelihood or the magnitude of the resulting lost revenue at this time 
however  should this occur  the company would attempt to repossess leased engines  aircraft and spare parts from non compliant third parties and place such assets with compliant third parties 
the company cannot assure you that it would be able to re lease such assets at favorable terms or at all 
similarly  the company would attempt to find compliant customers for the company s spare parts sales 
if a significant number of leased assets could not be re leased on favorable terms or at all  or their re lease is delayed  or if compliant customers for spare parts sales were unavailable  the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations would be adversely affected 
providers of casualty and liability insurance to the aviation industry have indicated that they may exclude coverage for year related risks and or may require aviation equipment operators to answer  to the insurance provider s satisfaction  a questionnaire regarding the year preparedness of aviation equipment operators  in order to provide coverage for year risks 
the inability of a lessee to obtain or maintain coverage for year related losses and or the company s inability to obtain or maintain any contingent insurance for year related risks would expose the company to material risk of loss 
the company is in the process of informing its lessees of year related insurance issues and will be monitoring its lessees ability to obtain insurance coverage for year related risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of interest rate risk 
a change in the us prime interest rate  libor rate  or cost of funds based on commercial paper market rates  would affect the rate at which the company could borrow funds under its various borrowing facilities 
increases in interest rates to the company  which may cause the company to raise the implicit rates charged to its customers  could result in a reduction in demand for the company s leases 
certain of the company s warehouse credit facilities are variable rate debt 
the company estimates a one percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum 
the company estimates a two percent increase or decrease in the company s variable rate debt would result in an increase or decrease  respectively  in interest expense of million per annum 
the foregoing effect of interest rate changes on per annum interest expense is estimated as constant due to the terms of the company s variable rate borrowings  which generally provide for the maintenance of borrowing levels given adequacy of collateral and compliance with other loan conditions 
the company hedges a portion of its borrowings  effectively fixing the rate of these borrowings 
the company is currently required to hedge a portion of debt of the wlfc funding corporation facility 
such hedging activities may limit the company s ability to participate in the benefits of any decrease in interest rates  but may also protect the company from increases in interest rates 
a portion of the company s leases provide that lease payments be adjusted based on changes in interest rates 
furthermore  since lease rates tend to vary with interest rate levels  it is likely that the company can adjust lease rates for the effect of change in interest rates at the termination of leases 
other financial assets and liabilities are at fixed rates 
the company is also exposed to currency devaluation risk 
during  of the company s total lease revenues came from non united states domiciled lessees 
all of the leases require payment in united states us currency 
if these lessees currency devalues against the us dollar  the lessees could potentially encounter difficulty in making the us dollar denominated lease payments
