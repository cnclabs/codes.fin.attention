during fiscal  the company implemented a plan to increase manufacturing capacity and refine production methods to meet anticipated future demand and to reduce product costs 
during fiscal  the company s manufacturing activities focused on retesting the devices repurchased from hmi to ensure their continuing compliance with new product standards and elective upgrade of certain of these units to current version configuration 
also during fiscal  manufacturing focused on finalizing product engineering and on planning for  designing and installing manufacturing lines for the new self injector device in advance of the launch of that product 
during fiscal  having a sufficient inventory of jet injectors on hand as a result of the repurchase of product from hmi  the company focused its manufacturing efforts on refining manufacturing processes and efficiencies of the disposable syringe manufacturing line 
on account of excess inventories of both b devices and biojector syringes  the company ceased manufacturing any material quantity of new products in july all but four employees directly involved in manufacturing were either laid off or transferred to other functions within the company

the company s revenues to date have not been sufficient to cover manufacturing and operating expenses 
however  the company believes that if its products attain significantly greater general market acceptance and if the company is able to enter into large volume supply agreements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  the company s product sales volume would increase 
significantly higher product sales volumes should allow the company to realize volume related manufacturing cost efficiencies 
this  in turn  should result in a reduced costs of goods as a percentage of sales  which could eventually allowing the company to achieve positive gross profit 
the company believes that positive gross profit from product sales  together with licensing and technology revenues from agreements entered into with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies would eventually allow the company to operate profitably 
see forward looking statements 
the level of revenues required to generate net income will be affected by a number of factors including the mix of revenues between product sales and licensing and technology fees  pricing of the company s products  its ability to attain volume related and automation related manufacturing efficiencies  and the impact of inflation on the company s manufacturing and other operating costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve sufficient cost reductions or sell its products at prices or in volumes sufficient to achieve profitability or offset increases in its costs should they occur 
see risk factors limited manufacturing experience 
further  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will be able to interest major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies in entering licensing or supply agreements 
see risk factors dependence on third party relationships 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
various factors may affect quarterly and yearly operating results including i length of time to close product sales  ii customer budget cycles  iii implementing cost reduction measures  iv uncertainties and changes in product sales due to third party payer policies and proposals relating to healthcare cost containment  v timing and amount of payments under licensing and technology development agreements  and vii timing of new product introductions by the company and its competition 
in the future  the company may incur a non cash charge to compensation expense in connection with the issuance of  shares of common stock to the company s chief executive officer and  shares of common stock to the company s chief financial officer 
under terms of their employment agreements  each will receive the shares of common stock when the company first achieves two consecutive quarters of positive earnings per share 
upon issuance of such shares the company will record a non cash charge to compensation at the fair market value of the stock on the last day of the quarter in which the shares are earned 
during the next fiscal year  the company will target its direct sales efforts toward i sales to existing markets  specifically flu immunization providers  public health agencies and public school systems  ii sales in markets such as the state of california  where the company believes that needle syringe safety legislation makes the company s products more price competitive  and iii sales to the us military 
sales through distributors will target the home  self injection market 
see forward looking statements  business marketing and competition and risk factors 
the company will also focus sales and marketing efforts on entering into licensing and supply arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies whose products the biojector technology provides either increased medical efficacy or a higher degree of market acceptance 
agreements under this type of arrangement would ordinarily include some or all of the following components i licensing revenues for full or partially exclusive access to the company s products for a specific application or medical indication  ii development fees if the company is customizing one of its products for the customer or developing a new product  iii milestone payments related to the customer s progress in developing products to be used in conjunction with the company s products  and iv product revenues from sale of the company s products to the customer pursuant to a supply agreement

also during the next fiscal year  the company will commence the manufacture and sale of the vitajet and conserve its fiscal resources 
the company does not expect to report net income from operations in fiscal see forward looking statements and risk factors 
results of operations product sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased to  in fiscal product sales in each of the three fiscal years consisted primarily of sales to public health and flu immunization clinics 
the sales decrease in fiscal was due to a reduction in fiscal flu season orders  a significant portion of which was attributable to certain customers using inventory acquired but not used in earlier periods to meet their current year flu season requirements and also due to a reduced direct sales force 
also contributing to the product sales decline in fiscal was certain customers misinterpreting regulatory labeling on certain flu vaccines and choosing not to use jet injection with that flu vaccine as a result of that labeling misinterpretation 
the company believes that the label interpretation problem is resolved and will not reoccur in the fiscal flu season

license and technology fees decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the fiscal fees consisted principally of product development revenues for work performed under the schering and hoffman laroche agreements 
the fiscal revenues related to work on the hoffman laroche project 
the fiscal revenues consisted primarily of development revenues for work on the pre filled syringe technology under the elan agreement and licensing fees received under the july agreement with merck 
manufacturing expense is made up of the cost of products sold and manufacturing overhead expense related to excess manufacturing capacity 
the total of these costs decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal the decrease in manufacturing expense from fiscal to fiscal reflects reductions in the cost of materials and labor for injectors and syringes as well as reductions in fixed and variable manufacturing overhead expense 
the increase in manufacturing expense from fiscal to fiscal reflects i reduced inventory buildup resulting in less manufacturing overhead being absorbed  ii increased depreciation expense  and iii a reduction in the carrying value of raw material and finished goods inventories to levels estimated to be equal to one year s supply based upon sales activity for the years ended march  and manufacturing overhead totaled million   and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
research and development expense decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal  exclusive of acquired in process research and development and increased to  in fiscal fiscal research and development expenditures were principally related to final design and transfer to manufacturing of the schering device and to development work on the b hoffman laroche system 
fiscal expenditures related principally to further development of the b self injector and to pursuing regulatory clearance for the vial adapter

net proceeds received upon issuance of securities from inception through march   totaled approximately million 
the company has no long term debt 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at march  and million at march  the decrease resulted from operating losses and capital expenditures which were partly offset by approximately million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock warrants and stock options 
inventories decreased from million at march  to million at march   primarily due to a reduction in the carrying value of raw material and finished goods inventories to levels estimated to be equal to one year s supply based upon sales activity for the years ended march   and the company has fixed commitments for facilities rent and equipment leases which total approximately  for fiscal the company purchased capital equipment for use on the needle free side of the business of approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the company believes that its current cash position  together with net proceeds which may be received from the proposed sale of the blood glucose monitoring technology  combined with revenues and other cash receipts will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through the first quarter of fiscal the sale of the blood glucose monitoring technology is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and satisfaction of certain conditions  so there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed on the terms anticipated by the company or at all 
in addition  the company is pursuing a number of additional financing sources 
see forward looking statements 
even if the company is successful in raising additional financing  unforeseen costs and expenses or lower than anticipated cash receipts from product sales or research and development activities could accelerate or increase the financing requirements 
the company has been successful in raising additional financing in the past and believes that sufficient funds will be available to fund future operations 
see forward looking statements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s efforts will be successful  and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms which are not significantly dilutive to existing shareholders 
failure to obtain needed additional capital on terms acceptable to the company  or at all  would significantly restrict the company s operations and ability to continue product development and growth and would have a material adverse affect the company s business 
the company has no banking line of credit or other established source of borrowing 
because of these uncertainties  the company s independent public accountants have qualified their opinion with respect to the company s ability to continue as a going concern

year issues the company is in the process of assessing and implementing remedial action with regards to its year yk issues 
the assessment includes steps to review and obtain vendor certification of yk compliance of current systems  testing system compliance and implementing corrective action where necessary 
a yk team composed of manager level members from manufacturing  purchasing  information services and finance is continuing to conduct the assessment 
assessment of the compliance of all critical systems  plans for remedial action  if any  and estimates of the cost of such remedial action have been completed 
the cost to address the company s yk issues have been estimated to be insignificant and funds expended are expected to be derived from normal maintenance and upgrade operating budgets 
products the company s products do not incorporate either application or embedded software and are therefore not subject to yk issues 
information systems the company utilizes packaged application software for all critical information systems functions which have been certified by the vendors as being yk compliant 
this includes financial software  operating and networking systems  application and data servers  pc and communications hardware and core office automation software 
the company is in the process of testing the reliability of the application software and expects this to be complete by mid august 
manufacturing systems the company has received manufacturer certification of yk compliance for all critical automated components used in manufacturing the company s products 
supplier base the company has implemented a yk audit program of suppliers critical to the company s operations 
these suppliers have certified yk compliance of systems critical to maintaining a continuing source of supply to the company 
risk the company will be at risk from external infrastructure failures that could arise from yk failures  including failure of electrical power and telecommunications 
investigation and assessment of the risk of failure of such infrastructure is beyond the scope and resources of the company 
the company intends to rely on vendor certification of yk compliance and does not plan to audit vendor systems to test their compliance 
the company will be at risk with respect to vendors who certify their systems as being yk compliant but who are unable to deliver potentially critical supplies and services to the company on account of yk noncompliance 
business risks to the company of not successfully identifying yk issues and undertaking effective remedial action include the inability to ship product  delay or loss of revenue and delay in manufacturing operations 
the company believes that it has successfully identified critical yk issues and has substantially completed required remedial action 
other than risks created by infrastructure failures or by the company s dealings with third parties  where the actions of such third parties are beyond the company s control  the company believes that it will have no material business risk from yk issues 
there can be no assurance that infrastructure failures will not occur or that third parties  over which the company has no control will successfully address their own yk issues
