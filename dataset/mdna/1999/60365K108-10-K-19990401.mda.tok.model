the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
see language relating to forward looking statements preceding item  business 
general the company s sales and profits have been generated primarily through the sale of external pumps and related disposable products used to deliver insulin in the intensive management of diabetes 
additionally  through its acquisitions of home medical supply  inc and its affiliated companies hms and dartec in fiscal and diabetes support systems  inc dss in fiscal  the company also has broadened its product offerings to its customers to include other diabetes supplies and pharmacy products generally used in the treatment of this disease 
the company distributes these products nationally 
the hms acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests  which resulted in the operating results of the company for the years prior to the acquisition being restated to include the results of hms 
product development and manufacturing operations have focused on three product lines external pumps and related disposables  implantable insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems 
future development of the external pump and disposable product line will focus upon improving the existing technology for its current use in diabetes treatment and the utilization of this technology for the treatment of other medical conditions 
there have been no sales of glucose monitoring systems to date  however  on february   the company received a unanimous recommendation for approval of the first generation of that product from an advisory panel to the fda subject to certain conditions 
the company intends to initiate sales activity for this product line when final fda approval is received 
the company s continuous glucose monitoring system has been characterized as a first of its kind technology  and commercialization will be subject to successful implementation of manufacturing  sales  marketing and reimbursement plans 
management anticipates that this will occur by mid sales of the implantable pump have been and will continue to be irregular until full regulatory approval is obtained

these seasonal trends have resulted in sales and earnings for each of the first three quarters being significantly lower than sales in the fourth quarter 
fluctuations of earnings from quarter to quarter have and will continue to result from numerous factors  including response to practices of insurance companies and other third party payors with respect to reimbursement for the company s products  which tend to result in increased sales of the company s external infusion pumps later in the calendar year  after patients deductibles are satisfied  market acceptance of the company s products  timing of regulatory approvals  new product introductions  competition  the company s ability to manufacture its products efficiently  timing of research and development expenditures and the structure of the company s sales compensation program 
year compliance the year problem yk refers to the potential of all electronic devices containing microprocessors to improperly calculate dates in and beyond the year in the second quarter of  the company formed a year oversight committee the committee to evaluate the company s position regarding yk 
the committee consists of members representing all of the major operating and administrative departments within the company including information technology  facilities  manufacturing  research and development  regulatory  quality assurance  materials  finance and accounting and legal 
the committee established an action plan program the plan to facilitate the company s yk compliance and minimize the potential effects of yk on the company s operations 
the components of the plan include the following steps assess yk compliance of the company s products  inventory company equipment and software including non information systems equipment and software and prioritize according to critical business functions  implement yk compliance testing and remediation according to priorities developed  assess vendor and health care payor compliance  develop and implement policies to maintain yk compliance going forward  and establish contingency plans 
a timetable for the completion of each of these action steps contained in the plan has been developed by the committee 
the committee meets regularly to assess the company s efforts to comply with the plan and to address any outstanding yk issues 
the committee is also responsible for coordinating all communications and responding to all inquiries relating to yk 
the company has completed its evaluation of all of its current product offerings 
the evaluation has shown that yk will not pose operating problems for the products 
in the first quarter of the company completed the process of creating a master inventory of all equipment and software vulnerable to yk and is identifying the equipment and software attendant to critical business processes 
once this process is complete  the company will be in a position to implement remediation programs to address potential problems that are identified 
the company currently believes that it will be able to modify  replace  or mitigate its affected systems in time to avoid any material impact on its operations 
the company has initiated formal communication with its vendors to assess their compliance with yk 
questionnaires have been developed and are being distributed to vendors with on site evaluations to be conducted at the most critical vendors 
the company suspects that its greatest yk risk will be vendor compliance 
the company relies on its vendors to supply it with critical components necessary for the manufacture of its products 
a program to assess the yk compliance of insurance companies  management service organizations  and other third party payors is also being implemented 
once both the internal and external reviews described above are completed  the company will be able to design a contingency plan to address its areas of greatest exposure 
the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenario in the event of a failure to correct a material yk problem could be an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities 
such failures or interruptions could materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problem  resulting primarily from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of the company s vendors  suppliers and third party payors  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material adverse impact on the company 
the plan  implemented by the committee  is expected to significantly reduce both the company s level of uncertainty about the yk problem and the possibility of significant interruptions to normal operations 
management currently believes that the cost of yk assessment and remediation will not be material 
the company estimates that the implementation of the plan and remediation activities related to the company s internal systems and equipment will cost approximately  management currently believes that the company has adequate working capital to fund these activities
