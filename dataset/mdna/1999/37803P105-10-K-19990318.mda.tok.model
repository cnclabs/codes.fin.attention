forward looking statements include statements regarding potential acquisitions  the anticipated performance of future acquisitions  recently completed acquisitions and existing properties  and statements regarding the company s financing activities 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth below 
the limited availability of and competition for real estate acquisitions may restrict our ability to grow our growth depends  in part  upon acquisitions 
we cannot be sure that properties will be available for acquisition or  if available  that we will be able to purchase those properties on favorable terms 
the unavailability of such acquisitions could limit our growth 
furthermore  we face competition from several other businesses  individuals  fiduciary accounts and plans and entities in the acquisition  operation and sale of properties 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we do 
this competition could cause the cost of properties we wish to purchase to rise 
if we are unable to continue to grow through acquisitions  then our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
competition for tenants could adversely affect our operations when space becomes available at our properties  the leases may not be renewed  the space may not be leased or re leased  or the terms of the renewal or re lease including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than the prior lease 
we have established annual property budgets that include estimates of costs for renovation and re leasing expenses 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable in light of each property s situation  however  no assurance can be given that these estimates will sufficiently cover these expenses 
if we cannot lease all or substantially all of the space at our properties promptly  if the rental rates are significantly lower than expected  or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate  then our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
tenants defaults could adversely affect our operations our ability to manage our assets is subject to federal bankruptcy laws and state laws that limit creditors rights and remedies available to real property owners to collect delinquent rents 
if a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt  we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor in possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to that tenant 
we also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises 
if a tenant becomes bankrupt  the federal bankruptcy code will apply  which in some instances may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant 
a tenant s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
cash flow may be insufficient for debt service requirements we intend to incur indebtedness in the future  including through borrowings under our credit facility  to finance property acquisitions 
as a result  we expect to be subject to the following risks associated with debt financing including that interest rates may increase  that our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt  and that we may be unable to refinance or repay the debt as it comes due 
page debt restrictions may affect operations and negatively affect our ability to repay indebtedness at maturity our current million unsecured credit facility contains provisions that restrict the amount of distributions we can make 
these provisions provide that distributions may not exceed the lesser of i of funds from operations or ii the minimum amount that the company must distribute to its stockholders in order to avoid federal tax liability and remain qualified as a reit 
if we cannot obtain acceptable financing to repay indebtedness at maturity  we may have to sell properties to repay indebtedness or properties may be foreclosed upon  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  as of december   approximately million of our total indebtedness included secured mortgages with cross collateralization provisions 
in the event of a default  the holders of this indebtedness may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan 
this may  in turn  accelerate other indebtedness secured by these properties 
foreclosure of properties would cause a loss to us of income and asset value 
fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations as of december   we had approximately million of variable interest rate indebtedness 
accordingly  an increase in interest rates will adversely affect our net income and results of operations 
management of newly acquired properties could be difficult since the consolidation on december   and through december   we acquired approximately billion in properties 
to manage these new properties effectively  we have sought to successfully apply our experience managing our existing portfolio to expanded markets and to an increased number of properties 
the assimilation of these properties is a continuing process whose success cannot be assured indefinitely 
should we encounter future difficulties in managing these newly acquired properties  this could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions could adversely affect operations consistent with our growth strategy  we are continually pursuing and evaluating potential acquisition opportunities 
from time to time we are actively considering the possible acquisition of specific properties  which may include properties managed by gc or owned by affiliated parties 
it is possible that one or more of such possible future acquisitions  if completed  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
assumption of general partner liabilities may adversely affect operations we and our predecessors have acquired a number of properties by acquiring interests in partnerships that own the properties or by first acquiring general partnership interests and acquiring properties from the partnership at a later date 
we may pursue acquisitions in this manner in the future 
when we use this acquisition technique  a subsidiary of the company may become a general partner 
as a general partner  such subsidiary would become generally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership  including debts and obligations that may be contingent or unknown at the time of the acquisition 
in addition  the company s subsidiary assumes obligations under the partnership agreements  which may include obligations to make future contributions for the benefit of other partners 
we undertake detailed due diligence reviews to ascertain the nature and extent of obligations that the subsidiary will assume when it becomes a general partner  but we cannot be sure the obligations assumed may exceed our estimates 
also  we cannot be sure that the assumed liabilities will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and ability to service debt 
in addition  gc or another subsidiary may enter into management agreements pursuant to which it assumes certain obligations as a manager of properties 
these obligations may have an adverse effect on such subsidiary s results of operations or financial condition  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions 
potential adverse consequences of transactions involving conflicts of interest we have acquired  and from time to time may acquire  properties from partnerships that robert batinovich  our chairman and chief executive officer  and andrew batinovich  our president and chief operating officer  control  and in which they and members of their families have substantial interests 
these transactions involve or will involve conflicts of interest 
these transactions also may provide substantial economic benefits to those individuals such as page payments or issuances of partnership units in the operating partnership  relief or deferral of tax liabilities  relief of primary or secondary liability for debt  and reduction in exposure to other property related liabilities 
our policy provides that interested directors may not vote with regard to transactions in which they have a substantial interest 
these transactions may only be completed if they are approved by a majority of the disinterested directors  with the interested directors abstaining 
despite this policy and the presence of appraisals or fairness opinions or review by parties who have no interest in the transactions  the transactions will not be the product of arm s length negotiation 
these transactions may not be as favorable to us as transactions that we negotiate with unrelated parties and they could result in undue benefit to robert and andrew batinovich and members of their families 
none of these parties has guaranteed that any properties acquired from entities they control or in which they have a significant interest will be as profitable as other investments made by us or will not result in losses 
dependence on executive officers we depend on the efforts of robert batinovich  our chief executive officer and andrew batinovich  our president and chief operating officer  and of our other executive officers 
the loss of the services of any of them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financia condition 
both robert and andrew batinovich have entered into employment agreements with the company 
potential liability due to environmental matters under federal  state and local laws relating to protection of the environment environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances on the property 
these owners may be required to investigate and clean up the contamination on the property as well as the contamination which has migrated from the property 
environmental laws typically impose liability and clean up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contamination 
this liability may be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
in addition  the owner or operator of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on personal injury  property damage and or other costs  including investigation and clean up costs  resulting from environmental contamination 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses may be operated 
these restrictions may require expenditures 
under the environmental laws  any person who arranges for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of investigation or clean up of those substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
tenants of our properties generally are required by their leases to operate in compliance with all applicable environmental laws  and to indemnify us against any environmental liability arising from their activities on the properties 
however  we could be subject to environmental liability relating to our management of the properties or strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest in the properties 
also tenants may not satisfy their indemnification obligations under the leases 
we are also subject to the risk that any environmental assessments of our properties  properties being considered for acquisition  or the properties owned by the partnerships managed by gc may not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities  any prior owner or prior or current operator of such properties may have created an environmental condition not known to us  or an environmental condition may otherwise exist as to any one or more of such properties 
any one of these conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or ability to service debt  either directly with respect to our properties  or indirectly with respect to properties owned by partnerships managed by gc 
any condition adversely page affecting the financial condition of gc could adversely affect us by diminishing the value of our interest in gc 
moreover  future environmental laws  ordinances or regulations may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and ability to service debt 
also  the current environmental condition of those properties may be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of the properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us 
environmental assessments and potential liability due to asbestos containing materials environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos containing building materials 
these laws require that asbestos containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and that those who may come into contact with asbestos containing building materials be adequately informed and trained 
they also require that special precautions  including removal or other abatement  be undertaken in the event asbestos containing building materials is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
they also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
all of the properties that we presently own have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
some of the phase i environmental assessments recommended further investigations in the form of phase ii environmental assessments  including soil and groundwater sampling 
we have completed all of these investigations or are in the process of completing them 
certain of our properties have been found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
we believe that these materials have been adequately contained and we have implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
some  but not all  of the properties owned by partnerships managed by gc have been subject to phase i environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants 
gc determines on a case by case basis whether to obtain phase i environmental assessments on these properties and whether to undertake further investigation or remediation 
certain of these properties contain asbestos containing building materials 
in each case gc believes that these materials have been adequately contained and has implemented an asbestos containing building materials operations and maintenance program has been implemented for the properties found to contain asbestos containing building materials 
potential environmental liability resulting from underground storage tanks some of our properties  as well as properties that we have previously owned  are leased or have been leased to owners or operators of businesses that use  store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these businesses include dry cleaners that operate on site dry cleaning plants and auto care centers 
some of these properties contain  or may have contained  underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of those substances 
some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
several of our properties have been contaminated with these substances from on site operations or operations on adjacent or nearby properties 
in addition  certain of our properties are on  or are adjacent to or near other properties upon which others  including former owners or tenants of the properties  have engaged or may engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
environmental liabilities may adversely affect operating costs and ability to borrow the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws as well as the cost of complying with future legislation may affect our operating costs 
in addition  the presence of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances at any of our properties  or the failure to remediate those properties properly  may adversely affect our ability to borrow by using those properties as collateral 
the cost of defending against claims of liability and the cost of complying with environmental laws  including investigation or clean up of contaminated property  could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
page general risks of ownership of real estate we are subject to risks generally incidental to the ownership of real estate 
these risks include changes in general economic or local conditions  changes in supply of or demand for similar or competing properties in an area  the impact of environmental protection laws  changes in interest rates and availability of financing which may render the sale or financing of a property difficult or unattractive  changes in tax  real estate and zoning laws  and the creation of mechanics liens or similar encumbrances placed on the property by a lessee or other parties without our knowledge and consent 
should any of these events occur  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
general risks associated with management  leasing and brokerage contracts we are subject to the risks generally associated with the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses 
these risks include the risk that management contracts or service agreements may be terminated  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be renewed on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing and brokerage activity generally may decline 
in addition  our acquisition of properties from partnerships managed by gc or another subsidiary could result in a decrease in revenues to such subsidiary and a corresponding decrease in dividends received by us from such subsidiary 
each of these developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
to maintain our status as a reit while realizing income from gc s third party management business  the capital stock of gc is divided into two classes 
all of the voting common stock of gc  representing of gc s total equity  is held by individual stockholders 
nonvoting preferred stock representing the remaining equity of gc is held entirely by the operating partnership 
although the operating partnership holds a majority of the equity interest in gc  it is not able to elect gc s directors and  consequently  we have no ability to influence gc s day to day decisions 
uninsured losses may adversely affect operations we  or in certain instances  tenants of the properties  carry comprehensive liability  fire and extended coverage with respect to the properties 
this coverage has policy specification and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  certain types of losses such as from earthquakes and floods may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
further  certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity and floods 
should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake or flood  we may incur losses due to insurance deductibles  co payments on insured losses or uninsured losses 
should an uninsured loss occur  we could lose some or all of our capital investment  cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties 
this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
illiquidity of real estate may limit our ability to vary our portfolio real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and individual agreements with sellers of properties place limits on our ability to sell properties 
eighty five of our properties were acquired on terms and conditions under which they can be disposed of only in a like kind exchange or other non taxable transaction 
the agreed upon time periods for these restrictions on dispositions vary from transaction to transaction 
page potential liability under the americans with disabilities act as of january   all of our properties were required to be in compliance with the americans with disabilities act 
the americans with disabilities act generally requires that places of public accommodation be made accessible to people with disabilities to the extent readily achievable 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements could require removal of access barriers 
non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the federal government  an award of damages to private litigants and or a court order to remove access barriers 
because of the limited history of the americans with disabilities act  the impact of its application to our properties  including the extent and timing of required renovations  is uncertain 
pursuant to lease agreements with tenants in certain of the single tenant properties  the tenants are obligated to comply with the americans with disabilities act provisions 
if our costs are greater than anticipated or tenants are unable to meet their obligations  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
development alliances may adversely affect operations we may  from time to time  enter into alliances with selected developers for the purpose of developing new projects in which these developers have  in the opinion of management  significant expertise or experience 
these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
these development activities also may entail certain risks  including the risk that management may expend funds on and devote time to projects which may not come to fruition  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  the partners in development alliances may have significant control over the operation of the alliance project 
therefore  these investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks such as the possibility that the partner might become bankrupt  have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interest or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives 
consequently  actions by a partner in a development alliance might subject property owned by the alliance to additional risk 
although we will seek to maintain sufficient control of any alliance to permit our objectives to be achieved  we may be unable to take action without the approval of our development alliance partners 
conversely  our development alliance partners could take actions binding on the alliance without our consent 
in addition  should a partner in a development alliance become bankrupt we could become liable for the partner s share of the project s liabilities 
these risks may result in a development project adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
material tax risks since  we have operated as a reit under the code 
however  we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit 
to qualify as a reit we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex code provisions 
only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we receive nonqualifying management fee income and own nonqualifying preferred stock in certain subsidiaries 
as a result  we may approach the income and asset test limits imposed by the code 
there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests 
in order to avoid exceeding the asset test limit  for example  we may have to reduce our interest in our subsidiaries 
we are relying on the opinion of our tax counsel regarding our ability to qualify as a reit 
this legal opinion  however  is not binding on the internal revenue service irs 
page consequences of failure to qualify as a reit if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at corporate rates 
in addition  the company also may be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify 
this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability 
in addition  the company would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders 
even if the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
possible changes in tax laws  effect on the market value of real estate investments income tax treatment of reits may be modified by legislative  judicial or administrative action at any time 
these changes may be applied to past as well as future operations 
legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to the qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification 
in addition  the changes might also indirectly affect the market value of all real estate investments  and consequently our ability to realize our investment objectives 
additional capital requirements  possible adverse effects on holders of equity our ability to continue our growth pattern established in  which was funded largely through the raising of equity capital  depends in large part upon our ability to raise additional capital in the future on satisfactory terms 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities  or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities  the interests of holders of the company s shares of common stock could be diluted 
likewise  our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights of the preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights which may dilute or otherwise adversely affect the interests of holders of the company s shares of common stock 
if we raise additional capital through debt financing  we will be subject to the risks described below  among others 
our indebtedness restrictions may adversely affect our ability to incur indebtedness our organizational documents limit our ability to incur additional debt if the total debt  including the additional debt  would exceed of the borrowing base 
this debt limitation in our charter can only be amended by an affirmative vote of the majority of all outstanding stock entitled to vote on such amendment 
the term borrowing base is defined as the greater of fair market value or total market capitalization 
fair market value is based upon the value of our assets as determined by an independent appraiser 
total market capitalization is the sum of the market value of our outstanding capital stock  including shares issuable on exercise of redemption options by holders of units of the limited partnership  plus debt 
an exception is made for refinancings and borrowings required to make distributions to maintain our status as a reit 
in light of these debt restrictions  it should be noted that a change in the value of our common stock could affect the borrowing base  and therefore our ability to incur additional indebtedness  even though such change in the common stock s value is unrelated to our liquidity 
limitation on ownership of common stock and stockholder s rights plan may preclude acquisition of control provisions of our charter are designed to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a reit under the code by preventing concentrated ownership of the company which might jeopardize reit qualification 
among other things  these provisions provide that any transfer or acquisition of our common or preferred stock that would result in our disqualification as a reit under the code will be void  and if any person attempts to acquire shares of our common or preferred stock that after the acquisition would cause the person to own an amount of common stock and preferred stock in excess of a predetermined limit  such acquisitions would be void 
page ownership is determined by operation of certain attribution rules set out in the code 
pursuant to board action  the limit currently is of the value of the outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock the ownership limitation 
the common stock or preferred stock the transfer of which would cause any person to violate the ownership limitation  is referred to as the excess shares 
a transfer that would violate the ownership limitation will be void and the common stock or preferred stock subject to the transfer will automatically be transferred to an unaffiliated trustee for the benefit of a charitable organization designated by the board of directors until sold by the trustee to a third party or purchased by us 
this limitation on the ownership of common stock and preferred stock may preclude the acquisition of control of the company by a third party without the consent of the board of directors 
if the board of directors waives the ownership limitation for any person  the ownership limitation will be proportionally and automatically reduced with regard to all other persons such that no five persons may own more than of the value of the common stock and preferred stock 
certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may also have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for the company and may thereby inhibit a change in control in the company even if a change in control would be in the best interests of the stockholders 
in addition  in july  the board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we declared a dividend of rights on our common stock 
the rights issued under the plan will be triggered  with certain exceptions  if and when any person or group acquires  or commences a tender offer to acquire  or more of our shares 
the rights plan is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with the board of directors 
however  it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of the company  even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition  and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the company or to change existing management 
losses relating to consolidation we were created through the merger of eight partnerships and a corporation the consolidation 
prior to the consolidation  two lawsuits were filed in contesting the fairness of the consolidation  one in california state court and one in federal court 
we have been named as a defendant in each of the suits 
the complaints in both actions alleged  among other things  breaches by the defendants of fiduciary duties and inadequate disclosures 
the california state court action was settled and  upon appeal  the settlement was affirmed by the state court of appeals on february  the objectors petitioned the california supreme court for review  which was denied on may  on august   the objectors filed with the united states supreme court a petition for writ of certiorari 
on september   the defendants filed a brief in opposition to the objectors petition for writ of certiorari  and on september   the objectors filed a reply in support of their petition 
the united states supreme court has not yet ruled on the petition for writ of certiorari 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement in the california state court action  pending appeal  we have paid one third of the  settlement amount and the remaining two thirds are being held in escrow 
in the federal court action  the court in december of deferred all further proceedings pending a ruling in the california state court action 
the federal court action has been voluntarily stayed pending final outcome of the california state court action 
we believe that it is very unlikely that this litigation would result in a liability that would exceed our accrued liability by a material amount 
however  given the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot be sure that the ultimate outcomes of these actions will be favorable to us 
from time to time we are involved in other litigation arising out of our business activities 
certain other claims and lawsuits have arisen against us in our normal course of business 
it is possible that this litigation and the other litigation previously described could result in significant losses in excess of amounts reserved  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
uncertainty due to the board of directors ability to change investment policies the board of directors may change our investment policies without a vote of the stockholders 
if our investment policies change  the risks and potential rewards of an investment in the shares may also change 
in addition  the methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment techniques are developed 
page effect of market interest rates on price of common stock the annual yield on the price paid for shares of our common stock from distributions by the company may influence the market price of the shares of our common stock in public markets 
an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to seek a higher annual yield from their investments 
this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
shares available for future sale we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock or future conversions or exercises of securities for future sales will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
impact of year compliance costs on operations state of readiness 
we use a number of computer software programs and operating systems across our entire organization 
these programs and systems primarily comprise i information technology systems it systems ie  software programs and computer operating systems that serve our management operations  and ii embedded systems such as devices used to control  monitor or assist the operation of equipment and machinery systems eg  hvac  fire safety and security at our properties property systems 
to the extent that our software applications contain source code that is unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year and beyond  some level of modification or replacement of these applications will be necessary 
it systems 
employing a team made up of internal personnel and third party consultants  we have completed our identification of it systems  including hardware components  that are not yet year compliant 
to the best of our knowledge based on available information and a reasonable level of inquiry and investigation  we have completed such upgrading of such systems that we believe are called for under the circumstances  and in accordance with prevailing industry practice 
we have commenced a testing program which we anticipate will be completed during in addition  we are currently communicating with third parties with whom we do significant business  such as financial institutions  tenants and vendors  to determine their readiness for year compliance 
property systems 
employing a team made up of internal personnel and third party consultants  we have also completed our identification of property systems  including hardware components  that are not yet year compliant 
we have commenced such upgrading of such systems that we believe are called for under the circumstances  based on available information and a reasonable level of inquiry and investigation  and in accordance with prevailing industry practice 
upon completion of such upgrading  we will initiate a testing program which we anticipate will be completed during to the best of our knowledge  there are no property systems  the failure of which would have a material effect on our operations 
costs of addressing our year issues 
given the information known at this time about our systems that are non compliant  coupled with our ongoing  normal course of business efforts to upgrade or replace critical systems  as necessary  we do not expect year compliance costs to have any material adverse impact on our liquidity or ongoing results of operations 
the costs of such assessment and remediation will be paid as an operating expense 
risks of our year issues 
in light of our assessment and upgrading efforts to date  and assuming completion of the planned  normal course of business upgrades and subsequent testing  we believe that any residual year risk will be limited to non critical business applications and support hardware  and to short term interruptions affecting property systems which  if they occur at all  will not be material to our overall operations 
we believe that all of our systems will be year compliant and that compliance will not materially adversely affect our future liquidity or results of operations or ability to service debt  but we cannot give absolute assurance that this is the case 
page our contingency plans 
we are currently developing our contingency plans for all operations to address the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios regarding year compliance 
such plans  however  will recognize material limitations on our ability to plan for major regional or industrial failures such as regional power outages or regional or industrial communications breakdowns 
we expect such contingency plans to be completed during item a 
qualitative and quantitative information about market risk interest rates the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates obtainable on its mortgage loans receivable and its secured and unsecured borrowings 
the company does not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of its portfolio of mortgage loans receivable 
it is the company s policy to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
approximately and of the company s outstanding debt  including amounts borrowed under the credit facility  were subject to variable rates at december  and  respectively 
in addition  the average interest rate on the company s debt decreased from at december  to at december  the company reviews interest rate exposure in the portfolio quarterly in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the company does not have any other material market sensitive financial instruments 
it is not the company s policy to engage in hedging activities for previously outstanding debt instruments or for speculative or trading purposes 
the company may enter into forward interest rate  or similar  agreements to hedge specific anticipated debt issuances where management believes the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  the company is entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  the company makes payment in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
at december   the company was not a party to any forward interest rate or similar agreements 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date 
expected maturity date fair thereafter total value in thousands secured fixed         average interest rate secured variable     average interest rate unsecured fixed    average interest rate unsecured variable    average interest rate the company believes that the interest rates given in the table for fixed rate borrowings approximate the rates the company could currently obtain for instruments of similar terms and maturities and that the fair values of such instruments approximate carrying value at december  page
