item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including those set forth under factors affecting future results beginning on page and elsewhere in  or incorporated by reference into  this report 
overview we design  manufacture and market intelligent automation software and hardware products for assembly  material handling and packaging applications 
our products currently include machine controllers for robot mechanisms and other flexible automation equipment  machine vision systems  simulation software and a family of mechanisms including robots  linear modules  vision based flexible part feeders  as well as a line of cartesian scalable robots targeted for the electronics and assembly applications markets 
in recent years  we have expanded our robot product lines and developed advanced software and sensing technologies that have enabled robots to perform a wider range of functions 
most recently  we announced a new line of robots expressly designed for use in the semiconductor fabrication industry 
we have also expanded our channel of system integrators and our international sales and marketing operations 
as a result of these developments  the nature and composition of our revenues have changed over time 
specifically  software license and service revenues  although still relatively insignificant  have increased as a percentage of total revenues in recent periods  and international sales comprise a significant portion of our revenues 
we sell our products through system integrators  our direct sales force and original equipment manufacturers oems 
system integrators and oems add application specific hardware and software to our products  thereby enabling us to provide solutions to a diversified industry base  including the electronics  telecommunications  semiconductor  appliances  pharmaceutical  food processing and automotive components industries 
due to a worldwide slowdown in our served markets  our net revenues have declined in four of the last six fiscal quarters 
although our net revenues increased in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal compared to the respective preceding quarters  our net revenues in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal remained below the same respective periods a year ago 
accordingly  our historical results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we do not know when  or if  a sustainable recovery in our product markets will occur 
in july  we acquired bye oasis engineering  inc bye oasis  a leading manufacturer of mini and micro environment systems and standard mechanical interface smif for the microelectronics industry 
we acquired bye oasis through the issuance of  shares of our common stock which were exchanged for all of the common stock of bye oasis 
in addition  we assumed options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in the acquisition 
we intend to account for the acquisition as a pooling of interests 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flow during the three year period ended june  ie  fiscal  and 
unless otherwise indicated  references to any year in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation refer to our fiscal year ended june this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and financial statement footnotes included in this annual report on form k 
results of operations comparison of to net revenues 
our net revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in net revenues for over the prior year was primarily due to decreased product sales  including robot and motion controller sales  decreased service and upgrade revenues  offset in part by increased software revenue  primarily from our silma products 
revenue growth slowed substantially beginning in the second half of as a result of lower sales to the computer disk drive  telecommunications  semiconductor and electronics industries 
additionally  while our direct sales into the asian pacific here it iselectronics industries 
additionally  while our direct sales into the asian pacific region have been relatively insignificant to date  the widely reported economic instability in that region during fiscal adversely affected certain domestic and oem customers who saw their asian pacific revenues decline 
these revenue declines continued into fiscal and were seen throughout the markets and industries we serve 
although we experienced some improvement in our markets in the second half of fiscal  we cannot estimate when or if a sustained revival in our key hardware markets will occur 
international sales  including sales to canada and export sales  were million or of net revenues in  as compared with million or of net revenues in international sales as a percentage of total net revenues have increased due to the greater relative decline in our domestic sales in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
because international revenues constitute a significant portion of our net revenues  adverse economic conditions or instability in foreign markets where we operate directly can be expected to have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  and as noted above  fluctuations in economic conditions internationally can also affect our revenues  including domestic revenues  and operating results indirectly to the extent significant customers or industry segments on which we are significantly dependent are affected by such international fluctuations 
gross margin 
gross margin was in compared to in the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to reduced sales of lower margin hardware products  and to a lesser extent  to relatively higher margin software revenue and cost reductions on our products 
we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in gross margin percentage due to changes in our sales and product mix 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses increased by to million or of net revenues in from million or of net revenues in the absolute dollar increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in facilities and information system related expenses  offset by decreased project material spending  and travel expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in were partially offset by  of third party development funding as compared with  of third party development funding in we expect to continue to receive third party development funding from the federal government as well as other third parties during but that such funding will be less than funding received in however  any funds budgeted by the government or other third parties for our development projects may be curtailed or eliminated at any time 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million or of net revenues in from million or of net revenues in the decreased level of spending was primarily attributable to the closure of our japanese office  lower compensation related expenses  including commissions  and to a lesser extent  to lower travel expenses  reduced foreign currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement  and partially offset by an increase in outside consulting services 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was due to the relative decline in the level of net revenues 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in future periods 
restructuring and other nonrecurring charges 
we did not incur any restructuring or other nonrecurring charges in during  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million and other nonrecurring charges of approximately million 
the restructuring charges of million included  for relinquishing control of our branch in japan which resulted in the write off of certain assets and excess facilities 
we now operate in japan through a joint venture in which we have a minority interest 
the remaining  relates to severance for the termination of certain employees 
the nonrecurring charges of approximately million included  for non cash compensation expenses related to our employee stock purchase plan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and  related to the write off of certain information system hardware and software which had become obsolete 
additionally   related to the write off of the remaining balance of capitalized purchased software associated with the acquisition of silma 
due to technological changes in related to the silma operating platform  we determined the net realizable value of the purchased software was impaired 
we reported the charge of  in the second quarter of fiscal for compensation expense related to the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for increased share authorizations in an irs section employee stock purchase plan under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees which was approved by the eitf in september this nonrecurring  non cash charge represented the difference between of the fair market value of common stock on the date of the beginning of the offering period and the fair market value of common stock on the date the shareholders approved the increase in shares authorized for issuance  multiplied by the number of shares in the employee stock purchase plan espp that had been subscribed for purchase by employees  but not authorized by the shareholders  prior to the company s annual meeting of shareholders 
shareholder approval was granted to make available for issuance an additional  shares under the espp on october  we completed our restructuring plan and other nonrecurring activity in fiscal and do not have any amounts accrued for these items as of june  interest income  net 
interest income  net in was  compared to  in the decrease was primarily as a result of a higher concentration of tax advantaged investments yielding lower gross interest income 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for both and was 
our tax rates for and differ from the federal statutory income tax of primarily due to unbenefited foreign losses and foreign taxes  partially offset by the benefits of federal and state tax credits 
derivative financial instruments 
our product sales are predominantly denominated in us dollars 
however  certain international operating expenses are predominately paid in their respective local currency 
we generally do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk on local operational expenses and revenues 
although we believe that unhedged risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations for those transactions have not been material to date  there can be no assurance that such risk will not become material in the future or that we will not incur foreign exchange transaction losses which will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we make yen denominated purchases of certain components and mechanical subsystems from japanese suppliers 
based on the amount of such purchases  current exchange rate fluctuations would not typically be expected to result in material unfavorable foreign exchange transactions included in cost of revenues 
from time to time  we manage the currency risk associated with the yen denominated purchases using forward rate currency contracts 
we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts at june  comparison of to net revenues 
our net revenues increased by to million in from million in the growth in net revenues for over the prior year was primarily due to increased product sales  including robot and motion controller sales  and increased service and upgrade revenues  including revenues from our rapid deployment automation rda services group  which provides engineering contract services 
revenue growth slowed substantially in the second half of relative to the prior six month period  primarily as a result of lower sales to the computer disk drive  telecommunications  semiconductor and electronics industries 
additionally  while our direct sales into the asian pacific region have been relatively insignificant to date  the widely reported economic instability in that region has affected certain domestic and oem customers who have seen their asian pacific revenues decline 
this was a leading cause in our declining revenue for the second half of relative to the prior six month period 
international sales  including sales to canada  were million or of net revenues in  as compared with million or of net revenues in gross margin 
gross margin was in compared to in the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to improved margins on mechanism systems sales as a result of increased sales of higher margin products and  to a lesser extent  to increased service and upgrade revenues  including our new rda engineering contract services 
we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in gross margin percentage due to changes in our sales and product mix 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses increased by to million in from million in as a percentage of net revenues  research  development and engineering expenses remained at in both and the absolute dollar increase in expenses in was primarily due to increases in compensation related expenses  including consulting expenses and  to a lesser extent  to increases in facilities information system related expenses  increased project material spending  and to lower third party development funding 
research  development and engineering expenses in were partially offset by  of third party development funding as compared with  of third party development funding in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net revenues in from million or of net revenues in the increased level of spending was primarily attributable to increased headcount and compensation related expenses million and  to a lesser extent  to higher travel expenses  and information system related expenses interest income  net 
interest income  net in was  compared to  in the increase was due to higher levels of available invested funds generated primarily from operating and financing activities as well as higher investment yields in provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was compared to for our tax rates for and differ from the federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the unbenefited foreign losses and foreign taxes  partially offset by the benefits of federal and state tax credits 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on our business and financial position has not been significant to date 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had working capital of approximately million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
our cash requirements during the year ended june  were met primarily through cash provided by operations 
cash  cash equivalents and investments increased million from june  primarily as a result of million of cash generated from operating activities  offset by million of net expenditures for property and equipment  and approximately  in financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income adjusted by depreciation and amortization  decreased inventory and accounts receivable 
financing activities consisted of the repurchase of common stock offset by proceeds from employee stock option incentive and purchase plans 
in august  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prices not to exceed per share and a total purchase price not to exceed  we completed the repurchase of  shares at an average price of per share in the first and second quarters of fiscal we currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million in we believe that the existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as short term investments and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas was to be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  however  in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas defers for one year the effective date of sfas which will now apply to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we have not concluded whether the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  we have concluded adoption of this sop will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors affecting future operating results you should not rely on our past results to predict our future performance because our operating results may fluctuate 
our historical operating results may not be accurate indicators of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results have been subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in the past  and we expect this to continue in the future 
the factors that may contribute to these quarterly fluctuations in the future include fluctuations in capital spending domestically and internationally in one or more industries in which we sell our products  new product introductions by us or by our competitors  changes in product and pricing by us  our suppliers or our competitors  availability of components and raw materials for our products  our failure to manufacture a sufficient volume of products in a timely and cost effective manner  our failure to anticipate the changing product requirements of our customers  a lack of market acceptance of our products or a shift in demand for our products  changes in the mix of sales by distribution channels  changes in the spending patters of our customers  and unusual or infrequent events such as litigation or acquisitions 
our gross margins may vary greatly depending on the mix of sales of lower margin hardware products  particularly mechanical subsystems purchased from third party vendors  and higher margin software products 
our operating results may also be affected by general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending 
for example  our operations during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the first three quarters of fiscal were adversely affected by a continuing downturn in hardware purchases by customers in the electronics industry  particularly disk drive and telecommunication manufacturers 
in connection with this downturn  we were forced to affect a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of fiscal although we experienced some improvements in the markets in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we cannot estimate when or if a sustained revival in these key hardware markets will occur 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment or  for certain international sales  upon receipt of the product by the customers 
as a result  our net revenues and results of operations for a fiscal period will be affected by the timing of orders received and orders shipped during the period 
in particular  we tend to recognize a substantial portion of our revenues during the last month or weeks of a quarter 
any delay in shipments of our products  therefore  would have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we may experience such delays as a result of product development delays  problems obtaining raw materials  inability to complete transactions in our sales pipeline  or any of the other risks described in this section 
in addition  our continued investments in research and development  capital equipment and ongoing customer service and support capabilities result in significant fixed costs that we cannot reduce rapidly 
as a result  if our sales for a particular fiscal or quarterly period are below expected levels  our revenues and profits for that period would be reduced  and we could experience a loss 
in the event that in some future fiscal quarter our net revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of our common stock may fall 
we cannot assure you and we will be able to increase or sustain our profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis in the future 
because our product sales are seasonal  we may not be able to maintain a steady revenue stream 
our product sales are seasonal 
we have historically had higher bookings for our products during the june quarter of each fiscal year and lower bookings during the september quarter of each fiscal year  due primarily to the slowdown in sales to european markets and summer vacations 
in the past  we have attempted to maintain revenue levels during the september fiscal quarter by filling backlog from the june fiscal quarter 
if our backlog at the end of the june fiscal quarter is reduced as a result of lower bookings in the june quarter or is otherwise insufficient to compensate for lower bookings in the september fiscal quarter  our revenues and operating results for the september fiscal quarter and future quarters would be reduced 
for example  our net revenues decreased as a result of reduced product bookings in each of the three fiscal quarters ending march  in addition  during fiscal as a whole  our net revenues were adversely affected by a decline in orders from customers in the disk drive and telecommunications markets 
in addition  you should not rely on our backlog as a useful measure of anticipated activity or future revenues 
the orders constituting our backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances are subject to cancellation without significant penalty by the customer 
we have in the past experienced changes in delivery schedules and customer cancellations that resulted in our revenues in a given quarter being materially less than would have been anticipated based on backlog at the beginning of the quarter 
we expect that these delivery changes and order cancellations may adversely affect our revenues in future quarters 
a significant percentage of our product shipments occur in the last month of each fiscal quarter 
historically  this has been due in part  at times  to our inability to forecast the level of demand for our products or of the product mix for a particular fiscal quarter 
to address this problem we periodically stock inventory levels of completed robots  machine controllers and certain strategic components 
if shipments of our products fail to meet forecasted levels  our revenues would be decreased and we would have increased our operating expenses in anticipation of unrealized increases in sales of our products 
sales of our products depend on the capital spending habits of our customers  which tend to be cyclical 
intelligent automation systems using our products can range in price from  to several million dollars 
accordingly  our success depends directly on the capital expenditure budgets of our customers 
our future operations may be subject to substantial fluctuations because of domestic and foreign economic conditions  industry patterns and other factors affecting capital spending 
although the majority of our international customers are not in the asian pacific region  we believe that recent instability in the asian pacific economies had a material adverse effect on our operations as a result of a reduction in sales by our customers to those markets 
domestic or international recessions or a downturn in one or more of our major markets  such as the electronics  telecommunications  semiconductor  appliances  pharmaceutical  food processing or automotive components industries  and resulting cutbacks in capital spending would have a direct  material adverse impact on our business 
many of the key components and materials of our products come from single source suppliers  and their procurement requires lengthy lead times 
we obtain many key components and materials and some significant mechanical subsystems from sole or single source suppliers with whom we have no guaranteed supply arrangements 
in addition  some of our sole or single sourced components and mechanical subsystems incorporated into our products have long procurement lead times 
our reliance on sole or single source suppliers involves several significant risks  including the following loss of control over the manufacturing process  potential absence of adequate supplier capacity  potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  materials or mechanical subsystems  and reduced control over manufacturing yields  costs  timely delivery  reliability and quality of components  materials and mechanical subsystems 
if any significant sole or single source supplier were unable or unwilling to manufacture our components  materials or mechanical subsystems in the volumes and timeframes we require  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
the process of qualifying suppliers may be lengthy  and additional sources may not be available to us on a timely basis  on acceptable terms  or at all 
if supplies of these items were not available from our existing suppliers and a relationship with an alternative vendor could not be developed in a timely manner  shipments of our products could be interrupted and we could be required to reengineer our products 
in the past  we have experienced quality control or specification problems with key components provided by sole source suppliers and have had to design around the particular flawed item 
we have also experienced delays in filling customer orders due to the failure of our suppliers to meet our volume and schedule requirements 
some of our suppliers in the past have also ceased manufacturing components that we require for our products  and we have been required to purchase sufficient supplies for the estimated life of our product line 
problems of this type with our suppliers may occur in the future 
disruption or termination of our supply sources could require us to seek alternative sources of supply and could delay our product shipments and damage relationships with current and prospective customers 
any of these events could result in an increase in our expenses  reductions in our revenues and profits and could result in net losses 
if we incorrectly forecast product mix for a particular period and we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of any components or mechanical subsystems on a timely basis due to long procurement lead times  our business and operating results would be substantially impaired 
moreover  if demand for a product for which we have purchased a substantial amount of components fails to meet our expectations  we would be required to write off the excess inventory 
a prolonged inability to obtain adequate timely deliveries of key components would also impair our business and results of operations 
any problems we encounter integrating bye oasis engineering inc into our business could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results 
we recently completed the acquisition of bye oasis engineering inc bye oasis is a manufacturer of contamination control systems and standard mechanical interfaces for semiconductor fabrication facilities  a business in which we have no operational experience 
this acquisition will require us to integrate two geographically separated companies that previously operated independently  and we have limited experience with integration of acquired companies 
we may encounter difficulties integrating our product offerings and operations with those of bye oasis 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully market bye oasis s products or develop any new products as a result of the acquisition 
the public announcement of our acquisition of bye oasis could result in suppliers  distributors  or customers of bye oasis canceling or otherwise terminating their arrangements with bye oasis 
if we fail to achieve the product  marketing  distribution  and other operational benefits and efficiencies we originally anticipated in the merger  we will have overpaid for the acquisition  and our shareholders will have experienced substantial dilution without off setting benefits 
we face intense competition in the market for intelligent automation products 
the market for intelligent automation products is highly competitive 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are product functionality and reliability  customer service  price  and product features such as flexibility  programmability and ease of use 
we compete with a number of robot companies  motion control companies  machine vision companies and simulation software companies 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
in addition  we may in the future face competition from new entrants in one or more of our markets 
many of our competitors in the robot market are integrated manufacturers of products that produce robotics equipment internally for their own use and may also compete with our products for sales to other customers 
some of these large manufacturing companies have greater flexibility in pricing than we have because they generate substantial unit volumes of robots for internal demand 
they may have access through their parent companies to large sources of capital 
any of our competitors may seek to expand their presence in other markets in which we compete 
our current or potential competitors may develop products comparable or superior in terms of price and performance features to those developed by us 
they may also adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
we may be required to make substantial additional investments in connection with our research  development  engineering  marketing and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat  or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
we expect that in the event the intelligent automation market expands  competition in the industry will intensify  as additional competitors enter our markets and current competitors expand their product lines 
increased competitive pressure could result in a loss of sales or market share  or cause us to lower prices for our products  any of which could harm our business 
our principal competitors in the us robot market include us subsidiaries of the japanese companies fanuc ltd  seiko instruments  yamaha corporation  sony corporation  sankyo company limited  and other japanese robot companies 
in the european robot market  we principally compete with robert bosch gmbh  which to date has sold most of its products in germany  and with fanuc  seiko  yamaha  sony  sankyo  and other japanese companies 
in the japanese robot market  over a dozen robot companies compete with us  including fanuc  nippon denso  panasonic company  sankyo  seiko  sony and yamaha 
some of these large manufacturing companies have greater flexibility in pricing than we have because they generate substantial unit volumes of robots for internal demand and may have access through their parent companies to large sources of capital 
in addressing the japanese market  we are at a competitive disadvantage as compared to japanese suppliers  many of whom have long standing collaborative relationships with japanese manufacturers 
because of this competitive disadvantage  we closed our japanese subsidiary in the fall of and now operate through a joint venture in japan 
although we expect to continue to invest significant resources in the japanese market in the future  we may not be able to achieve significant sales growth in the japanese intelligent automation market 
our principal competition in the semiconductor atmospheric wafer handling and contamination control market comes from asyst technologies  inc the majority of asyst s revenue comes from adaptive standard mechanical interface  or smif  devices sold to end users 
they have been the leader in smif and isolation technology in the semiconductor industry 
additional competitors in the semiconductor robot market are brooks automation  inc and equipe  a division of pri automation  inc our principal competitors in the market for motion control systems include allen bradley co  a subsidiary of rockwell international corporation  in the united states  and siemens ag in europe 
in addition  we face motion control competition from two major suppliers of motion control boards  galil motion control  inc and delta tau data systems  inc 
these motion control boards are purchased by end users which engineer their own custom motion control systems 
in the simulation software market our competitors include tecnomatix technologies  inc  an israel based company which sells mostly to major automotive manufacturers  and deneb robotics inc  a subsidiary of dassault systemes 
in the machine vision market  we face competition from cognex corporation  and robotic vision systems inc we may not be able to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and new product development that characterize the intelligent automation industry 
the intelligent automation industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
our ability to remain competitive and our future success depend greatly upon the technological quality of our products and processes relative to those of our competitors 
in addition  we must continue to develop new and enhanced products and to introduce these new products at competitive prices and on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing and manufacturing new products or in enhancing our existing products on a timely basis or at all 
our new or enhanced products may not achieve market acceptance 
if we cannot successfully develop and manufacture new products  timely enhance our existing technologies  or meet customers technical specifications  our products could lose market share  our revenues and profits could decline  or we could experience operating losses 
new technology or product introductions by our competitors could also cause a decline in sales or loss of market share for our existing products or force us to significantly reduce the prices of our existing products 
from time to time  we have experienced and will likely continue to experience delays in the introduction of new products 
we have experienced and may continue to experience technical and manufacturing difficulties and delays in future introductions of new products and enhancements 
any failure by us to develop  manufacture and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenues from existing products or to manage product and related inventory transitions successfully could harm our business 
our success in developing  introducing  selling and supporting new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including timely and efficient completion of hardware and software design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes and effective sales  marketing and customer service 
because of the complexity of our products  significant delays may occur between a product s initial introduction and commencement of volume production 
the development and commercialization of new products involve many difficulties  including the following the identification of new product opportunities  the retention and hiring of appropriate research and development personnel  the definition of the product s technical specifications  the successful completion of the development process  the successful marketing of the product  the risk of having customers embrace new technological advances  additional customer service costs associated with supporting new product introductions  and additional customer service costs required for field upgrades 
for example  we are currently in the process of releasing our new digital workcell  semiconductor robots and production pilot 
these products include significant new networking  communications  and hardware and software technology 
the development of these products may not be completed in a timely manner and these products may not achieve acceptance in the market 
the development of these products has required  and will require  that we expend significant financial and management resources 
if we are unable to continue to successfully develop these or other new products that respond to customer requirements or technological changes  our business and operating results may be harmed 
our software products may contain defects that could harm our reputation and future business prospects 
new or existing software products or enhancements may contain errors or performance problems when first introduced  when new versions or enhancements are released  or even after products or enhancements have been used in the marketplace for a period of time 
despite our testing  product defects may be discovered only after a product has been installed and used by customers 
errors and performance problems may be discovered in future shipments of our products 
these errors could result in expensive and time consuming design modifications or large warranty charges  damage customer relationships and result in loss of market share  any of which could harm our reputation and future business prospects 
in addition  increased development and warranty costs would reduce our operating profits and could result in losses 
we rely on systems integrators to sell our products 
we believe that our ability to sell products to system integrators will continue to be important to our success 
a substantial portion of our sales are to system integrators that specialize in designing and building production lines for manufacturers 
many of these companies are small operations with limited financial resources  and we have from time to time experienced difficulty in collecting payments from certain of these companies 
as a result  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
from time to time  because we do not require collateral  we may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or to provide a letter of credit 
we provide reserves for potential credit losses  and to date losses of this type have been within our expectations 
to the extent we are unable to mitigate this risk of collections from system integrators  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
our relationships with system integrators are generally not exclusive  and some of our system integrators may expend a significant amount of effort or give higher priority to selling products of our competitors 
in the future  any of these system integrators may discontinue their relationships with us or form additional competing arrangements with our competitors 
although to date none of our system integrators has accounted for a material percentage of our net revenues  the loss of  or a significant reduction in revenues from  system integrators to which we sell a significant amount of our product could result in a material reduction in our revenues and a reduction in our operating results 
as we enter new geographic and applications markets  we must locate system integrators to assist us in generating sales in those markets 
we may not be successful in obtaining effective new system integrators or in maintaining sales relationships with them 
if a number of our system integrators experience financial problems  terminate their relationships with us or substantially reduce the amount of our products they sell  or if we fail to build an effective systems integrator channel in any new markets  our revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
our presence in international markets exposes us to risk 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues  however  we cannot assure you that international sales will increase or that the current level of international sales will be sustained 
net revenues from international sales  including sales to canada  have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues 
international sales were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and this represented   and of net revenues for the respective periods 
we also purchase some components and mechanical subsystems from foreign suppliers 
as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales and purchases  which include the following different regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  transportation delays  foreign currency fluctuations  export import controls  tariff regulations  higher freight rates  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  duty  tariff and freight costs can materially increase the cost of crucial components for our products 
foreign exchange fluctuations may render our products less competitive relative to locally manufactured product offerings  or could result in foreign exchange losses 
moreover  because substantially all of our foreign sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the dollar relative to the local currency would increase the price of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive and less price competitive than competitors products that are priced in local currencies 
any of these factors may result in a reduction in our revenues and a decrease in our earnings we anticipate that past turmoil in asian financial markets and the deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain asian countries may continue to have an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose projects are based in those countries 
specific factors that may affect us include the impact of currency fluctuations on the relative price of the our products and restrictions on government spending imposed by the international monetary fund on those countries receiving the international monetary fund s assistance 
in addition  customers in those countries may face reduced access to working capital to fund capital expenditures due to higher interest rates  reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or the deterioration in the customer s or bank s financial condition  or the inability to access local equity financing 
we make yen denominated purchases of certain components and mechanical subsystems from japanese suppliers 
depending on the amount of yen denominated purchases  we may engage in hedging transactions in the future 
however  notwithstanding these precautions  we remain subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the date a foreign currency export sale or purchase transaction is recorded and the date cash is received or payments are made in foreign currencies 
we cannot assure you that our current or any future currency exchange strategy will be successful in avoiding exchange related losses or that any of the factors listed above will not impair our business or operating results 
if our hardware products do not comply with standards set forth by the european union  we will not be able to sell them in europe 
our hardware products are required to comply with european union low voltage  electro magnetic compatibility  and machinery safety directives 
the european union mandates that our products carry the ce mark denoting that these products are manufactured in strict accordance to design guidelines in support of these directives 
these guidelines can change and are subject to varying interpretation 
new guidelines impacting machinery design go into effect each year 
to date  we have retained tuv rheinland to help certify that our controller based products  including some of our robots  meet applicable european union directives and guidelines 
although our existing certified products meet the requirements of the applicable european union directives  we cannot assure you that future products can be designed  within market window and financial constraints  to meet the future requirements 
in the event any of our robot products or any other major hardware products do not meet the requirements of the european union directives  we would be unable to legally sell these products in europe 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be impaired 
if we do not comply with environmental regulations  our business may be harmed 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  and disposal of certain hazardous substances used in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with all material environmental regulations in connection with our manufacturing operations  and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
however  our failure to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to a variety of consequences that could harm our business  including the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  and alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with environmental regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses 
our failure to control the use  disposal  removal  or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liabilities under certain statutes 
the imposition of liabilities of this kind could harm our financial condition 
we could lose revenues and incur significant costs if our systems  the systems of our customers or third party systems that we use are not year compliant 
we may experience significant problems and costs associated with year compliance that could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
in fiscal  we commenced a program  to be substantially completed by the fall of  to review the year compliance status of the software and systems used in our internal business processes  to obtain appropriate assurances of compliance from the manufacturers of these products  and to obtain an agreement to modify or replace all non compliant products 
we have contacted our critical suppliers and major customers to determine whether the products obtained from such vendors or sold by the customer to third parties are year compliant 
our suppliers and customers are under no contractual obligation to provide such information to the company 
in addition  we have implemented at our san jose headquarters the initial phase of a year compliant enterprise resource planning system from a third party vendor and are also considering converting certain of our other software and systems to commercial products that are known to be year compliant 
additionally  in europe  we are in the process of upgrading our management information systems 
we have been advised by the third party suppliers of these systems and upgrades that the upgrades will render our european management information systems year compliant 
implementation of software products of third parties  however  will require the dedication of substantial administrative and management information resources  the assistance of consulting personnel from third party software vendors and the training of our personnel using such systems 
based on the information available to date  we believe we will be able to complete our year compliance review and make necessary modifications prior to the end of calendar year software or systems which are deemed critical to our business are scheduled to be year compliant by the end of calendar year nevertheless  particularly to the extent we rely on the products of other vendors to resolve year issues  there can be no assurances that we will not experience delays in implementing such products 
if key systems  or a significant number of systems were to fail as a result of year problems  or we were to experience delays implementing year compliant software products  we could incur substantial costs and disruption of our business  which would potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in the ordinary course of our business  we test and evaluate our own software products 
we believe that our software products are generally year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not materially affect the performance of our software products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability of these products to correctly create  store  process and output information related to such date data 
to the extent our software products are not fully year compliant  our software products may not contain all necessary software routines and codes necessary for the accurate calculation  display  storage and manipulation of data involving dates 
to the extent that our products are sold through system integrators or other third parties  our products may experience year problems as a result of the integration of our software with noncompliant year products of such third party suppliers 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we have warranted that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance of the company s products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability to create  store  process and output information related to such data 
if any of our licensees experience year problems  these licensees could assert claims for damages against us 
to date  we have not identified a complete and separate budget for investigating and remedying issues related to year compliance whether involving our own software products or the software of systems used in our internal operations 
we have incurred costs of approximately million and expect to incur in total  approximately million in connection with our implementation of a new enterprise resource planning software system and upgrades for other systems at our san jose headquarters and in our european offices  which is year compliant 
additionally  we are currently in the process of developing a contingency plan related to year our resources spent on investigating and remedying year compliance issues will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to handle the introduction of the single european currency 
we are in the process of addressing the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency  or the euro  as of january  and transition to full adoption as of january  our internal systems that are affected by the initial introduction of the euro were euro capable as of january  we do not presently expect that the introduction and use of the euro will materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging activities  or our use of derivative instruments  or will result in any material increase in costs to us 
while we will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction over time  based on currently available information  management does not believe that the introduction of the euro currency will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
the success of our business depends on our key employees 
we are highly dependent upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  and product development personnel 
in particular  we would be materially adversely affected if we were to lose the services of brian carlisle  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors  who has provided significant leadership to the company since our inception  or bruce shimano  vice president  research and development and a director  who has guided our research and development programs since our inception 
in addition  the loss of the services of any of our senior managerial  technical or sales personnel could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers and do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of our key personnel 
our future success also heavily depends on our continuing ability  to attract  retain  and motivate highly qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
competition for qualified technical personnel in the intelligent automation industry is intense 
our inability to recruit and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis would adversely affect our ability to design  manufacture  market and support our products 
we are subject to the risks associated with acquisitions 
from time to time  we may consider the acquisition of companies or technologies that management believes may complement or extend our current products  businesses  or technologies 
in the last three years  we have made some acquisitions of various sizes  including the recent acquisition of bye oasis 
in the future we may make material acquisitions of  or large investments in  other businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that management believes will further our strategic objectives 
any future acquisitions or investments we might make would present risks commonly associated with these types of transactions  including difficulty in combining the technology  operations  or work force of the acquired business  o disruptions of our on going businesses  difficulties in realizing our potential financial and strategic position through the successful integration of the acquired business  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  difficulty in obtaining preferred acquisition accounting treatment  potential negative impact in results of operations due to amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired  and the diversion of management attention 
the risks described above  either individually or in the aggregate  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we expect that future acquisitions  if any  could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and common stock 
our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may significantly impair our competitive advantage 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property are adequate  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot be certain that patent and copyright law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our technology  that any patents issued to adept will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us  or that the claims under any patent application will be allowed 
we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and there can be no assurance that patents will issue from currently pending or future applications or that our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors 
these claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
we may face costly intellectual property infringement claims 
we have from time to time received communications from third parties asserting that we are infringing certain patents and other intellectual property rights of others or seeking indemnification against such alleged infringement 
as claims arise  we evaluate their merits 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  damages for infringement  and the need to obtain a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies 
such license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  some end users of our products have notified us that they have received a claim of patent infringement from the jerome h 
lemelson foundation  alleging that their use of our machine vision products infringes certain patents issued to mr 
lemelson 
in addition  we have been notified that other end users of our adeptvision vme line and the predecessor line of multibus machine vision products have received letters from the lemelson foundation which refer to mr 
lemelson s patent portfolio and offer the end user a license to the particular patents 
some of our end users have notified us that they may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses resulting from this matter 
we cannot predict the outcome of this or any similar litigation which may arise in the future 
litigation of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment policy which ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents principal cash flow amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
fair total value in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate    average rate auction rate securities fixed rate    average rate auction rate preferred variable rate    average rate total investment securities    average rate we mitigate default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
we conduct business on a global basis 
as such  we are exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency commitments and balance sheet positions 
the realized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and offset against realized and unrealized gains and losses when the transaction occurs 
at june  there were no outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts
