form k page impact of year the year issue arose because many existing computer programs use a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to refer to a year 
these programs  if not corrected  could fail or create erroneous results after the century date changes on january   or when otherwise dealing with dates later than december  this year issue is believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations  including the company 
since the company has been evaluating  assessing and adjusting all known date sensitive systems and equipment for year compliance 
the scope of this effort includes internally developed information technology it systems  purchased and leased software  embedded systems  and electronic data interchange transaction processing 
the company also instituted and maintains strict policies regarding standards for all network servers and software  desktop and laptop computers  operating systems  desktop software and applications  and communication routers and hubs 
the monitoring of year risks has significantly enhanced the company s readiness enabling the quick deployment and testing of compliant hardware and software as it is developed 
in the company initiated a year compliance committee which inventoried internally developed production systems and identified those and the data files which needed to be modified 
in all package software applications were evaluated to determine which were not year compliant and a plan was developed for either updating or eliminating these applications 
also evaluated to determine year readiness were all computer hardware and operating systems including as s  risc s  tandems  servers  pc s and cash registers 
the evaluation phase of the year project is substantially complete and included both it  such as noted above  and non it equipment  such as warehouse sortation and security systems 
substantially all of the company s operating it systems are year compliant and based on the assessment efforts to date  the company does not believe that the year issue will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  all situations cannot be anticipated and  there can be no assurance of timely compliance by third parties  such as utility companies  government agencies or merchandise suppliers  which may have an adverse effect on the company 
the company operates a large number of geographically dispersed stores and procures its merchandise for resale and supplies for operational purposes from a vast network of vendors located both within and outside the united states 
the company is not dependent on any one vendor for more than of its merchandise purchases 
the established relationships with key vendors are a valued asset  however  substitute products for most of the goods available for sale in the closeout stores may be obtained from other vendors 
if certain vendors are unable to deliver product on a timely basis  due to their own year issues  it is anticipated others would be capable to deliver similar goods 
approximately of the company s merchandise is imported  and any significant disruptions in the global transportation industry  including a delay in the processing of merchandise through customs  could cause a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company intends to allocate internal resources and retain dedicated consultants as necessary to be ready to take action if these events occur 
to date  the company has not established a formal contingency plan for possible year issues 
where needed  the company will establish contingency plans based on actual testing experience and assessment of outside risks 
it is expected that any formal contingency plans will be in place by july  the company has incurred to date approximately million of costs to implement its year compliance program and presently expects to incur not more than million of additional costs in the aggregate 
all of the company s year compliance costs have been or are expected to be funded from the company s operating cash flow 
the company s year compliance budget does not include material amounts for hardware replacement because the company has historically employed a strategy to continually upgrade its mainframe and midrange form k page computer systems and to update systems with respect to both preexisting operations and in conjunction with the acquisitions and mergers effected by the company in recent years 
consequently  the company s year budget has not required the diversion of funds from or the postponement of the implementation of other planned it projects 
the cost of the conversions and the completion dates are based on management s best estimates and may be updated as additional information becomes available
