the company s actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  among others  that the markets for the company s products  including but not limited to chameleon unix link  chameleon hostlink  onnet host  onweb host  supportnow  opsession  ns portfolio and ns router  could grow more slowly than the company or market analysts believe or that the company will not be able to compete effectively in those markets

in connection with the acquisition of ftp  the company allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and  in management s opinion  the in process research and development had no probable alternative future use

netvision  an internet service provider in israel  for million  and recognized a gain of million 
in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of relay technology  inc relay  a privately held company  for million in cash 
relay was primarily engaged in the development  marketing and support of network connectivity  file transfer and terminal emulation software

in july  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of maximum information  inc  a california corporation maxinfo  in exchange for approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests during the third quarter of the operations of maxinfo  however  were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position and  therefore  the historical financial statements have not been restated to reflect the acquisition retroactively 
accordingly  the operations of maxinfo from the date of acquisition forward have been recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during the past year  the company has taken several initiatives intended to control costs and reduce operating expenses  including the discontinuance of several low revenue generating products and the initiation of a restructuring plan in the third quarter of the company also focused on integrating the technologies acquired as a result of its acquisitions of ftp  netsoft and relay in august  july and november  respectively  with the company s product offerings

visual connectivity products add value to the pc connectivity product offerings and also target new market segments 
current products include demonow  supportnow and opsession  real time software tools that help reduce the length of support phone calls from end users 
for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  the company experienced an increase in net revenues and a decrease in net loss 
the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to the company s expanded product offerings as a result of the inclusion of sales of ftp s products from the date of acquisition forward  the company s acquisitions of netsoft and relay  the release of unixlink hostlink late in the second quarter of and the growth in sales for supportnow 
however  the company continues to experience pricing pressures on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that revenues will increase at the same rate  or at all  in future periods 
see factors that may affect future results and financial condition marketing and distribution below 
because the company generally ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any one quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s operating expense levels are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
operating expenses  excluding the write off of in process research and development  have decreased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  compared to as a result of the restructuring plans initiated in the third quarters of and and the resulting reduction of headcount and the closing and or consolidation of facilities 
operating expenses are expected to remain relatively constant throughout and may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues as the company completes its integration of ftp into its operations and develops and introduces new products which may contribute more significantly to revenue 
while the company continues to adjust its operations to address these issues  there can be no assurance that net revenues or net income will stabilize or improve in the future 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change dollars in millions net revenues license fees services total net revenues as a percentage of net revenues license fees services total net revenues gross margin as a percentage of net revenues research and development as a percentage of net revenues sales and marketing as a percentage of net revenues general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues write off of in process research and development as a percentage of net revenues restructuring charge as a percentage of net revenues interest income as a percentage of net revenues equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliate as a percentage of net revenues unrealized gain on investment in unconsolidated affiliate n a as a percentage of net revenues gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated affiliate n a as a percentage of net revenues provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate n a n a net loss net revenues historically  substantially all of the company s net revenues have been derived from software license fees 
service revenues have been primarily attributable to maintenance agreements associated with product licenses 
license fees increased both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in license fees was primarily attributable to the inclusion of ftp s revenues from the date of acquisition forward  integration of new products from the company s acquisitions of netsoft and relay  the release of unixlink hostlink late in the second quarter of and growth in product sales for supportnow  this increase was partially offset by a decline in sales of the company s chameleon products 
the increase in service revenues in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to primarily reflects the growth in the customer base as a result of the aforementioned increase in licenses 
the company has operations worldwide with sales offices located in the united states  europe  israel and japan 
international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was due to the integration of ftp products  particularly in europe  with the company s product lines in the international marketplace 
the company continues to integrate the sales and distribution efforts of the combined company 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be completed expeditiously or successfully 
software license fees are generally recognized as revenue upon shipment if the fee is considered fixed and determinable  the arrangement does not include significant customization of the software and collectibility is probable 
allowances for returns and doubtful accounts are provided based on historical rates of returns and write offs  which have not been material to date 
certain of the company s sales to distributors are under agreements providing rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise 
accordingly  the company defers recognition of such sales until the merchandise is sold by the distributor 
the company provides ongoing maintenance and support to its customers  generally under annual service agreements 
maintenance and support is comprised of software updates for existing products and telephone support 
service revenues are recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of such agreements 
periodically  the company has provided training and consulting services to selected customers 
revenue from such services is recognized as the related services are performed and has not been material to date 
the company does not expect that revenues generated from such training and consulting services will become materially significant in the future 
no customer accounted for more than of net revenues during the years ended december  and gross margin cost of revenues primarily includes royalties paid to third parties for licensed software incorporated into the company s products  costs associated with product packaging  documentation and software duplication and the amortization and write down of purchased software 
gross margin  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  increased between the years ended december  and primarily as a result of the change in the mix of products sold and significant cost savings obtained from the outsourcing of manufacturing activities beginning in the third quarter of cost of service revenues through december  has not been material and is not reported separately 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may fluctuate in the future due to increased price competition  the mix of distribution channels used by the company  the mix of license fee revenues versus service revenues  the mix of products sold and the mix of international versus domestic revenues 
the company typically recognizes higher gross margins on direct sales than on sales through indirect channels of distribution  which carry lower margins 
in  ftp s products  which are sold through lower margin indirect channels  will be included in the company s results for the entire year 
research and development research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  occupancy and travel expenses  and fees paid to outside consultants 
the decrease in r d expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues for as compared to primarily reflects cost savings  particularly in r d salaries and benefits  associated with the reduction in headcount resulting from the recent restructuring plans announced in the third quarters of and as well as the company s continued efforts to control operating expenses 
the company expects that r d spending in absolute dollars will remain relatively constant for and  as a percentage of revenues  will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels  acquisitions and licensing of technology 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  under which the company is required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility is established  which the company defines as a working model and further defines as a beta version of the software 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross product revenue  estimated economic life and changes in technology 
costs that do not qualify for capitalization are charged to r d expense when incurred 
to date  internal software development costs that were eligible for capitalization have not been significant and the company has charged all internal software developments costs to r d expense as incurred 
sales and marketing sales and marketing s m expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions of sales and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional expenses and customer service and support costs 
the decrease in s m expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily reflects declines in s m salaries and benefits related to employee attrition and the and restructurings discussed above and reduced advertising expenses  partially offset by increased commissions expense due to the sales growth in the company believes that s m expenses will increase significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues during as the company launches new products which will be based on the integration of the technologies of ftp with those of the company  which will require additional advertising and promotion activities 
the company expects that s m expenses during as a percentage of total net revenues will fluctuate depending on future revenue levels 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to an increase in g a salary expense as a result of the netsoft and ftp acquisitions as well as increased legal expenses associated with defending the lawsuits discussed in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has taken steps to address the growth in g a expenses through the restructuring plan announced in august and the company believes that g a expenses will decrease slightly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues throughout no assurance can be given that the restructuring will prove to be successful  that future operating results will improve  or that the actions undertaken in the restructuring will not disrupt the company s remaining operations 
further  there can be no assurance that additional reorganization of the company s operations will not be required in the future 
write off of in process research and development as previously discussed  in connection with the acquisitions of all of the outstanding shares of ftp  nsa and relay during the third quarter of and the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  the company acquired a total of million in and million in of intangible assets and purchased technology 
of this amount  million in and million in were reflected as a charge to operations for the write off of in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and  in management s opinion  had no probable alternative future use 
these charges were reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company allocates values to in process research and development based on an assessment of research and development projects 
the values assigned to those assets are limited to significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on the risk adjusted cash flow of incomplete projects 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet the company s design requirements  including functions  features  and technical and economic performance requirements 
restructuring charge as discussed above  in the third quarters of and  the company initiated plans to restructure its operations worldwide 
in august  the company announced and initiated a plan to restructure its worldwide operations as a result of business conditions and in connection with the integration of the operations of ftp 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a million charge to operating expenses and also assumed a million restructuring liability in connection with the acquisition of ftp in the third quarter of the two restructuring plans included a reduction in the company s worldwide workforce  reduction of office space and closure of domestic and international locations 
the company completed the majority of the restructuring actions by the end of and expects to complete the remaining items within one year from the date the restructuring plan was initiated 
the company anticipates that the execution of the restructuring plan will require cash expenditures of million  which will be funded from internal operations 
as of december   the company had incurred costs totaling approximately million relating to restructuring  requiring million in cash expenditures 
in the third quarter of  the company initiated a plan to restructure its worldwide operations due to business conditions and a need to focus solely on its core competencies 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a million charge to operating expenses in the third quarter of this plan included a reduction in workforce  closure of international locations and elimination of certain unprofitable product lines 
as of december   the company had incurred costs totaling approximately million related to the restructuring 
the remaining restructuring actions were completed in the year ended december  and required cash expenditures of approximately million 
interest income the decline in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is the result of a decrease in cash balances in prior to the acquisition of ftp 
this was due to the cash used to fund operations  cash requirements for restructuring activities and an adjustment to interest income to convert ftp s investments from available for sale to held to maturity 
the reductions were partially offset by increases in the company s cash and investments following the acquisition of ftp and the sale of the company s interest in netvision 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliate and unrealized gain on investment in unconsolidated affiliate in december  the company sold its equity interest in netvision for million 
the company s ownership interest prior to the sale was approximately 
in connection with this transaction  the company recorded a gain on the sale of its netvision stock of million  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  provision for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of approximately million  which consisted primarily of foreign taxes for the gain realized on the sale of its interest in netvision and an increase to the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax asset 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a tax benefit of approximately million 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on the company generating sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax asset  however  could be reduced in the near term if actual future taxable income differs from estimated amounts

further  the timing of the netsoft and relay acquisitions and the release of the company s chameleon hostlink product prevented these events from contributing significantly to revenues during the year ended december  the increase in service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to primarily reflects the decline in the total net revenues base as a result of the aforementioned decline in license fee revenues 
international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was due largely to the company s lack of success in marketing and selling its products in  particularly in europe and japan  the latter of which accounted for the majority of the company s international revenues during no customer accounted for more than of net revenues during the years ended december  and gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of net revenues  increased between the years ended december  and primarily as a result of decreased packaging and documentation costs as well as the inclusion of a charge in of million for the amortization and write down of purchased software 
the write off of purchased software primarily resulted from the company s decision during the fourth quarter of to discontinue its chameleonnfs for mac os and xoftware for mac os product lines 
amounts incurred for the amortization and write down of purchased software in were immaterial 
cost of service revenues through december  was not material and was not reported separately 
research and development the decrease in r d expenses in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is primarily the result of cost savings  particularly r d salaries and benefits  associated with employee attrition during and the previously discussed restructuring 
the decline in the total net revenues base resulted in the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to sales and marketing the decrease in s m expenses in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year primarily reflects cost savings related to employee attrition during and the restructuring and the resulting declines in s m salaries and benefits  as well as a decline in advertising in as the company re evaluated its marketing and selling strategies 
as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  the increase in s m expenses was attributable to the decreased total net revenues base 
general and administrative g a expenses decreased in absolute dollars for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to cost savings related to employee attrition during and the restructuring 
as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  the increase in g a expenses was attributable to the decreased total net revenues base in write off of in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of netsoft and relay during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  the company acquired a total of million of intangible assets 
of this amount  million was reflected as a charge to operations for the write off of in process research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and  in management s opinion  had no probable alternative future use 
this charge is reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased technology from applicom software industries ltd 
and us computer software  inc in management s opinion  neither of these purchased technologies had reached technological feasibility nor had a probable alternative future use 
accordingly  these technology purchases  totaling approximately million  were deemed to be in process research and development and were charged to operations for the year ended december  restructuring charge as discussed above  in the third quarter of  the company initiated a plan to restructure its operations worldwide

no such charges were incurred for the year ended december  interest income the decline in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the prior year is primarily the result of a decrease in aggregate cash and investments from million at december  to million at december  the increase in interest income as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to is attributable to the decreased total net revenues base in equity in income loss of unconsolidated affiliate and unrealized gain on investment in unconsolidated affiliate in december  netvision issued an additional  preferred shares which were sold to tevel israel international communications  ltd tevel  an unrelated party  for million cash in exchange for a one third interest in netvision

year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computers systems as the millennium year approaches 
the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to the risk for the company exists in four areas as follows systems used by the company to run its business  systems used by the company s suppliers  potential warranty or other claims from the company s customers  and the potential reduced spending by other companies on networking solutions as a result of significant information systems spending on year remediation 
for the year non compliance issues identified to date  the cost of testing  upgrade  and remediation of the company s internal systems is approximately million 
the company is conducting an ongoing review of its estimated costs  the preliminary investment required for the necessary upgrades and remediation for replacement of certain computer systems is estimated at  the company expects to implement upgrades and remediations prior to the end of if implementation of such systems is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company is contacting its critical suppliers to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year compliant 
where practicable  the company will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of suppliers to be year ready 
if suppliers are not year compliant  the company may seek alternative sources of supplies 
however  such failures remain a possibility and could have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company believes its current products are year compliant  however  all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving third party products 
the cost of the additional testing of third party product functionality as recommended by the company s year task force is expected to be approximately  for these reasons  the impact of customer claims on the company s results of operations or financial condition cannot be determined at this time 
customers whose computer systems and applications may require significant hardware and software upgrades or modifications may plan to devote a substantial portion of their information systems spending to fund such upgrades and modifications and divert spending away from networking solutions 
such changes in customers spending patterns could have a material adverse impact on the company s sales  operating results or financial condition 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition significant fluctuations in operating results the company has experienced  and expects to experience in future periods  significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors including  among others  demand for the company s products  introduction or enhancements of products by the company or its competitors  technological changes in computer networking  competitive pricing pressures  market acceptance of new products  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products and product enhancements  the size and timing of individual product orders  mix of international and domestic revenues  mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  impact of  or failure to enter into  strategic alliances to promote the company s products  quality control of products  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
in addition  the company s acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies may cause fluctuations in operating results due to in process research and development charges  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and integration costs  in each case such as those recorded in connection with the acquisition of ftp 
because the company generally ships software products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any one quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter and particularly in the last month of that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and to a large extent are fixed 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s operating results and on the company s ability to achieve profitability 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
based on the foregoing  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
restructuring  integration of operations of ftp in late august  following its acquisition of ftp  the company initiated a plan to restructure its worldwide operations in response to adverse business conditions and in connection with the integration of the operations of ftp 
the restructuring plan involves both a reduction in the company s worldwide workforce and the consolidation of certain of the company s sales and research and development facilities 
the majority of the restructuring actions were complete as of december  no assurance can be given that the restructuring will prove to be successful  that future operating results will improve  or that the completion of the restructuring will not disrupt the company s operations 
further  there can be no assurance that additional reorganization of the company s operations will not be required in the future 
in addition  the company continues to integrate the operations of ftp 
as indicated below under risks of acquisitions  the successful combination of companies in the rapidly changing software industry requires coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts and may be more difficult to accomplish than in some other industries 
the integration of ftp has involved the integration of geographically separated organizations in suburban boston  massachusetts  cupertino and irvine  california  and haifa  israel and personnel with diverse business backgrounds and corporate cultures 
the company believes that such factors  the attention and dedication of management and other resources required to effect the integration and the disruption in the business of ftp resulting from the announcement and consummation of the acquisition may have contributed to an interruption and loss of momentum in ftp s business activities  and that the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues from the sale of ftp s products will depend in part on its ability to effectively respond to these factors 
risks of acquisitions the company s merger and acquisition transactions  including the recent acquisition of ftp  have been motivated by various factors  including the desire to obtain new technologies  expand and enhance the company s product offerings  attract key personnel and strengthen the company s presence in the international and oem marketplace 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including the diversion of management s attention away from day to day operations  difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations and personnel such as sales  engineering and customer support  the integration of acquired products with existing product lines  the failure to realize anticipated benefits in terms of cost savings and synergies  undisclosed liabilities  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets  the potential loss of key employees from acquired companies and the difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
the company regularly evaluates product and technology acquisition opportunities and anticipates that it may make additional acquisitions in the future if it determines that an acquisition would further its corporate strategy 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by the company will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect the company or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the company s business 
if the operations of an acquired company or business do not meet the company s expectations  the company may be required to restructure the acquired business or write off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business 
changes in personnel the majority of the company s employee workforce is located in the extremely competitive employment markets of the silicon valley and orange county in california  the suburban boston area and haifa  israel 
during the latter half of and throughout and  the company and  prior to the acquisition  ftp experienced high attrition at all levels and across all functions of the company 
the attrition experienced by the company was attributable to various factors including  among others  industry wide demand exceeding supply for experienced engineering and sales professionals  the effects of the company s and restructurings and acquisitions and the company s results of operations during managing employee attrition  integrating acquired operations and products and expanding both the geographic areas of its customer base and operations have resulted in substantial demands on the company s management resources and increases the difficulty of hiring  training and assimilating new employees 
any failure of the company to retain and attract qualified employees or to train or manage its management and employee base could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
product development and competition the market for the company s products is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customers needs and frequent new product introductions 
from time to time over the past three years  many customers have delayed purchase decisions due to the confusion in the marketplace relating to rapidly changing technology and product introductions 
to maintain or improve its position in this industry  the company must continue to successfully develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company has experienced difficulty from time to time in developing and introducing new products and enhancing existing products in a manner which satisfies customer requirements and changing market demands 
any further failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to develop on a timely basis products or product enhancements incorporating new functionality could cause customers to delay purchase of the company s current products or cause customers to purchase products from the company s competitors  either situation would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis  or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
because certain of the company s products incorporate software and other technologies developed and maintained by third parties  the company is  to a certain extent  dependent upon such third parties ability to enhance their current products  to develop new products that will meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis  and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party technologies currently offered in conjunction with its products if those technologies become unavailable to it or obsolete or incompatible with future versions of the company s products or market standards 
for example  substantially all of netmanage s net revenues have been derived from the sales of products that provide internetworking applications for the microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of certain of the company s products would be materially adversely affected by developments adverse to microsoft or windows 
in addition  the company s strategy of developing products based on the windows operating environment is substantially dependent on its ability to gain pre release access to  and to develop expertise in  current and future windows developments by microsoft 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to provide on a timely basis products compatible with future windows releases 
the company s ability to internally develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
see changes in personnel above 
in addition to internal development of new products and technologies  the future success of the company may depend on the ability of the company to enter into and implement strategic alliances and oem relationships to develop necessary products or technologies  to expand the company s distribution channels or to jointly market or gain market awareness for the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying or developing such alliances and relationships or that such alliances and relationships will achieve their intended purposes 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products or product enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments  which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
such loss or delay could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s connectivity software products compete with major computer and communication systems vendors  including microsoft  ibm  novell and sun microsystems  inc  as well as smaller networking software companies such as hummingbird communications ltd 
the company also faces competition from makers of terminal emulation software such as attachmate corporation  wall data  inc and wrq  inc 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name or product recognition and a larger customer base  than the company 
the market for the company s products is characterized by significant price competition and the company anticipates that it will face increasing pricing pressures from its current and new competitors in the future 
moreover  given that there are low barriers to entry into the software market and that the market is rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change  the company believes that competition will persist and intensify in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide new products that compare favorably with the new products of the company s competitors or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices 
the company has experienced price declines for its products in and any further material reduction in the price of the company s products would require the company to increase unit sales in order to maintain revenues at existing levels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in doing so 
the company s competitors could seek to expand their product offerings by designing and selling products using technology that could render obsolete or adversely affect sales of the company s products 
these developments may adversely affect the company s sales of its own products either by directly affecting customer purchasing decisions or by causing potential customers to delay their purchases of the company s products 
several of the company s competitors have developed proprietary networking applications and certain of such vendors  including novell  provide a tcp ip protocol suite in their products at little or no additional cost 
in particular  microsoft has embedded a tcp ip protocol suite in its windows and windows nt operating systems 
the company has products which are similar to connectivity products marketed by microsoft 
microsoft is expected to increase development of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
euro currency the single european currency euro was introduced on january  with complete transition to this new currency required by january the company has assessed the issues raised by the introduction and made changes to its internal systems in connection with the initial introduction of the euro 
any delays in the company s ability to be euro compliant could have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company expects that introduction and use of the euro will affect the company s foreign exchange and hedging activities  and may result in increased fluctuations in foreign currency hedging results 
marketing and distribution historically  the company has relied significantly on its independent distributors  systems integrators and value added resellers for certain elements of the marketing and distribution of its products 
the agreements in place with these organizations are generally non exclusive 
these organizations are not within the control of the company  may represent other product lines in addition to those of the company and are not obligated to purchase products from the company 
there can be no assurance that such organizations will give a high priority to the marketing of the company s products  and such organizations may give a higher priority to other products  which may include those of the company s competitors 
actions of this nature by such organizations could result in a lower sales effort being applied to the company s products and a consequent reduction in the company s operating results 
the company s results of operations can also be materially adversely affected by changes in the inventory strategies of its resellers  which can occur rapidly and in many cases may not be related to end user demand 
as part of its continued strategy of selling through multiple distribution channels  the company expects to continue its use of indirect distribution channels  particularly value added resellers and system integrators  in addition to distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
indirect sales may grow as a percentage of both domestic and total revenues during and beyond  as a result of the acquisition of ftp or to increase market penetration 
any material increase in the company s indirect sales as a percentage of revenues may adversely affect the company s average selling prices and gross margins due to the lower unit costs that are typically charged when selling through indirect channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain resellers and distributors who will be able to market the company s products effectively  will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service or will continue to represent the company s products  and any inability on the part of the company to recruit or retain important resellers or distributors could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
proprietary rights the company relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company seeks to protect its software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection  and  to a lesser extent  patent laws 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult and  while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the number of patents applied and granted for software inventions is increasing 
consequently  there is a growing risk of third parties asserting patent claims against the company 
the company has received  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties asserting that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  seeking indemnification against such infringement or indicating that the company may be interested in obtaining a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any of such claims would not result in protracted and costly litigation 
if any claims or actions were to be asserted against the company and it were required to seek a license of a third party s intellectual property  there can no assurance that it would be able to acquire such a license on reasonable terms or at all  and no prediction can be made about the effect that such a license might have on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
should litigation with respect to any such claim commence  such litigation could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
global market risks the company derived approximately of net revenues from international sales during the year ended december  while the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net revenues  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the company s products or that the company s distributors will be able to effectively meet that demand 
risks inherent in the company s international business activities generally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  the limitations imposed by us export laws see government regulation and legal uncertainties below  changes in markets caused by a variety of political  social and economic factors  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  difficulties in managing international operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences  repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international sales and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the recent financial difficulties of some international economies could result in reduced revenue from sales to customer locations in such areas 
year compliance the company currently estimates that it will incur expenses of up to million in connection with the upgrade and remediation of non critical internal computer systems and testing of its software products for compliance with year however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to implement these upgrades successfully  and the company s estimates of expenses may be incorrect due to unknown defects in its systems 
if the company s review of its year readiness did not uncover all year problems and the company does not have a contingency plan to address this risk and it could suffer  be adversely affected  or be required to expend additional resources to resolve those problems 
see liquidity and capital resources year compliance above 
in addition  many of the company s products are designed to function with legacy systems  many of which may not be year compliant 
failures of these legacy systems to be year compliant may reduce demand for the company s products and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company is also relying on assurances from suppliers that they and their products are prepared for the year however  there can be no assurance that statements from vendors are reliable  since the company has not independently investigated its vendors assertions about their products 
any failure to be year compliant on the company s vendors or customers could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
government regulation and legal uncertainties the company is not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that various laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy  pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s products  increase the company s cost of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
further  due to the encryption technology contained in certain of the company s products  such products are subject to us export controls 
there can be no assurance that such export controls  either in their current form or as may be subsequently enacted  will not limit the company s ability to distribute products outside of the united states or electronically 
while the company takes precautions against unlawful exportation  there can be no assurance that inadvertent violations will not occur  and the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to effectively control the distribution of the company s products 
in addition  future federal or state legislation or regulation may further limit levels of encryption or authentication technology 
any such export restriction  new legislation or regulation or unlawful exportation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
litigation the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently parties to class action lawsuits filed by holders or former holders of each company s common stock 
see note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries will be able to prevail in the lawsuits or that adverse outcomes in one or more of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
quarterly financial information the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly financial information for the company s last eight quarters 
this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the company has experienced  and expects to experience in future periods  significant fluctuations in operating results that may be caused by many factors  including  among others  those described above within factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
the company s future revenues and results of operations could be subject to significant volatility and may also be unpredictable due to shipment patterns typical of the software industry 
a significant percentage of the company s revenues are generally recognized in the third month of each quarter and tend to occur in the latter half of that month 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
