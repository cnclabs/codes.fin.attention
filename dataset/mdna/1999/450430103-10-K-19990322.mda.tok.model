item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts general since its inception in the company has experienced substantial growth through acquisitions 
due to the magnitude of these acquisitions and the integration of the acquired operations with the company s existing businesses and results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily comparable with or indicative of results of operations for current or future periods 
the company discontinued its low margin fabrication operations during and  and adopted plans to discontinue the filtration group operations in september with its eventual sale expected in the company s results of operations are affected by certain conditions outside the company s control  including overall industrial economic conditions and specifically the demand for hydrocarbon processing products and services 
additionally  recent low oil prices and the oversupply of certain commodity chemicals have adversely affected many of the company s customers in the refining and petrochemical industries 
the downturn in the asian market has reduced export opportunities and to a limited degree increased domestic competition from foreign equipment producers 
certain petrochemical and refining customers deferred equipment purchases related to certain major projects during the second half of that reduced demand for some of the company s products 
these factors have increased pricing pressure on new equipment resulting in a decline in the company s gross margins and operating profits in however  refinery and plant utilization remains near capacity and management believes that the intermediate and long term prospects for the sale of the company s equipment  parts and services to the hydrocarbon processing industry remain strong 
the company s results of operations for the year ended december  were also adversely affected by conditions relating to the company s business combination following the october merger with astrotech 
on november   the company announced actions to restructure its management organization  reduce its underlying cost structure and refocus the company s efforts on providing superior customer service 
these actions include a multi step strategic plan designed to enhance future operations which was developed based on an in depth review of the company s operations and systems 
this included replacing certain management personnel 
management also determined effective september   that the filtration group was non core and decided to dispose of this business unit 
the filtration group has been treated as a discontinued operation and is currently for sale

under this method  the company recognizes as revenues that portion of the total contract price which the cost of work completed to date bears to the estimated total cost of the work included in the contract 
because contracts may extend over more than one fiscal period  revisions of cost and profit estimates are made periodically and are reflected in the accounting period in which they are determined 
if the estimate of total costs on a contract indicates a loss  the total anticipated loss is recognized immediately 
contract costs include all direct material  labor and subcontracting costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as supplies  tools and repairs

revenue is recognized under this method when a project is substantially complete 
the contracts accounted for under this revenue recognition method are typically less than three months in duration 
the company historically has experienced quarterly fluctuations in its operating results

the company s general working capital requirements consist of salary costs and related overhead and the purchase price of materials and components  and may also include subcontract costs incurred prior to the receipt of corresponding progress payments under the contract with respect to which such costs are incurred 
management anticipates that the company will make capital expenditures of approximately  in as compared to  in in november  the company amended its principal credit agreement to increase its maximum borrowings in conjunction with the ohmstede acquisition 
the financing consisted of a  term loan and a  revolving line of credit facility 
in may  iteq sold approximately  shares of common stock and used the net proceeds approximately  to reduce debt 
in addition to the bank financing  in november  the company issued senior subordinated notes subordinated notes to two institutional lenders in an aggregate amount of  the subordinated notes were scheduled to mature november   and bore interest at an initial rate of 
as additional consideration  the subordinated note holders received warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at per share  subject to adjustment

the company obtained an amendment to this agreement on december  at december   the company was in compliance with the provisions of its loan agreement 
except with respect to funding any future acquisitions  management believes that cash generated from operations  existing cash balances and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet iteq s anticipated cash requirements for management further believes that iteq could obtain additional capital to make acquisitions primarily through either issuances of common or preferred stock  or debt or lease financing  however  such financing may not be available when required or on terms acceptable to iteq 
year issue iteq is facing the year issue which arises from the past practice of utilizing two digits as opposed to four to represent the year in some computer programs and software and could result in computational or operational errors as dates are compared across the century boundary 
the year problem could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of the operations of iteq  its vendors and its customers 
iteq has developed a multi phase plan to resolve potential year problems relating to its information technology it systems and embedded chip technology contained in certain of its facilities and a limited number of products it produces  including identifying and evaluating all it systems and embedded chip technology according to their potential business impact  identifying it systems and embedded chip technology that use date functions and assessing them for year functionality  reprogramming or replacing equipment systems  where necessary  to ensure year readiness  testing the code modifications and new equipment systems to ensure successful operation in a post environment  and adoption of contingency plans in the case of potential year failures 
iteq currently has identified the it systems and embedded chip technology utilizing date functions and assessing them for year compliance 
iteq expects remediation of most of its critical systems and embedded chip technology to be completed by june  iteq relies on numerous third party vendors and suppliers for a wide variety of goods and services  including raw materials  banking  telecommunications and utilities such as water and electricity 
many of iteq s operations would be adversely affected if these supplies and services were curtailed as a result of a supplier s year noncompliance 
iteq is currently contacting its third party vendors to ensure that they have an effective plan in place to address the year problem 
iteq  however  has received little information from these vendors to date and does not have sufficient information to assess whether its external relationships will be year ready 
iteq intends to make further communications with those vendors who do not respond to iteq 
iteq currently estimates that its year costs will not exceed  most of which will be incurred in certain of these costs may or may not be recurring 
iteq expects cash flow from operations to be sufficient to fund these expenditures 
if iteq s year issues were unresolved  potential consequences would include  among other possibilities  the inability to accurately and timely process customers orders  process financial transactions  bill customers  or report accurate data to management  shareholders  customers  and others as well as business interruptions or shutdowns  financial losses  and litigation related to year issues 
iteq is developing contingency recovery plans aimed at ensuring the continuity of critical business functions before and after december  as part of that process  iteq plans to develop reasonably likely failure scenarios for its critical it systems and external relationships and the embedded systems in its critical facilities 
once these scenarios are identified  iteq will develop plans that are designed to reduce the impact on iteq  and provide methods of returning to normal operations  if one or more of those scenarios occur 
iteq cannot guarantee that it will be able to resolve all of its year issues 
iteq expects contingency recovery planning to be substantially complete by september  information regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical facts included in the preceding discussion regarding iteq s financial position  business strategy  and plans of management for future operations are forward looking statements 
although iteq believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct
