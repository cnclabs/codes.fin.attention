page item a market risk disclosures 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions the market risk associated with the company s market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates and commodities prices 
interest the fair market value of the company s long term debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowings 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  assuming current incremental borrowing rates of interest  was million as of august   representing an excess of approximately million over the carrying value 
the company s market risk has been calculated as the possible increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one point change in interest rates 
the market risk associated with a one point change in interest rates is approximately  commodities the availability and price of corn  the company s most significant raw material  is subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  domestic and foreign governmental farm programs and policies  changes in global demand and the worldwide production of corn 
the company generally follows a policy of hedging corn purchases related to fixed price sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations 
the instruments used are principally readily marketable exchange traded futures contracts  which are designated as hedges 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to changes in the price of corn 
to obtain a proper matching of revenue and expense  gains or losses arising from hedging transactions are included in inventories as a cost of the raw material and reflected in earnings when the related sale is made 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its raw material position 
the company s net commodity position consists primarily of inventories and purchase contracts and exchange traded futures contracts which hedge fixed sales commitments 
the fair value of the position is based on quoted market prices 
the company has estimated its market risk as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
as of august   the fair value of the company s net corn position was approximately million 
the market risk associated with a adverse change in corn prices is estimated at  actual results could differ from this analysis
