see information regarding forward looking statements 
general the company operates within three operating business segments pharmaceutical distribution  pharmaceutical services  and medical surgical products 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of these segments 
results of operations operating revenue 
operating revenue for fiscal increased as compared to the prior year due to strong operating revenue growth in all three of the company s business segments 
the majority of the overall operating revenue increase approximately for the year ended june  came from existing customers in the form of increased volume and pharmaceutical price increases 
the remainder of the growth came from the addition of new customers 
the pharmaceutical distribution segment s operating revenue representing of total operating revenue  including approximately million sold to owen  eliminated in consolidation grew at a rate of during the fiscal year ended june  primarily due to strong sales to pharmacy chain stores and through the company s specialty distribution businesses 
the pharmaceutical services segment s operating revenue representing of total operating revenue grew at a rate of during fiscal  primarily on the strength of the company s pharmacy automation and pharmaceutical packaging businesses 
the company s pharmacy automation business continued to see solid growth in the us hospital sector and increased demand from non acute care customers 
the pharmaceutical packaging business growth in fiscal was attributable to a mix of new customers and an increase in volume from existing customers 
the medical surgical products segment s operating revenue representing of total operating revenue for fiscal year grew over the prior year primarily due to strong sales of self manufactured surgical products and best value distributed supplies

the medical surgical products segment s operating revenue representing of total operating revenue for fiscal year grew over the prior year 
the majority of the overall operating revenue increase approximately for the year ended june  came from existing customers in the form of increased volume and pharmaceutical prices 
the remainder of the growth came from the addition of new customers 
bulk deliveries to customer warehouses 
the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries made to customers warehouses  whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and subsequent delivery of pharmaceutical products 
fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from circumstances that are beyond the control of the company  including consolidation within the customers industries  decisions by customers to either begin or discontinue warehousing activities  and changes in policies by manufacturers related to selling directly to customers 
due to the lack of margin generated through bulk deliveries  fluctuations in their amount have no significant impact on the company s earnings 
gross margin 
for fiscal and  overall gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was and  respectively 
the pharmaceutical distribution segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the impact of lower selling margins  as a result of a highly competitive market and a greater mix of high volume customers  where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management enable the company to offer lower selling margins to its customers 
the pharmaceutical services segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was and in fiscal and  respectively 
operating revenue growth in the pharmaceutical services segment has been greater in the relatively higher margin pharmacy automation and pharmaceutical packaging businesses than it has been in the lower margin pharmacy management business 
the medical surgical products segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of improvements in the company s product mix  including the growth of self manufactured product sales in both domestic and international markets as well as the impact of manufacturing and other cost efficiencies 
for fiscal and  gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was and  respectively 
the pharmaceutical distribution segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower selling margins  as a result of a highly competitive market and a greater mix of high volume customers  where a lower cost of distribution and better asset management enabled the company to offer lower selling margins to its customers

the medical surgical products segment s gross margin as a percentage of operating revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of improvements in the company s product mix  including the growth of manufactured product sales in both domestic and international markets as well as the impact of manufacturing and other cost efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue declined to for fiscal compared to in fiscal the improvements during fiscal reflect economies associated with the company s revenue growth  in addition to significant productivity gains resulting from continued cost control efforts in all three segments and the continuation of consolidation and selective automation of operating facilities in the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical services segments 
pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical services segments selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue were and in fiscal  respectively  compared to and in fiscal  respectively 
offsetting these improvements was an increase in the selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in the medical surgical products segment which increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of businesses having a higher selling  general and administrative rate than the medical surgical products segment s normal rate during fiscal these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as such  historical financial statements have not been restated 
the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses experienced in fiscal year  compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases in personnel costs and depreciation expense  and compares favorably to the growth in operating revenue during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenue improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the improvements in fiscal reflect the economies associated with the company s revenue growth  as well as significant productivity gains resulting from continued cost control efforts and the consolidation and selective automation of operating facilities 
the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses experienced in the fiscal year  compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases in personnel costs and depreciation expense  and compares favorably to the growth in operating revenues during fiscal special charges merger related charges 
costs of effecting mergers and subsequently integrating the operations of the various merged companies are recorded as merger related costs when incurred 
during fiscal  merger related costs totaling million million  net of tax were recorded 
of this amount  approximately million related to transaction and employee related costs  and million related to business restructuring and asset impairment costs associated with the company s merger transactions with scherer and allegiance 
as part of the business restructuring  the company is currently closing certain facilities 
as such  the company has incurred employee related and asset impairment costs  as well as  exit costs  related to the termination of contracts and lease agreements 
in addition  the company recorded costs of million related to the write down of impaired inventory related to a previous merger and of million related to severance costs for restructuring associated with the change in management that resulted from the merger transaction with owen 
the company also recorded costs of million related to integrating the operations of companies that previously engaged in merger transactions with the company 
partially offsetting the charge recorded was a million credit  to adjust the estimated transaction and termination costs previously recorded in connection with the canceled merger transaction with bergen brunswig corporation bergen see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this adjustment relates primarily to services provided by third parties engaged by the company in connection with the terminated bergen transaction 
the cost of such services was estimated and recorded in the prior periods when the services were performed 
actual billings were less than the estimate originally recorded  resulting in a reduction of the current period merger related costs 
during fiscal  the company recorded merger related charges associated with transaction costs incurred in connection with the mediqual merger transaction million and in connection with the proposed merger transaction with bergen million which was terminated subsequent to year end see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
additional costs related to asset impairments million and integrating the operations of companies that previously merged with the company million were incurred and recorded during fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded merger related charges associated with the pci and owen merger transactions million and additional integration costs related to the pyxis and medicine shoppe mergers million 
see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company classifies costs associated with a merger transaction as merger related costs 
it should be noted that the amounts presented may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
other special charges 
during fiscal  the company recorded a special charge of million related to the rationalization of its pharmaceutical distribution operations 
approximately million related to asset impairments and lease exit costs resulting primarily from the company s decision to accelerate the consolidation of a number of distribution facilities and the relocation to more modern facilities for certain others 
the remaining amount related to employee severance costs  including approximately million incurred in connection with the settlement of a labor dispute with former employees of the company s boston pharmaceutical distribution facility  resulting in termination of the union relationship 
during fiscal  scherer  along with its joint venture partner  converted the legal ownership structure of scherer s owned subsidiary in germany from a corporation to a partnership 
as a result of this change in tax status  the company s tax basis in the german subsidiary was adjusted  resulting in a one time tax refund of approximately million  as well as a reduction in the cash taxes to be paid in the current and future years 
combined  these factors reduced fiscal income tax expense by million 
the following is a summary of the special charges incurred by the company in the last three fiscal years fiscal year ended june  in millions  except per share amounts merger related costs transaction and employee related costs transaction costs pci vested retirement benefits and incentive fee employee severance termination other total transaction and employee related costs fiscal year ended june  other merger related costs asset impairments exit and restructuring costs duplicate facilities elimination integration and efficiency implementation total other merger related costs total merger related costs other special charges facilities closures employee severance total other special charges total special charges tax effect of special charges tax benefit for change in tax status effect on net earnings effect on diluted earnings per share the effects of the merger related costs and other special charges are included in the reported net earnings of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal and in the reported diluted earnings per common share of in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the company estimates that it will incur additional merger related costs associated with the various merger transactions it has completed to date totaling approximately million million  net of tax in future periods in order to properly integrate operations  of which a portion represents facility rationalizations  and implement efficiencies with regard to  among other things  information systems  customer systems  marketing programs and administrative functions 
such amounts will be charged to expense when incurred 
asset impairments in fiscal include the write off of a patent million and the write down of certain operating assets million related to meditrol  inc meditrol  a subsidiary acquired by the company in the owen merger transaction as a result of management s decision to merge the operations of meditrol into pyxis and phase out production of the separate meditrol product line 
the company s trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand its role as a provider of services to the healthcare industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas which a complement the company s core pharmaceutical distribution business  b provide opportunities for the company to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired business  and c generally generate higher margins as a percentage of operating revenue than pharmaceutical distribution 
as the healthcare industry continues to change  the company is constantly evaluating merger or acquisition candidates in pharmaceutical distribution  as well as related sectors of the healthcare industry that would expand its role as a service provider  however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  the company would incur additional merger related costs 
interest expense 
the increase in interest expense of million during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the company s issuance of million of notes due  in a public offering in july see liquidity and capital resources 
the effect of the issuance of the notes during fiscal has been partially offset by a decrease in other debt instruments with higher interest rates 
the million decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the paydown of the company s million of notes on march  and a reduction in the overall interest rate on total debt outstanding during fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the company s provision for income taxes relative to pretax earnings was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the tax rate is primarily due to the impact of recording certain non deductible merger related costs during various periods as well as fluctuating state and foreign effective tax rates as a result of the company s business mix for all three fiscal years 
also  a change in tax status of a owned german subsidiary resulted in a lower tax provision during fiscal liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to billion at june  from billion at june  this increase resulted from additional investments in inventories and trade receivables of million and million  respectively 
offsetting the increases in working capital was an increase in accounts payable of million and a decrease in cash of million 
increases in inventories reflect the higher level of business volume in pharmaceutical distribution activities  especially in the fourth quarter of fiscal when distribution revenue grew over the same period in the prior year 
the increase in trade receivables is consistent with the company s revenue growth see operating revenue above 
the change in accounts payable and cash is due primarily to the timing of inventory purchases and related payments 
on july   the company issued million of notes due  the proceeds of which were used for working capital needs due to growth in the company s business 
the company currently has the capacity to issue million of additional debt securities pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment  at cost  increased by million at june  compared to june  the increase was primarily due to ongoing plant expansion and manufacturing equipment purchases and additional investments made for management information systems and upgrades to distribution facilities 
the company has several operating lease agreements for the construction of new facilities 
see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
shareholders equity increased to billion at june  from billion at june   primarily due to net earnings of million and the investment of million by employees of the company through various stock incentive plans  offset by the retirement of million of allegiance treasury shares 
the company has line of credit agreements with various bank sources aggregating million 
the company had million outstanding under these lines at june  in addition  the company has a commercial paper program  providing for the issuance of up to million in aggregate maturity value of commercial paper 
the company had million outstanding under this program at june  the company has an unsecured bank credit facility  which provides for up to an aggregate of billion in borrowings of which million is part of a multi currency allocation and million represents a day facility 
as of june   million of borrowings were outstanding under the multi currency allocation portion of the facility 
the company believes that it has adequate capital resources at its disposal to fund currently anticipated capital expenditures  business growth and expansion  and current and projected debt service requirements  including those related to business combinations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives thereof  including foreign currency hedging instruments 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in speculative transactions involving derivative financial instruments

on august   the company and bergen jointly terminated the bergen merger agreement and  in accordance with the terms of the bergen merger agreement  the company reimbursed bergen for million of transaction costs 
additionally  the termination of the bergen merger agreement caused the costs incurred by the company that would not have been deductible had the merger been consummated to become tax deductible for federal income tax purposes  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
the obligation to reimburse bergen and the additional tax benefit were recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year project 
the company utilizes computer technologies in each of its businesses to effectively carry out its day to day operations 
computer technologies include both information technology in the form of hardware and software  as well as embedded technology in the company s facilities and equipment 
similar to most companies  the company must determine whether its systems are capable of recognizing and processing date sensitive information properly in the year the company is utilizing a multi phased concurrent approach to address this issue 
the first of two project segments  mitigation and validation  included specific awareness  assessment  remediation  validation and implementation phases 
the company has substantially completed all of these phases of this project segment 
the company has corrected  replaced  mitigated  or retired the vast majority of those business critical systems which were not year ready in order to ensure the company s ability to continue to meet its internal needs and those of its suppliers and customers 
the company expects that all remaining mitigation and validation issues will be fully completed on or before september  this process includes the multiple testing of critical systems to ensure that year readiness has been accomplished 
the second project segment  business protection  also includes several phases business dependency and risk assessment  contingency planning  and situation management planning 
the company has made significant and substantial progress with this segment and expects to substantially complete the business dependency and risk assessment phase by august  and the remaining two phases by september  the company currently believes it will be able to modify  replace  or mitigate its affected systems in time to avoid any material detrimental impact on its operations 
if the company determines that it is unable to remediate and properly test affected systems on a timely basis  the company intends to develop appropriate contingency plans for any such mission critical systems at the time such determination is made 
while the company is not presently aware of any significant probability that its systems will not be properly remediated on a timely basis  there can be no assurances that all year remediation processes will be completed and properly tested before the year  or that contingency plans will sufficiently mitigate the risk of a year readiness problem 
the company estimates that the aggregate costs of its year project will be approximately million  including costs incurred to date 
significant portions of these costs were not incremental costs  but rather represented the redeployment of existing resources 
this reallocation of resources is not expected to have a significant impact on the day to day operations of the company 
since the initiation of the year project  the company estimates that it has incurred costs of approximately million of which approximately million represented incremental costs 
the anticipated impact and costs of the project  as well as the date  on which the company expects to complete the project  are based on management s best estimates using information currently available and numerous assumptions about future events 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
based on its current estimates and information currently available  the company does not anticipate that the costs associated with this project will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has formally communicated with its significant suppliers  customers  and critical business partners to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly remediate their own year issues 
the company has taken steps to monitor the progress made by those parties  and intends to test critical system interfaces as the year approaches 
the company is in the process of developing appropriate contingency plans in the event that a significant exposure is identified relative to the dependencies on third party systems 
although the company is not presently aware of any such significant exposure  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties on which the company relies or with which the company interfaces will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to properly convert by a third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the potential risks associated with the year issues include  but are not limited to temporary disruption of the company s operations  loss of communication services and loss of other utility services 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would be a loss of communication services which could result in problems with receiving  processing  tracking and billing customer orders  problems receiving  processing and tracking orders placed with suppliers  and problems with banks and other financial institutions 
currently  as part of the company s normal business contingency planning  a plan has been developed for business disruptions due to natural disasters and power failures 
the company is in the process of enhancing these contingency plans to include provisions for year issues  although it will not be possible to develop contingency plans for all potential disruption 
although the company anticipates that minimal business disruption will occur as a result of the year issues  based upon currently available information  incomplete or untimely resolution of year issues by either the company or significant suppliers  customers and critical business partners could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the euro conversion 
on january   certain member countries of the european union irrevocably fixed the conversion rates between their national currencies and a common currency  the euro  which became their legal currency on that date 
the participating countries former national currencies will continue to exist as denominations of the euro until january  the company has addressed the business implications of conversion to the euro  including the need to adapt internal systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions  the competitive implications of cross border price transparency  and other strategic implications 
the company does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

the impact of interest rate swaps is not significant 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange 
the company conducts business in several major international currencies 
the company periodically uses financial instruments  principally foreign currency options to attempt to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on earnings 
in addition  the company periodically enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge certain exposures related to selected transactions that are relatively certain as to both timing and amount and to hedge a portion of the production costs expected to be denominated in foreign currency 
the purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations and cash flows 
gains and losses on the hedging activities are recognized concurrently with the gains and losses from the underlying transactions 
the company does not enter into forward exchange contracts or foreign currency options for trading purposes 
in addition  the company uses commodity contracts to hedge raw material costs expected to be denominated in foreign currency 
these contracts generally cover a one year period and all gains and losses are deferred and recognized in cost of goods sold with the underlying product costs 
as of june   the company did not have any material foreign currency options or forward exchange contracts outstanding 
as of june   the company s foreign currency options consisted of the option to exchange german marks at a fixed exchange rate of german marks per us dollar and british pound sterling at a fixed exchanged rate of per pound sterling

the notional principal amount under these foreign exchange contracts was approximately million and its related fair value was million at june  as of june   the notional amount of the commodity hedge contracts was million and the related fair market value of these contracts was million 
as of june   the notional amount of the commodity hedge contracts was million and the related fair market value of these contracts was million 
the unrealized gains or losses on these options or contracts represent hedges of foreign exchange gains and losses on a portion of the company s foreign earnings  cash flows and selected transactions 
as a result  the company does not expect future gains and losses on these contracts to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
