general net sales 
among the more significant factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s domestic and international markets  new product introductions  the level of advertising expenditures  the effectiveness of marketing and distribution programs and product pricing decisions 
reported sales are also affected by foreign exchange rates  primarily the us dollar swiss franc rate  because significant portions of the company s international sales are billed in swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
the company s business is very seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s north american markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays  and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center around significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring  however  because these markets are a less significant portion of the company s business  their impact is far less than that of the selling seasons in north america 
the company is continuing its efforts to expand sales in key international markets 
these efforts have included the recruitment of a number of key personnel with management level sales and marketing responsibilities  the addition and replacement of selected independent distributors  an increase in the number of sales representatives  retargeted and increased advertising and coordinated marketing programs designed to build brand awareness and consumer demand for the company s watches at point of sale 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors sales mix  product pricing strategy  component and labor costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
the company s gross margins on its manufactured brands are higher than those on its distributed brands and  therefore  any shift in overall sales mix toward the company s manufactured brands will generally have a favorable impact on margins 
in addition  margins on sales of a particular brand vary from model to model and  therefore  changes in the model sales mix within a brand will impact margins 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is  therefore  to some extent constrained by competitor actions 
the overall level of liquidation sales of discontinued models in a particular fiscal year can also impact the company s gross margins 
manufacturing costs of the company s movado and concord brands consist primarily of component costs  company and subcontractor assembly costs and unit overhead costs 
the company seeks to control and reduce component and subcontractor labor costs through a combination of negotiations with existing suppliers and alternative sourcing 
overall wage and salary costs at the company s manufacturing operations in switzerland are a function of production levels and local inflation 
these costs have remained fairly stable over the three previous fiscal years 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s production costs and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company  therefore  hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program has  in the recent past  been reasonably successful in stabilizing product costs despite exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of advertising  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual advertising expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various marketplaces around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of sales commissions  sales force travel costs and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary proportionally with overall sales levels 
retail operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and store rent 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  the cost of part time help to meet seasonal needs  and shipping costs and supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs and various other corporate expenses such as insurance  legal  internal audit and credit and collection costs 
operating expenses over the last three fiscal years reflect the effect of the implementation of the company s growth strategy 
the more significant expenses associated with this strategy included advertising and marketing expenses designed to increase market share for the corum  concord and movado brands  advertising and marketing costs for the continuing expansion of the company s esq line  additions to the company s sales force  salaries and rents associated with additional outlet stores  and the addition of staff to support distribution  inventory management and customer service requirements coincident with growth of the company s business 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   and net sales 
comparative net sales by product class were as follows in thousands concord  movado  coach and esq domestic    international    piaget and corum    other    net sales increased for the year ended january  the increase in net sales for fiscal was predominately due to growth in the company s established manufactured brands concord  movado and esq and expansion of the company s retail network  which consists of outlet stores and four movado boutiques and the piaget boutique partially offset by reductions in the company s distributed brands  due in part to the announced sale of the piaget brand in december see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company introduced the coach watch brand  its fourth manufactured brand  during the first quarter of fiscal which contributed significantly to sales growth 
domestic sales increases were predominantly due to the introduction of the coach watch line and growth in concord  movado and esq brand sales offset somewhat by reductions in sales of the piaget and corum brands 
growth in the international business was predominantly due to growth of movado in the far east  middle east and the caribbean 
net sales increased in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from growth in sales in the us and unit sales gains in the company s international business 
sales increases in the u 
s were primarily in the movado and concord brands 
these increases were partially offset by sales declines in the company s esq  piaget and corum brands 
esq sales declined in fiscal in comparison to fiscal principally because of the significant expansion of the brand s retail network  which occurred during fiscal piaget sales declines were due primarily to planned reductions in the distribution channels for the brand 
the increase in the company s international business was due predominantly to sales increases of the concord and movado brands in the middle east  far east and caribbean offset somewhat by the negative impact of a change in translation rates 
gross margins 
the gross margin for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the increase in margin was predominately due to a favorable sales mix  particularly an increase in the proportion of sales of concord  movado  coach and esq to our other brands 
the company s gross margin also benefited slightly from increases in the us dollar against the swiss franc 
the company s gross margin increased from to in fiscal  principally as a result of sales mix  particularly an increase in the proportion of concord  movado and esq sales to net sales 
the company s gross margin also benefited by increases in the us dollar against the swiss franc 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal were million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was largely the result of planned increases in both advertising and selling costs in the united states which were necessary to launch the coach brand and to develop and introduce new product line extensions within the movado brand through the movado boutiques 
in addition  increases in general and administrative costs were due to personnel increases which were necessary for the support of our movado boutiques as well as cost increases for information systems and employee benefit programs 
operating expenses increased in fiscal to of net sales from of net sales in fiscal the increase in fiscal operating expenses occurred primarily in the advertising  selling and general and administrative expense categories 
distribution costs declined as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in advertising and marketing expenditures in fiscal which occurred primarily in the us  was planned  and related to the company s ongoing efforts to build identity and image for its brands 
fiscal advertising and marketing costs were affected by higher levels of media spending for concord  movado and  in particular  esq in the u 
s and increased marketing and promotional activities in the us for all of the company s brands 
the growth in consolidated advertising costs included increased media spending in certain international markets  primarily the far east and middle east and certain european markets 
fiscal general and administrative expenses included increased employee benefit costs and rents due to the expansion of office space necessitated by the company s growth and head count increases 
interest expense 
net interest expense for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of interest on the company s senior notes  series a senior notes  revolving lines of credit under the july restated credit agreement  as amended  and borrowings against working capital lines 
income taxes 
the company s income tax provision amounted to million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively  or of pretax income for fiscal and and  for fiscal a portion of the company s consolidated operations are located in non us jurisdictions  and  therefore  the company s effective rate differs from us statutory rates 
the majority of the company s non us operations are located in jurisdictions with statutory rates below us rates 
the company believes that the future effective tax rate will range from to  however  there can be no assurance of this as it is dependent on a number of factors  including the mix of foreign to domestic earnings  local statutory tax rates and the company s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs have been  and are expected to remain  primarily a function of its seasonal working capital requirements  which have increased due to significant growth in domestic sales over the two previous years 
the company s business is not capital intensive and liquidity needs for capital investments have not been significant in relation to the company s overall financing requirements 
the company has met its liquidity needs primarily through funds from operations and bank borrowings with domestic and swiss banks 
the company s future requirements for capital will relate not only to working capital requirements for the expected continued growth of its existing brands  domestically and internationally  but also to funding new product lines 
in addition  the company made a million sinking fund payment on february  and is required to make another on january  in connection with its senior notes which were issued in the original principal amount of million 
the company s revolving credit and working capital lines with its domestic bank group provide for a three year million unsecured revolving line of credit  pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of july   among the company  the chase manhattan bank  as agent  fleet bank na  as co agent  and other banks signatory thereto  restated bank credit agreement  and million of uncommitted working capital lines of credit

as of january   the company had purchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
in march  the board approved a revised stock repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock up to an aggregate repurchase price of million  in addition to the shares previously purchased 
the company s debt to total capitalization ratio was at january   as compared to at january  the increase in the debt to total capitalization was due to the company borrowing million of series a senior notes 
the company s net working capital  consisting primarily of trade receivables and inventories  amounted to million and million at january  and january   respectively 
accounts receivable at january  were million as compared to million at january  the increase in receivables was primarily the result of growth in the company s business and the addition of the coach brand  which has been offset by piaget receivables classified as assets held for sale 
inventories at january  were million as compared to million at january  the increase in inventories from january  to january  reflected the expansion of the company s product line  in particular the introduction of the coach brand and the opening of the movado boutiques which has been offset by piaget inventory classified as assets held for sale 
the company s capital expenditures for the year ended january  were approximately million compared to million for the year ended january  expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to planned expenditures in the company s information systems  including retail information systems  expansion of the company s movado boutiques and further expansion of the company s network of outlet stores 
the company s capital expenditures for the year ended january  were approximately million compared to million for the year ended january  expenditures in fiscal were primarily related to improvements in the company s management and sales management information systems and costs incurred in connection with the expansion of domestic distribution operations

recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas in june sfas requires all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes new accounting practices for hedge instruments 
sfas is required for the fiscal years beginning after june  management of the company is currently analyzing the effect sfas will have on the company s statement of position and results of operations 
market risks the company s primary market risk exposure relates to foreign currency exchange risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s purchases are denominated in swiss francs 
the company reduces its exposure to the swiss franc exchange rate risk through a hedging program 
under the hedging program  the company purchases various financial instruments  predominantly forward and option contracts 
gains and losses on financial instruments resulting from this hedging activity are offset by the effects of the currency movements on respective underlying hedged transactions 
if the company did not engage in a hedging program  any change in the swiss franc to local currency would have an equal effect on the entities cost of sales 
as of january   the company s hedging portfolio consisted of various swiss franc forward contracts and swiss franc option contracts 
the forward contracts have various maturity dates through june  with an average forward rate of swiss franc per dollar 
the company has million of option contracts with a maturity date of may  the option contracts have an average strike price of 
as of january  the carrying value of the options amounted to approximately million  which represents the unamortized premium of the option and a fair market value of approximately million 
in addition  the company has certain debt obligations with variable interest rates  which are based on market interest 
the company does not hedge these interest rate risks 
the company also has certain debt obligations with fixed interest rates 
the difference between the market based interest rates at the balance sheet date and the fixed rates was minimal 
euro conversion on january   of the member countries of the european union established permanent  fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency called the euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is scheduled to phase in over a period ending january   with the existing currency being completely removed from circulation on july  the company has been preparing for the use of the euro 
the timing of the company s phasing out all uses of the existing currencies will comply with applicable legal requirements and also will be scheduled to facilitate optimal coordination with the plans of our vendors 
the company does not currently have significant transactions denominated in euro related currencies 
this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the company believes the introduction of the euro and the phasing out of the other currencies will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
year general many older computer software programs and other equipment with embedded chips or processors collectively systems refer to years in terms of their last two digits only 
such systems may incorrectly interpret the year to mean the year if not corrected  those systems could cause date related transaction failures 
project the company initiated a project in the project to improve and standardize data and computer technology 
the project is designed to replace all obsolete hardware and software with systems that are year compliant and in addition  to replace most business software systems 
the project calls for the replacement or upgrade of all pcs  servers  network components  desktop software  core business software which support manufacturing  distribution  sales  accounting  after sales service  retail point of sale  and electronic data interchange edi 
the new global technical network infrastructure hardware  software  and communication technology has been implemented in all us locations  switzerland and canada 
the remaining technical network infrastructure for the far east was implemented in february a new retail point of sale and merchandise system that is year compliant was implemented in fiscal for all store and headquarters locations 
as part of the project  new client server core business applications software bpcs which is designed to be year compliant supporting manufacturing  distribution  sales  accounting and after sales service was implemented in the us in march the company has been working with system software associates  inc ssa to complete such implementation and testing as well as implementation and testing of the same bpcs applications software at the company s canadian  far east and swiss facilities 
such implementation is expected to be completed in switzerland during the summer of and in canada and the far east by the end of the calendar year 
existing business applications software systems operating in canada and the far east  however  have been made year compliant in any event by the implementation of upgrades  which were completed in february minor program and procedural changes were previously implemented to support fiscal year processing for our existing swiss business systems 
the company has tested the bpcs applications software by reviewing the database and program definitions to confirm that the date formats are four digit year specific 
after completion of the quarter end processing related to the end of the first quarter of fiscal  the company plans to conduct further testing by simulating the date change to january  the company has developed a contingency plan with the goal of insuring that the company s swiss business systems are year compliant in the event implementation of the bpcs core business applications software is not completed before the end of calendar year this plan calls for the implementation of certain upgrades and the remediation of applications software that is not year compliant 
as a result of the project and its contingency planning  the company expects that it will be year compliant  on a global basis  by the end of calendar year by the use of questionnaires  the company is monitoring the year system status of customers and vendors involved with electronic interchange of data with our systems 
this monitoring will continue throughout non electronic data exchange contingency approaches including reliance on communications by fax will be used  if required  with those customers or vendors which fail to reach year system compliance by january  costs costs associated with systems replacement and modification to become year compliant under the contingency plan outside of the project are expected to be approximately  and will be funded through the company s working capital lines and other credit facilities 
the estimated total cost of the project is approximately million 
the total amount expended on the project through january  was approximately million which has been capitalized as a long term asset 
this estimate assumes that the company will not incur significant year related costs due to the failure of customers  vendors and other third parties to be year compliant 
risks the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s result of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the project as scheduled  and the company s contingency plan  if necessary  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
no major information technology projects have been deferred as a result of the project 
other on december   the company entered into an agreement with vlg north america  inc vlg for the sale to vlg of substantially all of the assets  properties and rights related to the piaget business 
the transaction was completed on february  at a sale price of approximately million 
the company will report a pretax gain  representing the excess of the sale price over the net book value of the assets sold at january   during the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  the company recorded million in assets held for sale at january
