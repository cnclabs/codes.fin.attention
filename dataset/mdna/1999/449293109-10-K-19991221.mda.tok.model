item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s net revenues through fiscal year increased due to a variety of factors  including acquisitions and  in many cases  increased sales volumes in both existing and acquired business lines 
during fiscal year  net revenues declined largely due to a decrease in demand for the company s oilfield services 
the company s revenue is classified within two operating segments petrochemical processing and oilfield services 
petrochemical processing revenues are derived from distributing plastic powders  grinding petrochemicals into powders size reduction  providing ancillary services and selling grinding equipment manufactured by the company  and compounding sales and services  which include the manufacture and sale of concentrates 
the company s distribution operations utilize the company s size reduction and compounding facilities to process petrochemical products prior to sale 
oilfield services revenues include revenues derived from exploration sales and services new tubular goods inspection  production sales and services reclamation  reconditioning and inspection of used tubular goods and sucker rods  corrosion control services coating of tubular goods and sucker rods  and other sales and services oilfield engine sales and services in canada 
service revenues in both of the company s business segments are recognized as the services are performed or  in the case of product sales  revenues are generally recognized upon shipment to third parties 
cost of sales and services for the petrochemical processing and oilfield services segments is primarily comprised of compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity and equipment costs and supplies  and  in the case of concentrate manufacturing operations and the company s distribution business  purchased raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  accounting  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
the gross margin percentages for the distribution and concentrate manufacturing businesses  generally are significantly lower than those generated by the company s size reduction services 
several of the company s petrochemical processing subsidiaries  including the company s concentrate manufacturing and distribution operations  typically buy raw materials  improve the material and then sell the finished product 
in contrast  many of the company s size reduction operations  particularly the us locations  typically involve processing customer owned material referred to as toll processing 
as a result of these factors  the expansion of the company s distribution and concentrate manufacturing businesses within the petrochemical processing segment has had the effect of reducing overall petrochemical processing margins as a percentage of revenue 
the demand for the company s oilfield products and services depends upon oil and natural gas prices and the level of oil and natural gas production and exploration activity 
in addition to changes in commodity prices  exploration and production activities are affected by worldwide economic conditions  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  seasonal trends and the political stability of oil producing countries 
the oil and gas industry has been highly volatile over the past several years  due primarily to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
during fiscal and  the oil and gas service industry generally experienced increased demand and improved product and service pricing as a result of improved commodity prices and greater levels of oil and gas exploration and production activity  due largely to a strong world economy 
in fiscal  however  oil prices declined significantly versus fiscal levels 
while gas prices also declined during this period  they declined to a lesser extent 
these trends were attributed to  among other factors  an excess worldwide oil supply  lower domestic energy demand resulting from an unseasonably warm winter and a decline in demand due to the economic downturn in southeast asia 
as oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices declined during this period  demand for oilfield products and services  including those provided by the company  softened 
oil and gas prices continued to fall sharply in the first half of fiscal  reaching a low of just under eleven dollars per barrel during the first quarter of fiscal this year low  in real dollar terms  resulted in extremely depressed levels of oilfield exploration and production activity 
the company s oilfield service revenues and income have been adversely impacted by these factors 
more recently  the price of oil has risen to above per barrel and natural gas prices have also risen 
this increase  however  has not yet resulted in any material increase in the demand for the company s products and services  particularly exploration related products and services 
although  barring another collapse of commodity prices  the company anticipates that oilfield service activity will increase and  hence  the demand for the company s oilfield services will improve  it appears that the level of activity will continue to be relatively weak  at least during the first quarter of fiscal although the company is optimistic that  if oil and gas prices remain at or near their present levels  market conditions will improve at some point  the timing of such a recovery cannot be predicted with certainty 
liquidity and capital resources the following are considered by management as key measures of liquidity applicable to the company cash and cash equivalent   working capital   current ratio debt to capitalization 
to 
to year ended september  compared to year ended september  cash and cash equivalents decreased  during fiscal year and the company s working capital decreased during fiscal year from  at september  to  at september   as a result of the factors described below 
during fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities increased to  compared to for the year ended september  net cash provided by operating activities improved despite the fact that the company incurred a net loss in fiscal  compared to net income in fiscal the increase was due to the fact that during fiscal  a gain on sale of the wedtech equity investment was included in net income  but was classified as an investing activity 
also  in fiscal the net loss included several non cash charges 
lastly  changes in the working capital accounts had a significant influence on the change in net cash provided by operating activities 
capital expenditures totaled  during fiscal  of which  related to the oilfield services segment and  related to the petrochemical processing segment 
a majority of fiscal capital expenditures were incurred to expand or enhance existing facilities  as opposed to replacement or refurbishment of existing productive or soon to be retired assets 
fiscal capital expenditure requirements are expected to be financed using existing cash and or funds available under foreign credit facilities 
cash flows used for financing activities declined to  during fiscal year compared to  during fiscal the decline was primarily due to increased borrowings and lower common stock dividends  partially offset by greater debt repayments and lower proceeds from the sale of common stock 
during fiscal years through  the company acquired sixteen businesses 
during fiscal  the company used  of cash to acquire one oilfield service business 
these sixteen acquisitions were made primarily using available cash  the issuance of the company s common stock and the assumption of outstanding debt of the acquired businesses 
the company anticipates it will continue to seek acquisitions in the future  however  it is expected that the number of acquisitions will decline in comparison to recent years 
this trend will have the effect of reducing both the company s revenue growth and its capital requirements 
as of november   the company had approximately  of additional borrowing capacity available under various foreign credit arrangements 
currently  the company does not have a domestic credit facility 
the company anticipates that existing cash balances and the additional borrowing capacity provided by the foreign credit facilities will be an adequate source of liquidity for fiscal the terms of the company s senior notes limit the amount of liens and additional indebtedness incurred by the company 
the company s foreign facilities are generally secured by assets owned by subsidiaries of the company and also carry various financial covenants

consolidated revenues decreased  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decline is attributable to an oilfield service revenue decline partially offset by a petrochemical processing revenue increase 
petrochemical processing revenues increased from  during fiscal to  for fiscal this increase of was due to the acquisitions of jr courtenay jr in march  and soreco in june and an increase of domestic compounding revenues  offset  in part  by lower domestic grinding revenues and lower overall european revenues 
distribution revenues were  for fiscal year  an increase of  for fiscal the increase primarily resulted from the effect of the courtenay acquisition during march  partially offset by a decline in european distribution revenues 
size reduction services and other sales and service revenues declined  during fiscal to  compared to fiscal the decline resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for the company s products and services domestically and in europe 
compounding sales and service revenues increased  to  for fiscal this increase is mostly due to greater domestic compounding revenues  due in large part to a mid fiscal domestic compounding capacity expansion and the acquisition of soreco made in june oilfield service revenues declined from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this result represents a decline of  
the revenue decline was broad based  across all oilfield service product lines and was the result of declining demand for the company s oilfield products and services 
management responded to the lower fiscal revenues with significant cost reductions  particularly personnel reductions as described below 
declining demand is the result of depressed average oil and  to a lesser extent  gas prices during much of fiscal  which has resulted in significantly lower average rig counts in both the united states and canada during fiscal  compared to fiscal the revenue decrease was partially offset by the effect of the milcorp acquisition in february during the year ended september   the domestic drilling rig count averaged  a decline from the average of approximately during fiscal west texas intermediate crude prices improved from an average price of during fiscal to during fiscal during most of fiscal  the price of oil rose and is currently above per barrel 
this increase  however  has not yet resulted in an increase in the level of drilling activity in north america to average fiscal levels 
in fact  the us drilling rig count declined to only rigs on april  and has been rising slowly to rigs as of december  this trend is detrimental to the company s oilfield service business  not only from a revenue perspective  but also because this trend has the effect of lowering overall margins  since the company s exploration services sales usually generate higher gross margins than other oilfield products and services sales 
fortunately  production activity improved in the second half of fiscal  as evidenced by a improvement of the company s production services revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  over the third quarter of fiscal barring another collapse of oil and gas prices  the company anticipates that oilfield service activity will generally continue to increase and  hence  the demand for the company s oilfield services will increase 
the timing and duration of a demand recovery  if any  however  cannot be predicted with certainty 
costs and expenses 
consolidated gross margins calculated as net revenues minus total costs of sales and services  as a percentage of revenues  decreased from during fiscal to during fiscal gross margins declined during the year due to a decrease in oilfield service gross margins  partially offset by an increase in petrochemical gross margins 
petrochemical gross margins were during fiscal compared to during fiscal the improvement was primarily the result of an increase in domestic and european gross margins  as a percentage of revenues 
domestic gross margin gains resulted from cost cutting efforts  production efficiency improvements and an increase in domestic compounding volumes due in large part to the mid year capacity expansion 
european improvements resulted from a favorable revenue mixture  along with the beneficial effect of rising resin prices during the last half of fiscal oilfield service gross margins declined to for fiscal from in fiscal the decline was driven by lower volumes as costs were spread over less revenues  weaker pricing  due to very poor market conditions and a less favorable revenue mix 
additionally  during the second quarter  the company wrote down  of oilfield service inventory to estimated market selling prices  thereby increasing cost of sales expenses 
the company reacted to poor market conditions by rationalizing the cost structure of the oilfield service business to reflect current activity levels 
these cost reductions included a significant headcount reduction of the oilfield service workforce during the past year and a reduction of contract labor expenses 
additionally  during fiscal  most oilfield service salaried and hourly employees accepted a pay reduction 
the company s chairman cfo and ceo president also voluntarily accepted a pay cut 
in august  of the pay reduction was reestablished and  in december  the remaining portion was reinstated 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased  during fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease resulted from significant cost reductions within the oilfield service and domestic petrochemical businesses and lower corporate management compensation expenses 
these declines were partially offset by an increase of selling  general and administrative expenses due to the acquisitions of jr courtenay  soreco and milcorp and an increase in workers compensation expenses 
the decline in oilfield service and domestic petrochemical processing selling  general and administrative expenses were driven largely by staffing reductions 
as a percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in the increase is mostly due to the drastic decline in oilfield service revenues  offset partially by the expense reductions discussed above 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was mostly the result of capital expenditures and business acquisitions during and impairment of long lived assets 
during fiscal  the company recognized a  non cash charge for the impairment of long lived assets 
of this charge relates to the oilfield services business  of which of the write down related to the impairment of goodwill and the remaining to machinery and equipment 
 of the total charge relates to the petrochemical business and reflects the impairment of four underperforming facilities 
 of the petrochemical charge includes the impairment of goodwill and  consists of machinery and equipment impairment 
the amount of the machinery and equipment impairments were determined by comparing fair values with the corresponding carrying values of the assets evaluated 
fair value was determined as the estimated current market value of the assets evaluated 
write off of property  plant and equipment 
during fiscal  the company reduced the carrying value of property  plant and equipment primarily due to assets which are obsolete or are not in working order and will not be used in the future 
of the  write down   related to the petrochemical business and related to the oilfield service segment 
severance expenses 
during fiscal  the company recognized severance expenses of  relating to terminated employees 
of this charge  related to management changes within the company s european petrochemical processing operations 
write off of start up costs 
the write off of start up costs of primarily relates to the closure  during the second quarter of fiscal  of an operation which had capitalized start up costs 
this operation had an immaterial impact on the company s financial results prior to the write off of capitalized start up costs 
operating income 
operating income decreased from  during fiscal to a loss of  during fiscal the decrease was due to the changes in revenues and costs and expenses discussed above 
gain on sale of equity investment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of  on the sale of an equity investment 
the company received cash of  and recorded an after tax gain of approximately  on the sale 
interest income expense 
net interest expense was  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal this change was primarily the result of lower cash balances due to acquisitions and internal capital expenditures 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate decreased to during fiscal compared to during fiscal the effective income tax rate decrease was caused by a change of the mixture of pre tax income generated in different tax jurisdictions  a significant increase of permanent differences between taxable and book income primarily due to fiscal write down of impaired goodwill and the fact that the company s fiscal sale of an equity investment generated tax expense equal to of the pre tax gain 
the company has  for tax purposes   in net operating loss carryforwards which expire between and  and in investment  alternative minimum and other tax credit carryforwards which  if utilized  will result in a cash savings 
net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of  and all of the tax credits are expected to expire unused 
extraordinary gain 
during fiscal the company repurchased senior notes with a face value of  at a discount  recognizing a pre tax gain of and an after tax gain of net income 
for fiscal  the company had a net loss after the extraordinary item of  compared to net income of  in fiscal  due to the factors described above 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the dutch guilder  swedish krona  british pound  italian lira  canadian dollar  the french franc  the australian dollar and the new zealand dollar did not materially impact the translation of revenues and income of the company s international operations 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues 
consolidated revenues increased  during fiscal compared to fiscal the revenue growth resulted primarily from the business acquisitions made by the company during fiscal and and  to a lesser extent  internal growth within both of the company s business segments 
oilfield service revenues increased  or to  during fiscal the revenue growth was driven primarily by the fiscal oilfield service acquisitions and the increased demand for the company s services during the first half of fiscal during the third quarter  the revenue growth rate declined  and revenues contracted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to fiscal exploration services revenues increased  or during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily a result of the effects of an acquisition 
the company s exploration services are driven  in large part  by the domestic rig count which declined significantly over the course of fiscal  however  the average fiscal domestic rig count was down only slightly versus the fiscal average 
exploration service revenues were consistent with the change of the average rig count  down less than  absent the effect of an acquisition 
production service revenues increased  during fiscal compared to  mostly due to an acquisition  rather than internal growth 
production service revenues are driven by the level of production activity  which in turn  is dependent upon oil and gas prices and the level of rig workover activity 
during fiscal  average oil and gas prices and the workover rig count were down compared to fiscal despite this fact  production service revenues increased modestly during fiscal  excluding the effect of the curley s acquisition 
corrosion control revenues improved  during compared to fiscal this revenue growth resulted from relatively strong gulf of mexico activity compared to other oil and gas production and exploration geographical areas 
other oilfield sales and services consist of the company s canadian oilfield engine sales and reconditioning business 
these revenues declined primarily as a result of declining oil prices during fiscal compared to fiscal petrochemical processing revenues increased  or during fiscal compared to fiscal of this growth  resulted from the fiscal and acquisitions  all of which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method of accounting  the results of each acquired entity are included in the company s consolidated results only from the date of the acquisition forward 
size reduction services and other sales and services revenues improved to  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal  representing an increase of  
in addition to the effect of the business acquisitions  these revenues increased due to internal growth in the company s domestic and european operations 
compounding sales and services revenues increased  or almost entirely due to the fiscal and acquisitions  particularly the acquisition of bayshore 
distribution revenues rose  or  primarily due to the acquisitions and the growth of the company s european distribution operations 
worldwide revenues of one petrochemical processing customer comprised approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
costs and expenses 
gross margins calculated as total revenues minus total costs of sales and services  as a percentage of revenues in fiscal declined to compared to in fiscal the declines resulted primarily from the revenue growth in the petrochemical business segment and  particularly in the distribution business  which  in the aggregate  generates lower gross margins as a percentage of revenues 
within the company s oilfield service business  gross margins as a percentage of revenues declined approximately to 
the decline resulted primarily from a change in the relative mixture of various product sales and service revenues rather than a significant change in average prices 
petrochemical processing gross margins declined from  of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal the decline is primarily due to the significant increases in lower margin compounding and distribution revenues as a percentage of total petrochemical processing revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal generally  gross margins as a percentage of revenues of the company s size reduction operations  performed on a toll basis  are higher than the gross margins of the oilfield service operations 
conversely  the gross margins of the company s concentrate and ground petrochemical powder manufacturing and distribution businesses are generally lower than oilfield service gross margins  as a percentage of revenues  due to the higher raw material cost component included in these revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from  during fiscal to  during fiscal the increase resulted from the timing of the fiscal and acquisitions  and an increase in corporate administration and oilfield service expenses 
corporate expenses rose primarily due to an increase in legal and bonus expenses 
a majority of fiscal legal expenses related to legal matters discussed in item legal proceedings included in this form k 
two of the legal matters  which comprised a significant portion of fiscal legal expenses  have been concluded favorably 
the bonus expense increase was due to bonuses of  paid by the company to over employees during the first quarter of fiscal and was classified as a general corporate expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company began to reduce oilfield service selling  general and administrative expenses based upon the reduced levels of activity in this business and has continued to reduce such expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal the change was primarily the result of the increases in expenses  described above  offset by the effect of increased distribution and compounding revenues 
generally  the company s distribution and compounding operations incur lower selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than the company s other sales and services 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase resulted from additions of property  plant and equipment and goodwill primarily due to the acquisitions made during fiscal and the timing of acquisitions  as well as increased amortization of debt issuance costs related to the june senior notes placement 
operating income 
operating income declined from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease was due to the changes in revenues and costs and expenses discussed above 
gain on sale of equity investment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of  on the sale of the company s equity ownership in wedtech inc the company received cash of  and recorded an after tax gain of  on the sale 
interest income expense 
net interest expense was  during fiscal for fiscal  the company incurred net interest expense of  this change was primarily the result of the june issuance of  senior notes and  to a lesser extent  debt assumed in connection with the fiscal and acquisitions 
income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to during fiscal  compared to during fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the sale of the company s equity investment in wedtech which created tax expense equal to of the pre tax gain  an increase in permanent book to tax differences relative to pre tax income  offset by the effect of a decline in the company s italian operations income tax rates 
as non deductible goodwill amortization continues to increase  due to future acquisitions  the company would anticipate that future effective tax rates  likewise  would increase 
additionally  the company s overall tax rate varies depending upon the mixture of pre tax income generated by the company s operations in various taxing jurisdictions 
net income 
for fiscal  the company had net income of  as compared to net income of  for fiscal  due to the factors described above 
foreign currency translation 
the fluctuations of the us dollar against the dutch guilder  swedish krona  british pound  italian lira  canadian dollar  and the french franc did not materially impact the translation of revenues and income of the company s foreign operations materially 
year issue the year problem arose because some computer programs use only the last two digits of a year as a reference date  causing the program to improperly recognize a year that does not begin with the company began working toward year readiness in fiscal and has now completed its year readiness project 
to improve access to business information through common  integrated computing systems within business operations  the company instituted a business systems replacement project for its domestic  australian and new zealand petrochemical operations 
the new systems business replacement systems  which the company believes have made these operations business computer systems year ready  have now been completed and implemented 
remaining business software programs  which are used by the company s oilfield and european petrochemical operations  were modified  in the case of oilfield operations  and upgraded  in the case of european petrochemical operations  to make them year ready 
the implementation of the year readiness project has not resulted in any other it projects being deferred  except for a delay in non year related upgrades of the oilfield operation s business software program 
the company has already begun making these upgrades 
overview 
the company s year readiness project was divided into four sections corporate and facility infrastructure  applications software  inspection and processing equipment  and third party suppliers 
each section consisted of four phases year readiness analysis and assessment  retiring  replacing  or upgrading items that were not year ready  remediation testing of upgraded and replacement hardware and software  and contingency planning 
application software 
application software consisted of all software not used directly in conjunction with the operation of the company s service and manufacturing facilities 
the application software section included the conversion of software which was not year ready or  where available from the supplier  the replacement of such software 
the company has completed the application software s analysis and assessment  conversion and replacement  and testing phases 
the company believes its application software is currently year ready 
corporate infrastructure 
the corporate infrastructure section consisted of mainframe computing hardware and connectivity 
the company has completed the corporate infrastructure s analysis and assessment  upgrade and replacement  and testing phases 
the company believes its corporate infrastructure is currently year ready 
facility infrastructure 
the facility infrastructure section consisted of hardware and systems software  including embedded computer chips  used in the operation of the company s facilities 
the facility infrastructure s analysis and assessment  replacement  upgrade and conversion  and testing phases have been completed 
the company believes its facility infrastructure is currently year ready 
inspection and processing equipment 
the company s oilfield services sector uses and manufactures inspection and processing equipment  which the company believes to currently be year ready 
the company s petrochemical sector uses and manufactures processing equipment  which the company believes to currently be year ready 
third party suppliers 
the company has identified  communicated with and evaluated the state of year preparedness of critical third party suppliers for all its operations 
as noted in more detail below  the company has developed a contingency plan in which it has identified alternative suppliers that can be used if necessary 
contingency planning 
the company has developed a contingency plan to minimize year risk 
the plan covers areas in which the year readiness project may not adequately address all of the relevant risk issues 
for example  the company cannot guarantee the year readiness of critical third party suppliers  and thus has taken steps to reduce the risk of an external partner related failure 
these steps include identifying alternative suppliers of raw materials and equipment  and alternative shippers of raw materials and finished products 
the company also will staff a communications center that will monitor year developments  notify business operations of year related problems  and assist operations in remedying these problems 
costs 
the total cost associated with required software and hardware modifications to become year ready has not been material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the estimated total cost of the year readiness project was approximately the total amount expended on the project through september  was about the cost to implement the business replacement systems is not included in these estimates 
costs related to the year project have been accounted for in accordance with the company s existing policies 
other than purchases of new hardware and software  year project expenditures have been expensed as incurred 
risks 
a year failure could result in a business disruption that adversely affects the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  if a year failure causes insufficient rail and freight service to be available to the company  the receipt of raw materials and the shipment of finished products by the company s petrochemical operations could be curtailed 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company cannot determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and the completion of the year project  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
conversion to the euro currency the company has a substantial portion of its operations within countries that adopted the euro currency on january  the company has begun invoicing and receiving payments denominated in euros whenever possible 
the cost of achieving this has not been material 
the adoption of the euro by the european economic and monetary union is ultimately expected  from a competitive viewpoint  to benefit the company to some extent as price transparency becomes a reality 
the benefit will  however  be somewhat limited as transportation costs are an important consideration for the company s customers 
at this time  the company anticipates that the impact of the adopting of the euro with regard to currency exchange and taxation implications will not have a material impact on the results of operations or the financial condition of the company

the significant indebtedness incurred in june as a result of the placement of the senior notes due has several important implications for the company  including  but not limited to  the following i a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to service the company s indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be restricted  iii the company s flexibility to expand  make capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be impaired future acquisitions may require the company to alter its capitalization significantly  which changes may significantly alter the leverage of the company  iv the indenture relating to the senior notes contains  and future agreements relating to the company s indebtedness may contain  numerous financial and other restrictive covenants  including  among other things  limitations on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens and other encumbrances  to make certain payments and investments  to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or to merge or consolidate with another entity failure to comply with these provisions may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company  and v the ability of the company to satisfy its obligations pursuant to such indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and management  financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the business and operations of the company  some of which are not in the company s control 
to the extent that the company is unable to repay the principal amount of the notes out of cash on hand  it may i seek to repay the notes with the proceeds of an equity offering  ii seek refinancing  or iii sell significant assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the forgoing alternatives will be available to the company at all or on terms that are favorable to the company 
if the company cannot satisfy its obligations related to such indebtedness  substantially all of the company s long term debt could be in default and could be declared immediately due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the oil and gas industry in which the company participates through its oilfield services business has experienced significant volatility 
demand for the company s oilfield services depends principally upon the level of domestic oil and gas drilling and workover activity  which  in turn  depends upon factors such as the level of oil and gas prices  expectations about future oil and gas prices  the cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas  worldwide weather conditions  international political  military  regulatory and economic conditions and the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital 
oil prices and  to a lesser extent  gas prices declined significantly during  which resulted in decreases in oil and gas exploration and production activities 
while oil and gas prices have rebounded during  oil and gas exploration and production activity remains depressed compared to fiscal levels 
no assurance can be given that current weak levels of domestic oil and gas exploration activities will improve or that the demand for the company s oilfield services will increase 
industry conditions will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the company will have no control 
a decline in oil or gas prices or domestic oilfield activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s oilfield service business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  the oilfield services business is substantially seasonal  reflecting the pattern of oilfield drilling and workovers  with the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal years having generally higher levels of activity 
drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time  particularly in the united states and canada 
the business cycles of the company s petrochemical processing services segment are affected by changes in the cost of the petrochemicals produced by the major chemical companies 
these costs are outside of the company s control and the business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  such business cycles may reflect cycles in the petroleum industry and oil and gas price changes  which also affect both of the company s business segments and may make the company  as a whole  vulnerable to the effect of changes in the petroleum industry 
the operations of the company s oilfield services and specialty petrochemical processing businesses are dependent to a certain degree upon proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets either developed by the company or licensed to it by third parties 
in many cases  these or equivalent processes or technologies are available to the company s competitors  customers and others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such persons will not develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary processes and technologies 
the availability to  or development by others of equivalent or superior information  processes or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has made many acquisitions  and management expects to acquire other businesses in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates and their owners  or that the company will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company at all  or without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
there can be no assurance that businesses acquired will achieve sales and profitability that justify the investment made by the company 
any inability on the part of the company to control these risks effectively and integrate and manage acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may  to the extent allowed by agreements  incur indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company entered the specialty petrochemical processing industry with its acquisition of wedco in april  and had no experience in the industry prior to the acquisition 
since the acquisition of wedco  the company has expanded its specialty petrochemical processing operations by making numerous business acquisitions 
the success of the company will depend  in part  on the company s ability to continue the integration of acquired specialty chemical operations by  among other things  centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and developing programs and processes that will promote cooperation among the businesses and the sharing of resources 
in addition  the recent growth of the company will place significant demands on the company s management  internal systems and networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage or implement its plans for these operations or that  if implemented  such plans will be successful 
in addition  in fiscal year  the company began to expand the distribution aspects of its specialty petrochemical production services business through the acquisition of the micropowders business  the execution of supply agreements with certain resin suppliers and the acquisitions of rotec  verplast  and jrc 
each of these operations  as well as the bayshore operation  requires the company to buy and manage inventories of supplies and products in the specialty petrochemical processing business 
the company s entry into the distribution portion of this business requires the company to maintain greater levels of working capital than it has historically and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values 
the maintenance of excessive inventories in these businesses could expose the company to losses from drops in market prices for its products while maintenance of insufficient inventories may result in lost sales to the company 
a portion of the company s current operations are conducted in international markets  particularly the company s western european and southeast asian specialty petrochemical processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations primarily through internal growth and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including  among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt markets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include equipment or product failures or work related accidents which could also result in personal injury  property damages  pollution and other environmental risks 
the company may not be fully insured against possible losses pursuant to such risks 
such losses could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition  from time to time  the company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its business and is currently involved in numerous legal proceedings in connection with its operations and those of its acquired companies 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur substantial liability as a result of these or other proceedings 
the company is subject to numerous and changing local  state  federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning the use  storage  treatment  disposal and general handling of hazardous materials  some of which may be considered to be hazardous wastes  and restricting releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain and maintain certain permits and other authorizations mandating procedures under which the company will operate and restricting emissions 
many of these laws and regulations provide for strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up contamination resulting from releases of regulated materials into the environment 
violations of mandatory procedures under operating permits may result in fines  remedial actions or  in more serious instances  shutdowns or revocation of permits or authorizations 
there can be no assurance that a review of the company s past  present or future operations by courts or federal  state  local or foreign regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the revocation of any of the company s material operating permits  the denial of any material permit application or the failure to renew any material interim permit could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company cannot predict what environmental laws and regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future law or regulation will be administered or interpreted 
to date  the company has incurred compliance and clean up costs in connection with environmental laws and regulations and there can be no assurance as to future costs 
in particular  compliance with more stringent environmental laws and regulations  more vigorous enforcement policies  or stricter interpretations of current laws and regulations  or the occurrence of an industrial accident  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
each of the industries in which the company participates is highly competitive 
some competitors or potential competitors of the company have substantially greater financial or other resources than the company 
the inability of the company to effectively compete in its markets would have a material adverse effect on the company
