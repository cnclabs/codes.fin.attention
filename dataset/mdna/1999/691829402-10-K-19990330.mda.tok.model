ibc was merged into the company 
oxis international sa operates as a subsidiary of the company 
in july  the company acquired therox pharmaceuticals  inc therox through an exchange of stock 
therox was merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition of therox provided the company with a technology portfolio complementary to its novel therapeutics for treatment of free radical associated diseases together with university relationships and seven patents 
on december   the company acquired innovative medical systems corp 
ims 
the name of ims was changed to oxis instruments  inc during oxis instruments  inc  develops  manufactures  markets and sells medical instruments 
the acquisitions of all four companies described above were completed through the exchange of stock and were accounted for as purchases  accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the dates of the acquisitions 
because the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases  the company s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the acquired businesses from the dates of acquisition only 
therefore  the results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from september   the results of therox s operations have been included in the consolidated statements of operations from july   and the results of ims operations are included in the company s consolidated statement of operations beginning january  costs relating to the acquisitions and the company s more complex corporate structure and the increased research and development investments have placed significant demand on the company s limited financial resources 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources below 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital increased during from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase in working capital resulted primarily from the proceeds from issuance of common stock of  offset by the effect of the net loss for  less non cash charges of 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december  however  the company expects to continue to report losses in as the level of expenses is expected to continue to exceed revenues 
the company can give no assurances as to when and if its revenues will exceed its expenses 
the company expects that new revenue sources or additional capital will be required during to continue operating in accordance with its current plans 
failure to either generate new revenue sources or to raise such additional capital would cause the company to severely curtail or cease operations 
see the information under the heading risk factors in item for a further discussion of these matters 
for more information concerning the company s ability to continue as a going concern  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes that its new products and technologies show considerable promise  its ability to realize significant revenues therefrom is dependent upon the company s success in developing business alliances with biotechnology and or pharmaceutical companies that have the required resources to develop and market certain of these products 
there is no assurance that the company s effort to develop such business alliances will be successful 
information systems and the year as is the case with most other companies using computers in their operations  the company is in the process of addressing the year problem 
the company is currently engaged in a project to review computer hardware and software to determine whether they will consistently and properly recognize the year certain of the company s systems include hardware and packaged software recently purchased from vendors who have represented that these systems are already year compliant 
other hardware and software currently being used by the company has been identified by the company as not being year compliant  particularly certain packaged software used in the company s accounting systems 
the company understands that upgrades to the software packages being used in its accounting and manufacturing systems are available from the vendors of those packages 
most of the hardware and software replacements for accounting and manufacturing systems expected to be required are replacements that would have been made regardless of the year issue 
if the company were unable to replace software and hardware to make its accounting and manufacturing systems year compliant  the company believes that it could implement manual systems to carry out its business without significant interruption 
the company expects to complete its review of all of its systems  including embedded technology in non information technology systems  which might be affected by the year issue by the second quarter of the company is reviewing communications  security  and environmental monitoring and control systems as well as certain laboratory and manufacturing equipment and equipment manufactured for customers 
the company believes that  in the worst likely case  such systems or components thereof can be replaced to make such systems year compliant 
the company expects that the total cost for upgrades and replacements of software  older computer hardware and other systems or components including embedded technology that might be affected by the year issue will not exceed  the company relies on a number of vendors and suppliers including banks  telecommunications providers  transportation companies and other providers of goods and services 
the inability of certain of these third parties to conduct their business for a significant period of time due to the year issue could have a material impact on the company s operations 
the company does not have the resources to determine whether all such vendors and suppliers are year compliant 
however  the company expects that it could find other vendors and suppliers if any of its current vendors or suppliers are unable to continue to provide goods or services to the company  but no assurances can be given as to how long it will take to find substitute vendors and suppliers 
results of operations revenues the company s sales for the past three years consisted of the following medical instruments  diagnostic and research assays    bovine superoxide dismutase bsod for research and human use    palosein r bsod for veterinary use    other    total sales    sales of medical instruments by the company began in  following the acquisition of ims on december  diagnostic and research assay sales volumes decreased in  resulting in a decrease in sales  following a increase in the decrease in bulk bsod sales in as compared to was due primarily to the decline in the value of the dutch guilder the currency in which the sales have been made as compared to the us dollar 
in no significant sales of bulk bsod were made 
the company has received an order from its spanish licensee for a delivery of bulk bsod in however  future sales of bulk bsod beyond are largely dependent on the needs of the company s spanish licensee which are uncertain and difficult to predict and no assurances can be given that the company will continue to sell bulk bsod to its spanish licensee 
sales of palosein r  which is sold primarily to veterinary wholesalers in the united states and europe increased by  to  in as a result of an increase in volume  particularly in export sales 
palosein r sales declined to  in the decrease in sales resulted from declining sales volumes due to a reduction in the company s marketing efforts 
costs and expenses cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased to in from in cost of sales increased further in  to of product sales 
the increase in was primarily caused by a decline in the gross margin on bulk bsod sales 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was due primarily to low product margins on sales of medical instruments in the company s cost of sales includes amortization of purchase price adjustments primarily technology acquired in and amortization of  in   in and  in 
excluding amortization of purchase adjustments the company s cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was in  in and in the company has taken steps to reduce the fixed costs of its medical instruments manufacturing operation in early by selling the facility and leasing back a portion of the space 
however  the company believes that for current production volumes it would be difficult to further reduce manufacturing costs 
therefore  significant improvements in product margins for both medical instruments and diagnostic and research assays are dependent on increases in sales volumes 
research and development costs decreased by  in to  from  this reduction in expenses was due primarily to reductions in expenses of the company s french subsidiary 
research and development costs increased by  to  in decreases in due to cost reductions of the company s french subsidiary  and a decrease in expenses relating to clinical studies of the company s lead therapeutic program  were offset by a  charge to write down the carrying value of equipment in the french subsidiary s research facility following the company s decision to close that facility 
the company has decided to further reduce its research and development by closing its french research laboratory 
in february the company notified approximately half of the french subsidiary s employees that their positions were being terminated due to the necessity to reduce costs 
substantially all research and development activities being carried on by the company s french subsidiary were ceased in early the company does not expect to renew the lease of the french subsidiary s facility when it terminates at the end of april savings in personnel costs from staff reductions in france in will be offset by termination costs pursuant to the employees government sponsored collective bargaining agreement 
the company estimates that such costs on the average will approximate six months salaries and benefits from the date of notice for french employees who are terminated to reduce costs 
in  sales  general and administrative expenses decreased by  from  in  to  in most of the decreases resulted from a reduction in the selling  general and administrative expenses of the company s french subsidiary 
in the third quarter of all of the company s manufacturing operations were consolidated in the united states and the french subsidiary became a research facility 
in connection with this restructuring  two administrative positions were eliminated and certain other costs which were previously charged to administrative expenses have subsequently been classified as research and development costs 
the administrative costs of the company s french subsidiary decreased  in as compared to sales  general and administrative expenses increased by  in  to  primarily due to the sales  general and administrative expenses of oxis instruments  inc  acquired by the company on december  net loss the company incurred net losses in  and  and does not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future 
decreases in research and development and sales  general and administrative expenses resulted in the decrease in the net loss for lower profit margins and increased sales  general and administrative expenses resulted in an increase in the net loss in the decreases in net loss per share in and are primarily due to the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding 
the company expects to incur a substantial net loss for if the company develops substantial new revenue sources or if substantial additional capital is raised through further sales of securities see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources  the company plans to continue to invest in research and development activities and incur sales  general and administrative expenses in amounts greater than its anticipated near term product margins 
if the company is unable to raise sufficient additional capital or to develop new revenue sources  it will have to cease  or severely curtail  its operations 
in this event  while expenses will be reduced  expense levels  and the potential write down of various assets  would still be in amounts greater than anticipated revenues
