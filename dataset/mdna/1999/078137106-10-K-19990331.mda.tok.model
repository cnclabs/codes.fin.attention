the company s effective income tax rate remained unchanged at in liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company has funded its working capital requirements principally through borrowings under bank lines of credit 
working capital requirements have included the financing of increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from sales growth 
on november  the company entered into a third amended and restated syndicated credit agreement arranged by california bank trust  as agent  formerly sumitomo bank of california 
the amendment increased the company s million revolving line of credit to million and extended the maturity date to may  at the company s option  the borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at california bank trust s prime rate or the adjusted libor rate plus 
at december   the prime interest rate was 
the balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit at december  was million 
obligations of the company under the revolving line of credit are secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the revolving line of credit requires the company to meet certain financial tests and to comply with certain other covenants on a quarterly basis  including restrictions on incurrence of debt and liens  restrictions on mergers  acquisitions  asset dispositions  declaration of dividends  repurchases of stock  making investments and profitability 
the company was in compliance with its bank covenants at december   however  there can be no assurance that the company will be in compliance with its bank covenants in the future 
if the company does not remain in compliance with the covenants in its amended and restated syndicated credit agreement and is unable to obtain a waiver of noncompliance from its banks  the company s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the company intends to utilize its revolving line of credit to fund future working capital requirements 
the company evaluates potential acquisitions from time to time and may utilize its line of credit to acquire complementary businesses  provided consent from its banks is obtained 
on november   the company acquired the computer products division of almo corporation for a total consideration of approximately million 
on november   the company acquired tenex data  a division of axidata  inc for a total consideration of approximately million

the company s accounts receivable and inventories as of december  increased to million and million at december  respectively  from million and million  respectively  as of december  days sales outstanding were at days and inventory turns were times per year 
these increases were primarily the result of the company s increased sales volume and the purchase of accounts receivable and inventory through the company s two acquisitions in november the company s accounts payable increased to million in from million in due to increased inventory purchases and the addition of accounts payable through the company s two acquisitions in november the net amount of cash provided by financing activities in was million  principally from utilization of the company s revolving line of credit with its banks

year compliance the year issue relates to the way computer systems and programs define calendar dates  they could fail or make miscalculations due to interpreting a date including to mean  not this could result in system failures causing disruptions in operations  including among other things  interruptions in processing business transactions and other normal business operations 
also  many systems and equipment that are not typically thought of as computer related referred to as non it contain embedded hardware or software that may have a time element 
the company s plan to address the year issue includes three phases identification of all systems and equipment  both information technology it and non it that may be affected by the year issue  evaluation and development of strategies to address affected systems and equipment  and remediation of affected systems and equipment 
the company has completed the first two phases in that it has identified all affected systems and equipment  both it and non it  and has completed its year compliance evaluation 
the company has determined that the majority of its affected systems both software and hardware require upgrade versus replacement in order to become year compliant 
as of december   the company has incurred expenses totaling approximately  estimated costs to complete the implementation including installation upgrade  testing and training is approximately  the company has an objective for its systems and equipment to be year compliant in the second quarter of the company has extended its estimated completion of remediation from the first quarter of to the second quarter of due to the acquisitions of almo cpd and tenex data in november the company has identified and contacted its critical suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company intends to change suppliers  service providers and contractors to those who have demonstrated year readiness but cannot be assured that it will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors 
the company does not currently have any formal information concerning the year compliance status of its customers but has received indications that most of its customers are working on year compliance 
in the event that any of the company s significant customers and suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them with new customers or alternate suppliers  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
in the event year issues relating to key customers and suppliers are not successfully resolved  based on information available to us at present  we believe that the most likely worst case scenario is a temporary disruption in infrastructure service  particularly power and telecommunications  which could adversely impact supplier deliveries or customer shipments 
if severe disruptions occur in these areas and are not corrected in a timely manner  a revenue or profit shortfall may result in the year the company has no contingency plan regarding the most reasonably likely case scenario in the event it does not adequately address the year issue 
the company s plans to develop a contingency plan before april  have been delayed until the third quarter of due to the two acquisitions in november item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s line of credit has an interest rate that is based on associated rates such as libor and the prime rate that may fluctuate over time based on changes in the economic environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  and could be subjected to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
an effective increase or decrease of in such interest rate percentages would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analysis performed by the company as of december  substantially all of the company s revenue and capital expenditure are transacted in us dollars 
transactions in other currencies and the associated risks of depreciation of value and volatility of cashflows have not been material to date 
the company is likely to be subject to increased foreign currency transactions and associated risks following the acquisition of toronto based tenex data in november to the extent the company is unable to manage these risks  the company s results and financial position could be materially adversely affected
