item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulation we are subject to regulation as a telecommunications service provider in some jurisdictions 
in addition  we or a local partner is required to have licenses or approvals in those countries where we operate and where equipment is installed 
united states federal regulation pursuant to the communications act of  as amended the communications act  the federal communications commission fcc is required to regulate the telecommunications industry in the u 
s 
under current fcc policy  telecommunications carriers reselling the services of other carriers  and not owning domestic telecommunications transmission facilities of their own  are considered non dominant and  as a result  are subject to streamlined regulation 
the degree of regulation varies between domestic telecommunications services services which originate and terminate within the u 
s 
and international telecommunications services services which originate in the u 
s 
and terminate in a foreign country or vice versa 
non dominant providers of domestic services do not require prior authorization from the fcc to provide service 
however  non dominant providers of international services must obtain authorization to provide service from the fcc pursuant to section of the communications act 
carriers providing international service also must file a tariff with the fcc  setting forth the terms and conditions under which they provide international services 
the fcc has determined that it no longer will require non dominant providers of domestic services to file tariffs  but instead will require carriers to post this information on the internet 
that decision has been stayed  pending appeal by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
we provide both domestic and international services to and from the us and therefore must possess authority under section of the communications act and must file tariffs for domestic and international services with the fcc 
we have held an authorization to provide service since we also have tariffs on file with the fcc setting forth the terms and conditions under which we provide domestic and international services 
in addition to these authorization and tariff requirements  the fcc imposes a number of additional requirements on all telecommunications carriers 
the regulatory requirements in force today impose a relatively minimal burden on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the current regulatory environment and the present level of fcc regulation will continue  or that we will continue to be considered non dominant 
non us government regulation telecommunications activities are subject to government regulation to varying degrees in every country throughout the world 
in many countries where we operate  equipment cannot be connected to the telephone network without regulatory approval  and therefore installation and operation of our operating platform or other equipment requires such approval 
we have licenses or other equipment approvals in the jurisdictions where we operate 
in most jurisdictions where we conduct business  we rely on our local partner to obtain the requisite authority 
in many countries our local partner is a national telephone company  and in some jurisdictions also is or is controlled by the regulatory authority itself 
as a result of relying on our local partners  we are dependent upon the cooperation of the telephone utilities with which we have made arrangements for our authority to conduct business  as well as for operational and certain of our administrative requirements 
our arrangements with these utilities are nonexclusive and take various forms 
although some of these arrangements are embodied in formal contracts  any telephone utility could cease to accommodate our requirements at any time 
depending upon the location of the telephone utility  such action could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
in some cases  principally countries which are members of the european community and the u 
s  laws and regulations provide that the arrangements necessary for us to conduct our service may not be arbitrarily terminated 
however  the time and cost of enforcing our rights may make legal remedies impractical 
we presently have good relations with most of the foreign utilities with which we do business 
there can be no assurance  however  that such relationships will continue or that governmental authorities will not seek to regulate aspects of our services or require us to obtain a license to conduct our business 
many aspects of our international operations and business expansion plans are subject to foreign government regulations  including currency regulations 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business opportunities 
see risk factors risks associated with international business 
ip telephony the regulation of ip telephony is still evolving 
the u 
s 
fcc has stated that some forms of ip telephony appear to be similar to traditional telephone service  but the fcc has not decided whether  or how  to regulate providers of ip telephony 
in addition  several efforts have been made to enact us federal legislation that would either regulate or exempt from regulation services provided over the internet 
state public utility commissions also may retain intrastate jurisdiction and could initiate proceedings to regulate the intrastate aspects of ip telephony 
a number of countries currently prohibit ip telephony 
other countries permit but regulate ip telephony 
if and to the extent that governments prohibit or regulate ip telephony  we could be subject to regulation and possibly to a variety of penalties under foreign or us law  including without limitation  orders to cease operations or to limit future operations  loss of licenses or of license opportunities  fines  seizure of equipment and  in certain foreign jurisdictions  criminal prosecution 
employees as of december   we employed two hundred two employees  as follows one hundred eleven in denver  colorado  seven in tarrytown  new york  four in washington  dc  twenty seven in reston  virginia  one in nyon  switzerland  nine in silkeborg  denmark  fourteen in hong kong  twenty nine in taipei  taiwan  one in brussels  belgium  seven in godalming  united kingdom and one in limassol  cyprus

certain recent developments effective with the period ended december   the company changed to a december  fiscal year end 
therefore  the period ended december  represents a nine month period as compared to the twelve month fiscal years ended march    and idx acquisition 
on december   we acquired idx international  inc idx  a privately held virginia corporation the idx acquisition 
idx is a supplier of ip internet protocol fax and ip voice platforms and services to telecommunications operators and isp s in countries 
with employees  idx currently has approximately million of annualized revenue based upon revenues for the most recent two month period ended december  
idx will provide us with two key services for our new suite of internet services ip fax and ip voice 
for at least the first year  idx will operate as a separate subsidiary  although we have begun to use its services to support some of the card services requirements 
idx will operate with its existing management and personnel in facilities in reston  virginia 
under the merger agreement signed with idx  we recently elected hsin yen  the president of idx  and richard chiang  the chairman of idx prior to the idx acquisition  to our board of directors 
this expands our board to a total of directors 
as the president of idx  hsin yen reports directly to mr 
vizas  our chairman and chief executive officer 
as a result of the idx acquisition  all of the shares of common stock and preferred stock of idx  outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the idx acquisition excluding any treasury shares were converted into  in the aggregate  a  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock series b preferred stock  which are convertible into up to  shares  shares until stockholder approval is obtained of our common stock common stock  subject to adjustment as described below  b warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to stockholder approval as well as adjustment as described below the idx warrants  and c million which amount is subject to decrease as described below  in interest bearing convertible subordinated promissory notes 
the shares of series b preferred stock are convertible at the holders option at any time at the then current conversion rate 
the shares of series b preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of our common stock on the earlier to occur of a the first date that the day average closing sales price of our common stock is equal to or greater than or b days after the later to occur of i december  or ii the receipt of any necessary stockholder approval relating to the issuance of the common stock upon such conversion  subject to idx s achievement of certain revenue and ebitda objectives 
the idx warrants are exercisable only to the extent that idx achieves certain revenue and ebitda goals over the twelve months ending december  and if stockholder approval is received 
we have guaranteed a price of per share at december  to recipients of the common stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise  as the case may be  of the series b preferred stock and idx warrants  subject to idx s achievement of certain revenue and ebitda objectives 
if the market price is less than on december   subject to idx s achievement of certain revenue and ebitda objectives  we will issue additional shares of common stock upon conversion of the series b preferred stock and exercise of the idx warrants subject to the receipt of any necessary stockholder approval based on the ratio of to the market price  but not more than an aggregate of million additional shares of common stock 
the convertible subordinated promissory notes are due in three installments the first of which was paid in stock in march through october   and are payable in cash or common stock valued at the then market price 
in addition  we have agreed to pay the accrued but unpaid dividends the idx accrued dividends on idx s preferred stock under an interest bearing convertible subordinated promissory note in the original principal amount of  due may  we are entitled to reduce the aggregate principal balance of the last payment due on the convertible subordinated promissory notes by the amount of the idx accrued dividends and certain other deferred amounts unless offset by net proceeds from the sale of a subsidiary of idx and a note issued to idx by an option holder

uci acquisition 
on december   we acquired uci tele networks  ltd 
uci  a privately held corporation established under the laws of the republic of cyprus the uci acquisition 
uci is a development stage calling card business serving greece  cyprus and the middle east 
we have projected that the uci acquisition will provide projected revenues in ranging between and million

exchange with ronald jensen 
in november  we reached an agreement with mr 
ronald jensen  who is also our largest stockholder 
the agreement concerned settlement of unreimbursed costs and potential claims 
mr 
jensen had purchased million of our common stock in a private placement in june and later was elected chairman of our board of directors 
after approximately three months  mr 
jensen resigned his position  citing both other business demands and the challenges of managing our business 
during his tenure as chairman  mr 
jensen incurred staff and other costs that were not billed to eglobe 
also  mr 
jensen subsequently communicated with our current management  indicating there were a number of issues raised during his involvement with eglobe relating to the provisions of his share purchase agreement which could result in claims against us 
to resolve all current and potential issues  mr 
jensen agreed with us to exchange his current holding of  shares of common stock for shares of our series c cumulative convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock  which management estimated to have a fair market value of approximately million and a face value of million 
the terms of the series c preferred stock permit mr 
jensen to convert the series c preferred stock into the number of shares equal to the face value of the preferred stock divided by of common stock market price  but with a minimum conversion price of per share and a maximum of per share  subject to adjustment if we issue common stock for less than the conversion price 
the difference between the estimated fair value of the series c preferred stock to be issued and the market value of the common stock surrendered resulted in a one time non cash charge to our statement of operations of million in the quarter ended september  with a corresponding credit to stockholders equity 
in connection with subsequent issuances of securities which are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock  we discussed with mr 
jensen the extent to which the conversion price of the series c preferred stock should be adjusted downward 
the parties agreed to exchange all of the outstanding series c preferred stock for shares of common stock  which exchange would have the same economic effect as if the series c preferred stock had been converted into common stock with an effective conversion price of per share 
on february   we agreed to exchange shares of series c preferred stock then held by mr 
jensen for  shares of common stock 
the market value of the  incremental shares of common stock issued of approximately million will be recorded as a preferred stock dividend in the quarter ended march  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
series d preferred stock 
we concluded a private placement of million in january with vintage products ltd 
vintage 
we sold i shares of our series d cumulative convertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock  ii warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of 
per share  and iii warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of per share  to vintage 
in addition  we agreed to issue to vintage  for no additional consideration  additional warrants to purchase the number of shares of common stock equal to  based on the market price of the common stock on the last trading day prior to june  or july   as the case may be  or pay  in cash  if we do not i consummate a specified merger transaction by may   or ii achieve  in the fiscal quarter commencing july   an aggregate amount of gross revenues equal to or in excess of of the aggregate amount of gross revenues achieved by the company in the fiscal quarter ended december  the shares of series d preferred stock are convertible  at the holder s option  into shares of our common stock at any time after april  at a conversion price  which is subject to adjustment if we issue common stock for less than the conversion price  equal to the lesser of or  if we fail to have positive ebitda for at least one of the first three fiscal quarters of or we fail to complete a public offering of equity securities for a price of at least per share and with gross proceeds to us of at least million on or before the end of the third fiscal quarter of  the market price just prior to conversion 
the shares of series d preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock upon the earliest of i the first date on which the market price of the common stock is or more per share for any consecutive trading days  ii the date on which or more of the series d preferred stock we issued has been converted into common stock  or iii the date we close a public offering of equity securities at a price of at least per share and with gross proceeds to us of at least million 
the shares of series d preferred stock must be redeemed if it ceases to be convertible which would happen if the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series d preferred stock exceeded of the number of shares of common stock outstanding when the series d preferred was issued  less shares reserved for issuance under warrants 
redemption is in cash at a price equal to the liquidation preference of the series d preferred stock at the holder s option or our option days after the series d preferred stock ceases to be convertible 
if we receive stockholder approval to increase the number of shares issuable we must issue the full amount of common stock upon conversion of the series d preferred stock even if the number of shares exceeds the maximum number 
vintage has agreed to purchase additional shares of series d preferred stock plus warrants for million upon the registration of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the series d preferred stock 
at that time we will issue to vintage warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of 
per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
series e preferred stock 
in february  contemporaneously with the exchange of mr 
jensen s series c preferred stock for shares of common stock  we concluded a private placement of million with extl investors llc  a limited liability company in which ronald jensen and his wife are the sole members extl investors 
we sold shares of our series e cumulative convertible redeemable preferred stock the series e preferred stock  and warrants the series e warrants to purchase i  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share and ii  shares of common stock with an exercise price of 
per share to extl investors 
the shares of the series e preferred stock may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the face value plus accrued dividends  in cash or in common stock  at our option or at the option of any holder  provided that the holder has not previously exercised the convertibility option described  at any time following the date that is five years after we issue the series e preferred stock 
the series e preferred stockholder may elect to make the shares of series e preferred stock convertible into shares of common stock at any time after issuance 
we also may elect to make the shares of series e preferred stock convertible  but only if i we have positive ebitda for at least one of the first three fiscal quarters of or ii we complete a public offering of equity securities for a price of at least per share and with gross proceeds to us of at least million on or before the end of the third fiscal quarter of on april  in connection with the million financing discussed below  the series e preferred stockholders exercised the convertibility option 
as a result  the series e preferred stock is no longer redeemable

telekey acquisition 
on february   we acquired telekey  inc telekey  a privately held georgia corporation the telekey acquisition 
telekey provides a range of card based telecommunications services calling  voice mail  email and others primarily to foreign academic travelers teachers and students visiting the us and canada 
telekey will operate with its existing management and personnel in existing facilities in atlanta  georgia 
as a result of the telekey acquisition  all of the shares of common stock of telekey outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the telekey acquisition were converted into  in the aggregate  a a base amount of  shares of our series f convertible preferred stock series f preferred stock at closing  b at least  and up to  shares of series f preferred stock two years later or upon a change of control or certain events of default if they occur before the end of two years  subject to telekey s meeting certain revenue and ebitda tests  c  in cash at closing and d a promissory note in the original principal amount of  payable in equal monthly installments over one year  issued at closing

debt financing 
on april   we and our wholly owned subsidiary eglobe financing corporation eglobe financing  entered into a loan and note purchase agreement with extl investors which  together with its affiliates  is our largest stockholder 
eglobe financing initially borrowed million from extl investors and we granted extl investors warrants of which are presently exercisable to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
per share 
as a condition to receiving this million unsecured loan  we entered into a subscription agreement with eglobe financing under which we have irrevocably agreed to subscribe for eglobe financing stock for an aggregate subscription price of up to million the amount necessary to repay the loan and accrued interest 
as part of the loan and note purchase agreement  extl investors agreed to purchase million of secured notes from eglobe financing  upon our request  provided that we first obtain any required stockholder approval at our next stockholder meeting 
if we issue the secured notes to extl investors  we must repay the million initial loan 
we also must grant extl investors warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  although of the initial warrants to purchase  shares will expire if we issue the secured notes 
if eglobe financing does not issue secured notes for the million after we obtain stockholder approval or if we do not obtain approval at our next annual stockholder meeting  the million loan must be repaid on the earliest to occur of i april   ii the date that we complete an offering of debt or equity securities from which we receive net proceeds of at least million or iii the occurrence of an event of default 
also  the remaining of the initial warrants to purchase  shares will become exercisable at that time 
the secured notes  if sold  must be repaid in specified monthly installments commencing on the first month following issuance  with the remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest being due in a lump sum with the last payment 
the entire amount becomes due earlier if we complete an offering of debt or equity securities from which we receive net proceeds of at least million a qualified offering 
the principal and interest of the secured notes may be paid in cash 
however  up to of the original principal amount of the secured notes may be paid in our common stock at our option if i the closing price of our common stock on nasdaq is or more for any consecutive trading days  ii we close a public offering of our equity securities at a price of at least per share and with gross proceeds to us of at least million  or iii we close a qualified offering at a price of at least per share  in the case of an offering of equity securities 
the proceeds of these financings will be used by us to fund capital expenditures relating to our network of ip trunks and intelligent platforms for calling card and unified messaging services  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the proceeds of the secured notes would also be used to repay the million initial loan and our approximately million of senior indebtedness to idt corporation 
if eglobe financing issues the secured notes  we will transfer substantially all of our operating assets to eglobe financing so that extl investors can have a security interest in our assets to secure payment under the secured notes 
the security interest would be subject to certain exceptions for existing debt and vendor financing 
we and our operating subsidiaries would guarantee payment of the secured notes 
extl investors also has agreed  under the loan and note purchase agreement  to make advances to eglobe financing from time to time based upon eligible accounts receivable 
these advances may not exceed the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable and ii the aggregate amount of principal payments made by eglobe financing under the secured notes 
we will guarantee repayment of these advances  which also will be secured by the same security arrangement as the secured notes 
the loan and note purchase agreement contains several covenants which we believe are fairly customary  including prohibitions on i mergers and sales of substantially all assets  ii sales of material assets other than on an arm s length basis and in the ordinary course  iii encumbering any of our assets except for certain permitted liens  iv incurring or having outstanding indebtedness other than certain permitted debt which includes certain existing debt and future equipment and facilities financing  or prepaying any subordinated indebtedness  or v paying any dividends or distributions on any class of our capital stock other than any dividend on outstanding preferred stock or additional preferred stock issued in the future or repurchasing any shares of our capital stock subject to certain exceptions 
the loan and note purchase agreement contains several fairly standard events of default  including i non payment of any principal or interest on the million loan or the secured notes  or non payment of  or more on any other indebtedness  ii failure to perform any obligation under the loan and note purchase agreement or related documents  iii breach of any representation or warranty in the loan and note purchase agreement  iv inability to pay our debts as they become due  or initiation or consent to judicial proceedings relating to bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization  vi dissolution or winding up  unless approved by extl investors  and vi final judgment ordering payment in excess of  other potential acquisitions 
we are currently negotiating to acquire  substantially all the assets of two other companies 
one of such companies would be acquired by a joint venture between the seller and us 
the cash element of the aggregate purchase prices for these potential acquisitions is approximately million plus financial commitments of approximately million 
in addition  we will issue preferred stock convertible into between  and million shares of common stock 
risk factors we caution you that our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties 
there are a variety of important factors like those that follow that may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or otherwise 
we have incurred significant losses  attributable in part to numerous charges we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  and a net loss of million for the nine month period ended december  we continue to incur operating losses and are likely to report net losses for the next year  due in part to large non cash charges for goodwill  amortization and amortization of debt discount 
a significant portion of the losses for the year ended march  resulted from the following charges  corporate realignment costs of million  settlement costs of million for previously existing litigation settled by new management  an additional income tax provision of million  an additional allowance for doubtful accounts of million and warrants associated with debt of million 
some of these charges resulted from a detailed review of the company s activities initiated by new management 
excluding these items  we incurred a net loss for the fiscal year ended march  of million 
of the net loss for the nine month period ended december   million was attributable to settlement costs relating to certain claims by our former chairman and largest stockholder  an additional allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and warrants associated with debt equaled million 
management has been taking steps to introduce new services and new revenues and replace lost revenues 
however  our ability to achieve profitability and positive cash flow depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to increase revenue while maintaining or reducing costs by achieving economies of scale 
a variety of factors  external and internal  may keep us from succeeding in increasing or maintaining revenue or achieving or sustaining economies of scale and positive cash flow in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we need additional capital to finance our operating and capital requirements we estimate we will need to raise up to million during the current fiscal year to have sufficient working capital to facilitate running our business  acquiring assets and technology  repaying indebtedness incurred in connection with certain acquisitions  upgrading our facilities  and developing new services 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  capital resources and other financial data 
in addition  we will need to repay or refinance our existing million term loan plus approximately million in interest that will be due and payable in full in august to the extent that we spend more on acquisitions or service development our need for additional financing will increase 
we have reached agreements to raise million in financing million from the sale of preferred stock  million of which has been received in january and february  and million of which is subject to registration of the stock million in a long term debt facility subject to stockholder approval and more than million of vendor financing 
however  there is no assurance that we will satisfy the conditions or receive the committed but unfunded financing 
if such proposed financing is not raised as expected  we will face a significant and immediate need for additional funds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the necessary funds in a timely manner or on favorable terms 
should we be unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional capital  we will be required to curtail our expansion plans 
if we do not raise enough additional capital to repay the term loan and interest by august  there will be a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our customers changed during in fiscal  we added significant new card service revenue for the first time in two years and shed a substantial portion of our existing card service revenue 
several of our largest north american calling card services customers  who accounted for approximately of our revenues during the fiscal year ended march   have substantially reduced their use of our services and can be expected to end their use of our services in the near future 
as a result  we have experienced a decline in card service revenue 
although we have added new customers for our card services  during the third quarter of and subsequently  such customers have not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset losses from existing customers 
our results of operations have been negatively and significantly affected by this change 
any further such changes could negatively and materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological and market changes create significant risks for us the markets for our services are characterized by rapidly changing technology  changes in customer needs  changes in cost structures  evolving industry standards and frequent new service and product introductions 
our future success will depend  in significant part  on our ability to develop and introduce new services  to meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis  to remain competitive with products and services based on new technologies  to modify our cost structure  to maintain cost effective services  and enhance our existing services 
we may not be successful in achieving these goals 
we  like others in our industry  believe it will be necessary to offer a suite of enhanced business communications services  and that those companies which do not offer acceptable services in a timely manner will not be able to compete successfully 
we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and market changes and we may not be able to offer acceptable new services in a timely manner to be able to compete successfully 
in addition  others may develop services or technologies that will render our services or technology noncompetitive or obsolete 
because the telecommunications services industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological advances  our ability to realize our expectations will depend on o our success at enhancing our current offerings  o our ability to develop new products and services that keep pace with developments in technology  o our ability to meet evolving customer requirements  especially ease of use requirements  o our ability to deliver those products through appropriate distribution channels  and o our ability to license technology from third parties 
this will require  among other things  that we o correctly anticipate customer needs and price our products competitively  o hire and retain personnel with the necessary skills and creativity  o provide adequate funding for development efforts  and o manage distribution channels effectively 
our competitive position and operating results could suffer if o we fail to anticipate or to respond adequately to customer requirements or to technological developments  particularly those of our competitors  and o we delay the development  production  testing  marketing  or availability of new or enhanced products or services  or customers fail to accept such products or services 
competition may affect our business adversely our industry is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
the communications industry is dominated by companies much larger than us  with much greater name recognition  larger customer bases and financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources substantially greater than ours 
to the extent that these companies offer services similar to and priced competitively with our services  there likely would be a negative effect on our pricing and revenues  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to succeed will depend in part on such larger companies outsourcing to companies such as ours services of the type we offer 
in addition  several other companies have offered or have announced intentions to offer enhanced communications services similar to certain of the enhanced services we plan to offer 
to the extent that such entities are successful in offering superior services or introducing credible service offerings before we do  we likely would be adversely affected and such effects could be material 
we expect new types of products and services not yet announced or available in the marketplace to be developed and introduced which will compete with the services we offer today and plan to offer 
our business depends on creating and maintaining strategic relationships a principal element of our strategy is to maintain our existing  and create new  strategic relationships with international carriers and others 
these relations enable or would enable us to offer additional services that we cannot offer on our own and to offer our services to a larger customer base than we could otherwise reach through our direct marketing efforts 
we believe international relationships and alliances are important in offering calling card services and that such relationships will be even more important as providers add new services 
our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and develop such relationships  the quality of these relationships and the ability of these strategic partners to market services effectively 
our failure to maintain and develop such relationships or our strategic partners failure to market our services successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are risks associated with the recent idx  uci and telekey acquisitions  and with future acquisitions we acquired idx  an ip fax and voice company  in december as a result of the idx acquisition  we added employees and two operating locations 
although we have made changes to integrate idx into our operations  to assimilate the new employees and to implement reporting  monitoring and forecasting procedures with respect to the former idx businesses  we may have difficulty implementing these steps 
in addition  the continuing integration of idx into our operations may divert management attention from our existing businesses and may result in additional administrative expense 
we acquired idx subject to a variety of existing obligations 
moreover  in our due diligence investigation of idx  we may not have discovered all matters of a material nature relating to idx and its business 
we acquired uci  a calling card services company  in december  adding one employee and one operating location 
in february  we acquired telekey  a calling card services company  adding eight employees and one operating location 
we are subject to the same risks with respect to the uci acquisition and the telekey acquisition as described in the prior paragraph with respect to the idx acquisition 
as part of our business strategy  we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of businesses and to pursue joint ventures principally relating to our current operations 
these transactions commonly involve certain risks  including  among others  that o we may experience difficulty in assimilating acquired operations  services  products and personnel  which may divert our management s attention from other business concerns  o the acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business by placing significant administrative  technical and financial demands on our systems  procedures and controls  o we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired technology and rights into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  o we may not be able to locate or acquire appropriate companies at attractive prices  o we may lack the necessary experience to enter new markets  and o an acquisition may impair our relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with future transactions 
expected benefits from future acquisitions  if any  may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame  revenues following future acquisitions may be lower than expected  and operating costs or customer loss and business disruption following future acquisitions  if any  may be greater than expected  and costs or difficulties related to the integration of the businesses  if any  that we may acquire may be greater than expected 
the purchase price allocations for the acquisitions made to date are preliminary pending resolution of certain purchase price elements 
the recorded goodwill associated with these acquisitions may materially increase when the contingencies are resolved 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
we believe that additional acquisitions may require additional capital resources 
therefore  we may be required to borrow money  or otherwise obtain financing  for future acquisitions 
if we are unable to procure suitable financing  we may be unable to complete desired acquisitions 
in addition  a transaction could materially adversely affect our operating results if we dilute our shareholders by issuing additional equity securities  incur additional debt  or amortize acquisition or debt related expenses for goodwill and other intangible assets  and write off software development costs 
we will rely on ip telephony  the regulation of which is changing and uncertain since ip telephony is a recent market development  the regulation of ip telephony is still evolving 
a number of countries currently prohibit ip telephony 
other countries permit but regulate ip telephony 
in the us  the fcc has stated that some forms of ip telephony appear to be similar to traditional telephone services  but the fcc has not decided whether  or how  to regulate providers of ip telephony 
in addition  several efforts have been made to enact us federal legislation that would either regulate or exempt from regulation services provided over the internet 
state public utility commissions also may retain intrastate jurisdiction and could initiate proceedings to regulate the intrastate aspects of ip telephony 
if governments  prohibit or regulate ip telephony  we could be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements or penalties  including without limitation  orders to cease operations or to limit future operations  loss of licenses or of license opportunities  fines  seizure of equipment and  in certain jurisdictions  criminal prosecution 
the revenue and or profit generated from internet telephony may have become a significant portion of our overall revenue and or profit at the time ip telephony is regulated and or curtailed 
any of the developments described above could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have significantly increased our outstanding shares of capital stock and we may have further dilution during the past few months  we significantly increased the number of outstanding shares of capital stock 
as described below under the caption certain recent developments  we issued series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock  series d preferred stock  series e preferred stock and series f preferred stock in connection with the idx acquisition  the telekey acquisition  the settlement with mr 
jensen and two financings 
we also granted warrants to providers of bridge loans  the former idx stockholders and the investors in the two financings 
as a result  the number of shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis has increased from million shares as of november  to million shares as of april  these figures exclude employee and director options and assume conversion of all preferred stock  exercise of all in the money options and warrants and full achievement of all earn out provisions related to certain acquisitions have been achieved by companies acquired as of april  
this has resulted in a significant reduction in the respective percentage interests of our company held by our stockholders other than those purchasing additional stock in the recent financings 
we expect to issue additional shares of capital stock in connection with financing agreements we have entered into described above and further financings  acquisitions and joint ventures 
we will be required under the terms of existing agreements to issue additional stock if the market price of our common stock does not equal subject to idx meeting its performance objectives by december of related to the stockholder litigation settlement by mid we depend on carriers and others for transmission services we do not own telecommunications transmission facilities and therefore depend on telecommunications carriers for transmission 
we generally procure these long distance telecommunication services via strategic arrangements with the carriers owning such facilities or more common commercial arrangements for the supply of transmissions capacity 
our ability to make our business profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain transmission services on favorable terms 
we believe that as providers add new and enhanced communications services  cost will be a key reason for distinguishing between services 
accordingly  we will need to keep reducing our transmission costs and pursue low cost alternative routing technologies 
failure to obtain transmission services at favorable rates could result in losses on particular services or over particular routes  and could lead to a loss of customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the asian economic crisis the continuing economic crisis in asia has had a negative impact on our revenues and prospects with asian customers 
since we expect the idx acquisition to contribute significantly to our revenues  because idx sells its services in large part to asian customers  our financial results will be tied more closely to the asian economic situation 
while we expect demand in asia to increase as the affected economies recover  we do not know when and if this recovery will occur 
the problems in asia could dampen demand for our services  including those provided by idx  which could result in a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have only limited protection of proprietary rights and technology and are exposed to risks of infringement claims we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights and technology 
however  these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may copy our technology  reverse engineer our software or otherwise obtain and use information we consider proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us our means of protecting our proprietary rights and technology may not be adequate 
in addition  it is likely that our competitors will independently develop similar technology and that we will not have any rights under existing laws to prevent the introduction or use of such technology 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the telecommunication service area 
we believe that in the ordinary course of our business third parties may claim that our current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights of such third parties 
we cannot ensure that actions or claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement will not be brought against us  or that  if such actions are brought  we will ultimately prevail 
any such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new or improved products or services  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  or cause us to stop using the challenged technology  trade name or service mark at potentially significant expense to us 
if our key technology is found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating platforms and systems may fail or be changed  exposing our business to downtime our operations depend upon protecting and maintaining our operating platforms and central processing center against damage  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and similar events 
we have taken certain precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services 
however  we cannot ensure that an event would not cause the failure of one or more of our communications platforms or even our entire network 
such an interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating platforms and networks are vulnerable to computer viruses or similar disruptive problems caused by our customers or their customers 
computer viruses or problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays  or cessation in service to our customers 
third parties could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or our customers computer systems  which could cause losses to us or our customers or deter some from subscribing to our services 
although we intend to continue to implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to information or systems  hackers have circumvented such measures in the past  and others may be able to circumvent our security measures or the security measures of our third party providers in the future 
to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches  we may have to interrupt  delay or cease service to our customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  customers or others may assert claims of liability against us as a result of any such interruption 
we depend on key management and personnel our success depends upon the continued efforts of our senior management team and our technical  marketing and sales personnel 
we believe our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of christopher j 
vizas  our chairman and chief executive officer who joined us in december  and certain other key executives 
mr 
vizas has entered into an employment agreement  which expires on december  we also believe that to be successful we must hire and retain highly qualified engineering personnel 
in particular  we rely on certain key employees to design and develop our proprietary operating platforms and related software  systems and services 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified personnel in the telecommunications services industry is intense 
hiring employees with the skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy can be extremely competitive and time consuming 
we may not be able to retain or successfully integrate existing personnel or identify and hire additional qualified personnel 
if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we do not have key man life insurance 
failure to obtain year compliance may have adverse effects on us we are aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year issue or yk issue arises because many computer and hardware systems use only two digits to represent the year 
as a result  these systems and programs may not process dates beyond the year  which may cause errors in information or system failures 
assessments of the potential effects of the yk issue vary markedly among different companies  governments  consultants  economists and commentators  and it is not possible to predict what the actual impact may be 
because we use unix based systems for our platforms and operating systems to deliver service to customers  we believe material modifications may not be required to ensure yk compliance 
however  we are in the process of assessing and testing the software resident on all our system hardware to validate this assertion and anticipate that testing will be completed by june we are in various stages of our analysis  assessment  planning and remediation and are using internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the computer system for yk compliance 
we anticipate completing all reprogramming efforts  including testing  by june management is continuing to update and evaluate the financial impact of yk compliance and expects that total costs will not exceed million 
we are proceeding with an internal certification process of our propriety systems eg operating platforms and billing systems 
we intend to use external sources as necessary to validate our certification of these critical systems 
no material costs have been incurred during the nine month period ended december  and management estimates that we will incur most of the costs during to operate our business  we rely upon providers of telecommunications services  internet services  government agencies  utility companies and other third party providers external providers 
we are also assessing the year readiness of our key external providers  and customers 
we undertook this project to assure ourselves that we would have adequate resources to cover our various telecommunications requirements 
the failure of our external providers or customers to address adequately their year readiness could affect our business adversely 
as part of our contingency planning efforts  we will identify alternative sources or strategies where necessary 
in addition  we are aware of the potential for claims against us for damages arising from products and services that are not year ready 
we believe that such claims against us would be without merit 
finally  the year presents a number of risks and uncertainties that could affect us  including utilities failures  competition for personnel skilled in the resolution of year issues and the nature of government responses to the issues  among others 
our expectations as to the extent and timeliness of modifications required to achieve year compliance is a forward looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary materially as a result of a number of factors  including  among others  those described in this paragraph 
we may not be able to successfully modify on a timely basis such products  services and systems to comply with year requirements  the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
a significant portion of our business is conducted outside of the u 
s 
external providers located outside of the u 
s 
may face significantly more severe year issues than similar entities located in the u 
s 
if such external providers located outside the united states are unable to rectify their year issues  we may be unable to effectively conduct portions of our business  which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our worst case year scenarios would include i undetected errors or uncorrected defects in our current product offerings  ii corruption of data contained in our internal information systems  and iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by external providers 
we are in the process of reviewing our contingency planning in all of these areas and expect the plans to include  among other things  the availability of support personnel to assist with customer support issues  manual work arounds for internal software failure  and substitution of systems  if needed 
we anticipate that the company will have a contingency plan in place by june  our business is exposed to the risks associated with international business we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the u 
s 
and accordingly  derive a portion of our revenues and accrue expenses in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our results of operations may be materially affected by international events and fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we do not employ foreign currency controls or other financial hedging instruments 
our international operations and business expansion plans are also subject to a variety of government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices  staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles in certain areas  potential changes in tax laws  and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights 
governments may adopt regulations or take other actions  including raising tariffs  that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business opportunities within such governments countries 
furthermore  from time to time  the political  cultural and economic climate in various national markets and regions of the world may not be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
our business is subject to regulatory risks though we do not own telecommunications transmission facilities  but instead use the facilities of other carriers  we are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions 
u 
s 
federal regulation 
under current fcc policy  telecommunications carriers reselling the services of other carriers and not owning their own telecommunications transmission facilities are considered non dominant and  as a result  are subject to streamlined regulation 
we must have an authorization from the fcc to provide international services  and must file tariffs at the fcc setting forth the terms and conditions under which we provide both international and domestic services 
these and other regulatory requirements impose a relatively minimal burden on us at the present time 
however  we cannot ensure that the current us regulatory environment and the present level of fcc regulation will continue  or that we will continue to be considered non dominant 
other government regulation 
in most countries where we operate  equipment cannot be connected to the telephone network without appropriate approvals  and therefore  we must obtain such approval to install and operate our operating platforms or other equipment 
in most jurisdictions where we conduct business we rely on our local partner to obtain the requisite authority 
relying on local partners causes us to depend entirely upon the cooperation of the telephone utilities with which we have made arrangements for our authority to conduct business  as well as operational and certain of our administrative requirements 
any telephone utility could cease to accommodate our requirements at any time 
depending upon the location of the telephone utility  such action could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
such relationships may not continue and governmental authorities may seek to regulate our services or require us to obtain a license to conduct our business 
accommodating the euro could impact our business on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro  making the euro their common legal currency on that date 
there will be a transition period between january  and january   during which the old currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro 
during the transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s former currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
conversion rates  however  will no longer be computed directly from one former currency to another 
instead  a triangular process will apply whereby an amount denominated in one former currency will first be converted into the euro 
the resultant euro denominated amount will then be converted into the second former currency 
at this time  we do not believe that the euro s introduction will have a material impact on our business during the transition period  but we cannot accurately predict the impact on our business 
our stock price will fluctuate  and could fluctuate significantly market prices for securities of telecommunications services companies have generally been volatile 
since our common stock has been publicly traded  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range and may continue to do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including  among other things o the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock  o quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results  o growth rates  o changes in estimates by analysts  o market conditions in the industry  o announcements by competitors  o regulatory actions  and o general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of high technology companies and which may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects from time to time may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we have adopted certain anti takeover provisions we have adopted a rights plan and have entered into a stockholder rights agreement dated february  between ourselves and american stock transfer trust company  as rights agent the rights agreement 
the rights agreement provides for issuing rights the rights for each share of common stock outstanding on february  each right represents the right to purchase one one hundredth of a share of our series a participating preferred stock the series a preferred stock at a price of per one hundredth of a share of series a preferred stock  subject to adjustment 
all shares of common stock we issued between the date of adoption of the rights agreement and the distribution date as defined in the rights agreement or  the date  if any  on which the rights are redeemed will have rights attached to them 
the rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain defined change of control triggering events 
the rights will have certain anti takeover effects as they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that acquires a substantial interest in us without the prior approval of our board of directors 
the effect of the rights may be to inhibit a change in control in our business including a third party tender offer at a price which reflects a premium to then prevailing trading prices that may be beneficial to our stockholders 
our restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  privileges and preferences of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of the common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that we may issue in the future 
any issuances of preferred stock in the future could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  we are subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general business corporation law  which could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change of control 
we anticipate that we will not pay cash dividends we have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock since august when we declared a stock split which we effected in the form of a ten percent stock dividend 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance growth and therefore we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our payment of cash dividends is currently subject to certain restrictions under the terms of the series d preferred stock and the series e preferred stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in  the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december this change reflects some of the more fundamental changes instituted by management 
the business of the company is to provide services to large telecommunications companies  primarily to telephone companies which are dominant in their national market  and to specialized telephone companies and to internet service providers isp s as well 
the services of the company enable its customers to provide global reach for enhanced or value added services that they are supplying  in turn  to their end user customers 
prior to  the entire focus was on supporting calling card services 
in that focus began to change 
taking advantage of the key assets of the company its operating platforms in more than forty countries  its ability to originate telephone calls and in many cases  provide data access in more than countries and territories  and the customer and operating relationships built over the years management started working with customers to extend the line of services 
a key part of that extension was the recognition that ip internet protocol technologies had become a basic element of the company s business and a principal need of its customers even the card services business relies on ip software and services in its billing and operating functions 
to support the extension of services  the company acquired idx  as discussed below  with its ip voice and fax capabilities and made significant investments in unified messaging software 
in addition  the company began exploring ways to integrate other services into its operating platforms  including additional acquisitions which might complement current offerings or extend the company s portfolio of services 
after a year of restructuring and refocus  the company is implementing its new  broader services strategy and leaves committed to a program of growth 
this program will demand substantial new resources  particularly human resources and cash 
for these reasons  in the first quarter of the company raised million from the sale of equity  arranged a million debt facility from an affiliate of a major stockholder  entered into a key vendor financing arrangement and plans to raise substantial amounts of additional capital during the next two years 
growth in international telecommunications business often results in a disparity between cash outlays and inflows during periods of growth  with outlays far exceeding inflows 
the company has entered such a period of growth 
management expects to invest in growth 
cash will be the key element of that investment whether it takes the form of recruiting personnel  acquiring technology  expanding facilities  or extending the business base through marketing or acquisitions 
in  the company made two principal investments in growth the acquisition of idx and the investment in  and the acquisition of a technology license for  unified messaging technology 
on december   the company acquired idx international  inc idx which provides ip internet protocol voice and fax transmission services  principally to telephone companies and isp s 
the company acquired all of the common and preferred stock of idx for a  shares of series b convertible preferred stock valued at million which is convertible into a maximum of  shares  shares until stockholder approval is obtained of common stock  b warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock subject to stockholder approval and to idx meeting earnout objectives described below  c million in convertible subordinated promissory notes idx notes subject to adjustment as described below  d million in bridge loan advances to idx made by the company prior the acquisition which were converted into part of the purchase price plus accrued interest charges of million and e direct costs associated with the acquisition of million 
the company plans to include the requests for the approval of the warrants and additional stock as matters to be voted upon by the stockholders at the next annual meeting 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the financial statements of the company reflect the preliminary allocation of the purchase price 
the preliminary allocation has resulted in acquired goodwill of million  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
the allocation has not been finalized due to several purchase price elements which are contingent upon working capital levels  stockholder approvals subsequent to the date of acquisition  idx s ability to achieve certain revenue and ebitda objectives twelve months after the date of close and the stock price of the company s common stock during the same twelve month period 
based on the contingent price elements discussed above  goodwill associated with the acquisition may materially increase when these contingencies are resolved 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the consolidated revenues and costs for the period ended december  included the idx results of operations for the month of december which are not material to the consolidated financial statements 
for the fiscal year ending december   however  the company expects the idx services to become a significant source of revenue growth 
the company made a cash investment of more than million in unified messaging technology in the nine months ended december  most of those funds consisted of advances to a software based service company in which the company is considering making a joint venture investment 
for the investment  the company received a technology license and has participated in the development and beta testing of the core software 
the company is preparing to launch a new service in cooperation with some of its existing customers based on this technology 
while the company does not expect significant revenues or returns from this investment in  it believes that ip and voice services based on this technology will become a significant portion of its business in and beyond 
for this reason  management plans to continue its investment in this software in and may enter into a joint venture arrangement which will give it a greater voice in the further development of the software 
revenue 
through december   most of the revenue of the company resulted from providing services and was generated through contracts for card services  the sale of international toll free services  and to a limited degree  by use of the company s legacy proprietary calling cards 
the charge for service is on a per call basis  determined primarily by minutes of use and the originating and terminating points of the call 
the charging structure for idx is substantially similar 
some contracts call for monthly minimums and almost all contracts are multi year agreements 
as the company begins to provide new services  it expects its model for charging for services to remain basically the same  although in certain new offerings  such as unified messaging  there are likely to be basic monthly subscriber charges in addition to per transaction charges 
in prior years  the company generated revenue from other sources  generally sales of billing and platform systems and nonrecurring special projects 
costs 
the principal component of the cost of revenue for card services and ip voice and fax services is transmission costs 
the company continues to pursue strategies for reducing costs of transmission 
these strategies include establishing partnering arrangements with various carriers  negotiating more cost effective agreements with other carriers and routing traffic to the lowest cost  highest quality providers 
also  in fiscal year and thereafter  the strategy will include cost effective provisioning of the company s own ip trunks 
other components of operating costs are selling  general and administrative expenses  which include personnel costs  consulting and legal fees  travel expenses  bad debt allowances and other administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the allocation of the cost of transmission equipment  property and office equipment  and various intangible assets  principally goodwill arising from several recent acquisitions  over their useful lives 
results of operations nine month period ended december  compared to year ended march  overview 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the nine month period ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended march  the table below shows a comparative summary of certain significant charges to income in both periods  some of which are nonrecurring  which affected net operating results in millions nine month period ended year ended march december   corporate realignment costs proxy related litigation settlement costs settlement costs additional income tax provision allowance and write offs for bad debts warrants associated with debt other items after deducting these items  the loss for the nine month period ended december  totaled million compared to million for the full year ended march  the principal factors in the loss for the nine month period are reduction in business arrangements  including the termination of contracts or business arrangements which did not fit with the focus of the company  reduction in prices to provide more competitive offerings  more aggressive collection efforts  including demands for timely payments from customers with outstanding delinquent accounts  which resulted in a substantial decline in revenues from what had formerly been the largest customer of the company  a continuing decline in revenue from non core  but large  north american customers  the inclusion of revenue from a major card service contract which  in the first phase of this contract in the fourth calendar quarter of  was billed largely on a cost reimbursable basis  and continued weakness in our asian customer base during the entire nine month period 
the negative effect of these factors on gross profit contribution is estimated to be million for the nine month period ended december  management has taken steps to reverse this trend through the expansion of its service offerings to its existing customers  expansion of the customer base through revamped sales and marketing and through acquisitions 
management believes that these steps will result in significant revenue growth throughout and an improvement in margins beginning in the second and third quarters of revenue 
revenue for the nine month period ended december  totaled million compared to million for the full year ended march  of this total  million was derived from the card services customer base with which the company began the period the legacy customer base 
for the six months ended september   revenue from our legacy calling card customer base averaged million per quarter 
for the fiscal year ended march  services revenue averaged approximately million per quarter 
as discussed above  revenue from this legacy customer base declined over the period and represented only million in the quarter ended december  these declines from the legacy customer base are expected to be permanent with the exception of the decline in asia and are derived largely from north american customers  including particularly the large customer which had substantial delinquencies in payment 
the legacy customers that represent most of the decline are not crucial to the company s network of operating platforms nor to the global growth strategy and the extension of services upon which management is focusing 
offsetting this decline somewhat is the inclusion in revenue for the nine month period ended december  of million  mainly in the last three months  from a significant card services contract with a new north american customer 
however  in the first phase of this contract  the company agreed to bill this customer on a cost reimbursable basis for the major portion of this business 
accordingly  this revenue source has contributed only a minor amount of margin to the company s operating results to date 
in  the company has begun a second phase of the contract which is expected to provide higher revenue and margins than the cost reimbursable basis experienced in the quarter ended december  revenue from the company s asian card service base was million for the nine month period ended december  compared to million for the year ended march  economic activity in most areas of the asia pacific region remains weak and the company s near term outlook for card services revenue in this market is that it will continue at current levels 
however  the company anticipates that a significant portion of the expected revenue growth from new services  such as those acquired with idx  will come from this region 
also included in the consolidated revenue for the nine month period ended december  is million  which represents idx revenues for the month of december based on new contracts executed during late and the first quarter of  revenue contribution from idx is expected to be significant in calendar gross profit 
gross profit was of total revenue or million for the nine month period ended december   compared to or million for the full year ended march  excluding the effects of the low margin first phase of the large new card services contract described above  gross profit from the company s card service business was for the nine month period ended december  this margin improvement over that realized in the previous year is due primarily to active efforts to reduce operating costs 
cost of revenue is expected to continue to fluctuate as new pricing and contractual arrangements are put in place and as the company s revenue mix continues to change 
transmission costs  the principal element of cost of service  should also begin to show the positive impact in arising from use of the expanding ip transmission network of idx 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
these expenses totaled million for the nine month period ended december  compared to million for the full year ended march  included in the nine month total is a million provision for doubtful accounts compared to million for the full year ended march  in the fourth calendar quarter of  the company incurred a non cash charge of million for compensation expense related to the idx acquisition for a granting by the idx stockholders of acquisition consideration to a number of idx employees 
excluding this charge  other sg a expenses  principally salaries and benefits  travel  legal and professional fees and other overhead costs averaged million per quarter during the nine month period ended december   compared to million per quarter for the year ended march  the principal factors in this increase are higher personnel costs resulting from recruitment and upgrading of management and additions to the marketing and sales staff 
settlement costs 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company and its largest stockholder entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all current and future claims 
the difference in value between the convertible preferred stock issued to the stockholder and the common stock surrendered by the stockholder was million  which resulted in a non cash charge to the statement of operations in the quarter ended september depreciation and amortization expense 
this expense for the nine month period ended december  totaled million compared to million for the full year ended march  these charges are expected to increase significantly in the future as the full effect of amortization of goodwill arising from recent acquisitions is charged to the statement of operations 
other expenses income 
interest expense totaled million for the nine month period ended december  compared to million for the full year ended march  this cost will increase in future reporting periods due to the increase in debt assumed as part of the acquisition program in and as well as the million in financing finalized in april the company recorded a foreign currency transaction loss of million during the nine month period ended december  arising from foreign currency cash and accounts receivable balances maintained by the company during the period in which the us dollar strengthened 
for the year ended march   this charge was million 
the company s exposure to foreign currency losses is mitigated due to the variety of customers and markets which comprise the company s customer base  as well as geographic diversification of that customer base 
in addition  the majority of the company s largest customers settle their accounts in us dollars 
during the nine months ended december   the company incurred million proxy related litigation expenses as compared to million for the year ended march  related to the class action lawsuit for which a settlement agreement was reached in april of the amount recorded in the year ended march   million related to the escrow of  shares of the company s common stock  which have been valued at per share pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement 
such value relates to the company s obligation to issue additional stock or cash if the market price of the company s stock is less than per share during the defined periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
taxes on income 
no income tax provision was recorded for the nine month period ended december  due to the operating losses incurred 
taxes on income for the year ended march  were million 
the tax provision for amounts currently due is primarily the result of the company s completion of a study to simplify its tax and corporate structure wherein it identified potential tax issues arising out of its international subsidiaries 
in connection with this study  the company realized it had potential tax liabilities and recorded an additional tax provision of million in the fourth quarter of the year ended march  the company s study was completed in january  and no additional reserve for taxes was recorded as of december  the eventual outcome cannot be predicted with certainty 
no tax claims have been asserted against the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding taxes on income 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  overview 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the year ended march   of which million is attributable to the following charges in millions corporate realignment costs proxy related litigation settlement costs additional income tax provision additional allowance for doubtful accounts warrants associated with debt other items some of these charges resulted principally from a detailed review of the company s activities initiated by new management in the last few months of fiscal and are described in more detail below 
excluding these items  the company incurred a net loss for the year ended march  of million compared to net income in fiscal of million 
the difference is principally due to a million contribution to net income in fiscal of revenues from non services sources which did not recur in fiscal also in the year ended march   the company s gross profit from its services business remained flat compared to fiscal while it incurred additional recurring operating expenses of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
interest expense  excluding a million charge related to the amortization of debt discount associated with warrants see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information  increased by million over fiscal foreign exchange losses increased by million over fiscal new management has taken steps to increase revenues and improve margins 
they have completed a review of the operations and activities of the company and have refocused the company s marketing and sales activities with an emphasis on stabilizing and growing the existing core business and on adding new services 
in practical terms  this means that the company refocused its resources on both expanding its customer base and extending its line of services to realize the value of its global network of operating platforms  the company established a small staff devoted to improving its network structure and reducing its marginal transmission costs and  therefore  its cost of revenue  and contracts were entered into which will help to reduce transmission costs in the next fiscal year  the company increased its sales and marketing staff and allocated additional funds for marketing and promotional activities  and staffing needs were assessed and reductions and realignments were completed 
the company instituted a process to add new network and operations staff as necessary to support new contracts 
a thorough review of corporate practices and procedures was completed in this review resulted in a number of improvements to internal reporting and review procedures

although total revenue decreased from the year ended march  to the year ended march   services revenue increased million or 
the increase was due to increased customer usage partially offset by a combination of three elements a decline in revenue from the long distance resale services of the company  lower per minute revenue due to new pricing programs which went into effect in the first and second quarters of the year ended  and a lack of new revenue generating contracts in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit 
gross profit was or million for the year ended march   compared to or million for the year ended march  this decline was due partially to the positive margin contribution of non service revenues in the year ended march  which did not reoccur in the year ended march  excluding the effects of non service revenue  gross profit for services revenue was for the year ended march  compared to for fiscal this decrease was due to lower pricing related to various customer contracts which was not offset by corresponding decreases in transmission costs  the principal component of cost of revenue 
cost of revenue was expected to fluctuate in the next few periods as new pricing and contractual arrangements were put in place and as the company worked to improve its network structure and transmission costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended march   compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of million or 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
a major factor in the increase was the addition of million to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
of this amount  half was related to one customer who  in the company s view  unilaterally took unsubstantiated credits off invoiced amounts and refused to pay a large invoice for contract settlement charges related to a special project 
the company had an allowance as of march  to reflect potential costs of collection 
in the quarter ending december   the company recovered million in cash and a million usage credit from this customer 
this settlement resulted in no additional write off for bad debts 
the balance of the remaining increase in the allowance was spread among several accounts  principally in the asia pacific area  to provide for collection issues that may arise from economic and other factors 
the company incurred million in other selling  general and administrative expenses related to increases in payroll due to the hiring of new management and other personnel  consulting and legal fees  travel expenses and for internal communication costs

of this amount  million related to the escrow of  shares of the company s common stock  which was valued at per share pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement 
such value related to the company s obligation to issue additional stock or cash if the market price of the company s stock is less than per share during the defined periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
taxes on income 
taxes on income for the year ended march  were million  with no comparable tax provision for the year ended march  this tax provision was primarily the result of the company s study to simplify its tax structure wherein it identified potential international tax issues and realized it had potential tax liabilities 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding taxes on income 
liquidity  capital resources and other financial data as discussed above  management launched an aggressive growth plan toward the end of and intends to pursue that plan into the foreseeable future 
a result of that plan will be increasing cash demands and the need for aggressive cash management 
to accomplish all that it seeks to do  management will have to acquire significant financing  some of which it has already achieved in the first quarter of cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at march  accounts payable totaled million at december  compared to million at march   resulting principally from deferrals of payments to certain vendors and professional service firms due to the company s tight cash situation see discussion below for financings in the first quarter of which were used  in part  to bring these companies and firms more current 
accrued expenses increased by million to million at december  primarily due to accruals for interest costs on debt payable only at maturity and costs accrued for acquisitions and transmission for which no bills had been received as of december  cash inflows from operating activities for the nine month period ended december  totaled million  compared to outflows of million for the full year ended march  there was a net working capital deficiency of million at december  compared to positive working capital of million at march  in addition to the company s operating losses  this large change in working capital resulted principally from the reclassification of million of debt due in august million and december million to a current liability as of december  and to short term indebtedness totaling million incurred primarily during the fourth calendar quarter of related to acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
of this latter amount  up to million plus accrued interest may be paid  at the company s sole discretion  by issuance of common stock 
the first million was repaid by the issuance of common stock in march in the nine month period ended december   in addition to the million paid in connection with the acquisition of idx  the company acquired property and equipment of approximately million and made other investments  principally advances totaling million to the unified messaging company which provides the software upon which the company is basing its new messaging service and in which the company is considering making a joint venture investment 
this compares to million in property and equipment additions for the full year ended march  in both periods  the property and equipment expenditures were principally for upgrades and additions to the global network of operating platforms 
cash generated from financing activities totaled million during the nine month period ended december   mainly due to proceeds from a million loan from an existing stockholder received in june  which is payable in december for the full year ended march   cash generated from financing activities totaled million  the primary source being the issuance of common stock for million reduced by the net retirement of long debt obligations of million 
in january and february   the company entered into two separate financing transactions through the issuance of preferred stock and warrants totaling million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
proceeds from these financings to date are million with the remaining million to be received upon registering the underlying common stock issuable on conversion 
substantially all of the proceeds from these financings have been used during the first quarter of to reduce accounts payable and to meet the capital expenditure and working capital requirements of the business 
in february  the company acquired telekey  a communications services company  with a card based range of services including calling  e mail  voicemail and other features which will be incorporated in the expanded service offerings of the company 
telekey was acquired for cash  short term notes of million and convertible preferred stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the company obtained a financing commitment in the form of long term debt totaling million from an affiliate of the company s largest stockholder 
this commitment is subject to stockholder approval see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the lender provided a loan of million with a term of one year which is intended to serve as a bridge to stockholder approval or the acquisition of other financing 
current funding requirements 
the company has the following estimated firm cash obligations and requirements during calendar in millions repayment of loans due august and december  including interest payment of promissory note issued in connection with acquisition payment of estimated tax obligations related to prior years yk compliance program see below through april   the company acquired new funding and commitments in excess of million million from the sale of convertible stock of which the million has been received and million will be advanced upon registration of the underlying common shares  million in committed long term debt which is subject to stockholder approval under the commitment  the lender has provided a bridge loan of million which the company has drawn down  and million or more in vendor financing for network equipment purchases 
assuming that stockholder approval is forthcoming for the long term debt  these funds might permit the company to meet a modest baseline growth plan 
to achieve the growth  both short and long term  that management is targeting  however  will require additional capital 
the plan under which the company is currently operating requires cash in the second half of the year which the company anticipates will come from a capital markets financing of debt or equity in the second half of the year of up to million  and secured equipment based financing of up to million 
the company s growth plan contemplates  in addition to the firm cash obligations noted above  additional capital needs of up to million including expenditures for the first quarter which  as noted above  used most of the million in proceeds from the sale of convertible stock 
most of these funds will be used for network expansion and upgrade  for the extension of the line of services  for a few key acquisitions and investments  and  in particular  for the launch of new services  such as the messaging service 
if significantly less capital is available  plans will need to be curtailed  negatively affecting growth  particularly the launch of new services 
of the financing currently committed  million is subject to stockholder approval at the company s next annual meeting scheduled to occur in the second quarter of the company s management believes that there is a high probability that stockholder approval will be obtained 
however  if this approval does not occur  the company will be required to find additional sources of capital in the short term  principally to repay the indebtedness including interest of million due in august in that event  there can be no assurance that the company can raise additional capital or generate sufficient funds from operations to meet its obligations 
the lack of funds from these sources would force the company to curtail its existing and planned levels of operations and would therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
taxes during  the company undertook a study to simplify its organizational and tax structure and identified potential international tax issues 
in connection with this study  the company determined that it had potential tax liabilities and recorded an additional tax provision of million in the year ended march  to reserve against liabilities which could have arisen under the existing structure 
the company initiated discussions with the internal revenue service irs related to the u 
s 
federal income tax issues identified by the study and filed with the irs returns for the company for the years ended march  through reflecting these findings 
neither the eventual outcome of these discussions or of any other issues can be predicted with certainty 
as of december   the company has recorded a net deferred tax asset of million and has approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards available 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset as management has not been able to determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized based in part on the foreign operations and availability of the operating loss carryforwards to offset only us tax provisions 
in addition  included in the net operating carryforwards are approximately million acquired in the idx acquisition that are limited in use to approximately million per year and must be offset only by taxable income generated from idx 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding further discussion of taxes on income 
effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations to date 
accounting pronouncements and year issues recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair market value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is currently not applicable to the company 
year issues the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year issue or yk issue arises because many computer and hardware systems use only two digits to represent the year 
as a result  these systems and programs may not process dates beyond the year  which may cause errors in information or system failures 
assessments of the potential effects of the yk issue vary markedly among different companies  governments  consultants  economists and commentators  and it is not possible to predict what the actual impact may be 
because the company uses unix based systems for its platforms and operating systems to deliver service to customers  the company believes material modifications may not be required to ensure yk compliance 
however  the company is in the process of assessing and testing the software resident on all its system hardware to validate this assertion and anticipate that testing will be completed by june the company is in various stages of its analysis  assessment  planning and remediation and is using internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the computer system for yk compliance 
the company anticipates completing all reprogramming efforts  including testing  by june management is continuing to update and evaluate the financial impact of yk compliance and expects that total costs will not exceed million 
the company is proceeding with an internal certification process of its propriety systems eg calling card and billing systems 
the company intends to use external sources as necessary to validate our certification of these critical systems 
no material costs have been incurred during the nine month period ended december  and management estimates that the company will incur most of the costs during the company is also in the process of assessing year readiness of its key suppliers and customers 
this project has been undertaken with a view toward assuring that the company has adequate resources to cover its various telecommunications requirements 
a failure of the company s suppliers or customers to address adequately their year readiness could affect the company s business adversely 
the company s worst case year scenarios would include i undetected errors or uncorrected defects in its current product offerings  ii corruption of data contained in its internal information systems  and iii the failure of infrastructure services provided by external providers 
the company is in the process of reviewing its contingency planning in all of these areas and expects the plans to include  among other things  the availability of support personnel to assist with customer support issues  manual work arounds for internal software failure  and substitution of systems  if needed 
the company anticipates that it will have a contingency plan in place by june in addition  the company is aware of the potential for claims against it for damages arising from products and services that are not year ready 
the company believes that such claims against it would be without merit 
finally  the year presents a number of risks and uncertainties that could affect the company  including utilities failures  competition for personnel skilled in the resolution of year issues and the nature of government responses to the issues among others 
the company s expectations as to the extent and timeliness of modifications required in order to achieve year compliance is a forward looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary materially as a result of a number of factors  including  among others  those described in this paragraph 
there can be no assurance however  that the company will be able to successfully modify on a timely basis such products  services and systems to comply with year requirements  which failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company measures its exposure to market risk at any point in time by comparing the open positions to a market risk of fair value 
the market prices the company uses to determine fair value are based on management s best estimates  which consider various factors including closing exchange prices  volatility factors and the time value of money 
at december   the company was exposed to some market risk through interest rates on its long term debt and preferred stock and foreign currency 
at december   the company s exposure to market risk was not material
