the effective pro forma income tax rate for the fifty two weeks ended december  was and the effective pro forma income tax rate for the fifty two weeks ended december  was 
this decrease was primarily due to the impact of tax exempt interest income earned during quarterly fluctuations  seasonality and inflation as a result of the revenues associated with each new location  the timing of new unit openings will result in significant fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company expects seasonality to be a factor in the operation or results of its business in the future due to expected lower second and third quarter revenues due to the summer season 
the primary inflationary factors affecting the company s operations include food  liquor and labor costs 
although a large number of the company s restaurant personnel are paid at the federal minimum wage level  the majority of personnel are tipped employees  and therefore  recent as well as future minimum wage changes are likely to have very little effect on labor costs 
as costs of food and labor have increased  the company has historically been able to offset these increases through economies of scale and improved operating procedures 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on operating margins 
liquidity and capital resources the company was formed on february  and  pursuant to the exchange on february   the company became the owner of the eight then existing bailey s locations and three then existing fox hound locations 
prior to the exchange  bailey s financed its expansion primarily with loans from stockholders and loans from banks 
prior to the exchange  fox hound financed its expansion primarily with partners equity contributions and loans from related parties 
as is customary in the restaurant industry  prior to the initial public offering the company had operated with negative working capital 
the company does not have significant receivables or inventory and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms in purchasing food and supplies 
because funds available from cash sales are not needed immediately to pay for food and supplies  or to finance inventory  they may be considered as a source of financing for noncurrent capital expenditures 
immediately following the initial public offering  the company repaid outstanding indebtedness to intrust bank  na  wichita  in the principal amount of approximately million out of a total credit line of million available to the company 
this outstanding indebtedness was incurred to refinance the debt of the acquired entities in the exchange of approximately million and to finance the stockholder dividend payment to the former stockholders of bailey s of approximately million 
on september  the company entered into a loan agreement with intrust bank  na the facility which provides for a line of credit of  subject to certain limitations based on earnings before interest  interest taxes  depreciation and amortization of the past fifty two weeks 
the facility requires monthly payments of interest only until november   at which time equal monthly installments of principal and interest are required as necessary to fully amortize the outstanding indebtedness plus future interest over a period of four years 
interest is accrued at a rate of below the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
proceeds from the facility were used for restaurant development 
as of december   the company had borrowed  under the facility 
the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash flows from operations were  and purchases of property and equipment were  for the weeks ended december  the company intends to open up to eight entertainment restaurant locations in five of which were opened during the first quarter of and between to locations in the company expects to expend approximately million to open new locations over the next months 
the company believes the funds available from the facility and its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s operating plans  the acceleration of the company s expansion plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events will not cause the company to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated  prevent the company from achieving the goals of its expansion strategy or prevent any newly opened locations from operating profitably 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
year compliance the company utilizes and is dependent upon computer systems and software to conduct its business 
in  the company initiated a review and assessment of all hardware and software to confirm they will function properly in the year the systems and software include those developed and maintained by fsc in house computer department as well as purchased software which is run on in house computer systems  including pos systems and back of house systems in the units 
the systems and software utilized by fsc are believed to be year compliant 
the company is currently undergoing an upgrade of its pos and back of house systems to allow for a seamless interface with its home office accounting systems 
certain back of house applications which were not year compliant will be made compliant as part of this upgrade 
this upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter  at which time all systems and software are expected to be year compliant 
the total cost of this upgrade including updating the hardware and software as well as training costs is expected to be between  and  management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year project 
in the event the company does not complete any aditional phases  the company might be unable to process transactional and financial reporting information 
in addition  disruption in the economy generally resulting from the year issued could also materially adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure  for example  equipment shutdown or failure to properly date business records 
th eamount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  amont other actions  manual workarounds and adjusting staffing agencies
