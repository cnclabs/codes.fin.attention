financial condition liquidity and capital commitments years ended december  cash flows from used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    the company uses the net cash generated from its operations and from external financing to fund capital expenditures for network expansion and modernization  and invest in new businesses 
the company s sources of funds  primarily from operations and  to the extent necessary  from readily available external financing arrangements  are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements 
we expect that presently foreseeable capital requirements will be financed primarily through internally generated funds 
additional debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional development activities or to maintain our capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility 
on december   the company had commitments totaling million  including commitments to purchase equipment and materials to continue the upgrade of its telecommunications plant base and to build the pcs network 
the company plans to finance its projected capital budget requirements for totaling million from internally generated funds  and possibly some short term financing 
cash flows from operating activities our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations 
taking into account net income plus the various adjustments for depreciation and amortization and eliminating the gain on sale of investment assets  the cash flows from operating activities in were million 
although net income for accounting purposes is decreased by the amortization of the goodwill arising from the acquisitions of bvt and inf and the higher depreciation expenses arising from the capital investment in pcs  amortization and depreciation are non cash expenses and  consequently  a source of cash that the company can use for the capital investments necessary to maintain and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued upgrade its network and build and develop pcs 
cash flows used in investing activities capital expenditures are the company s primary use of cash resources 
the company s capital expenditures in included million for the company s local exchange operations and million for the build out and development of its pcs operation 
the investment in local exchange operations was consistent with the investments made in and the investment in the pcs operation was million in compared to million in and  in the investments are made to support the company s businesses in order to facilitate the introduction of new products and services  enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges and increase the operating efficiency and productivity of its networks

during  the company received proceeds in excess of million from the liquidation of its partnership interest in brace and in received approximately million from the sale of its partnership interest in lace 
in  it also received proceeds totaling  from the sale of equity securities 
substantial amounts of additional capital will be needed for the remaining build out of the pcs network 
cwc s capital requirements over the next several years to complete the build out of its entire pcs network could exceed million 
additional financing could come from internal sources  long term debt  common stock issue  or a combination of the three 
cash flows used in financing activities as in prior years  dividend payments were a significant use of cash

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued equity investments the company has continued to invest in the future of the telecommunications industry through the ownership of the publicly traded stock of other telecommunication companies 
during  the company s total investment in this stock increased due to unrealized appreciation 
the current market value of the company s investment stock is million 
management views this investment as a source of future liquidity 
in february   the company sold some of its investment stock for  other factors personal communication services pcs cwc began commercial operations as a provider of wireless telecommunications services in may  by the end of the year it had base stations in service throughout the reading  sunbury and williamsport areas 
cwc plans to put an additional base stations into service during  to augment coverage in those markets 
cwc holds licenses to provide wireless services known as personal communication services pcs in radio spectrum in the d and f blocks 
pcs is a wireless communications service based on lower power and a higher frequency bandwidth than cellular service 
pcs is anticipated to be more reliable  of better quality and less expensive for the customer  than cellular 
the basic trading areas in which cwc holds licenses are reading  pottsville  sunbury  and williamsport  pennsylvania  covering nine counties in pennsylvania 
management views participation in pcs as an important part of its future business 
pcs is expected to be a reliable  convenient and inexpensive vehicle for providing wireless telephone service 
it will provide the company with an opportunity to expand its business into neighboring territories while maintaining the company s current customer base 
the development of the pcs network and business is subject to the risks and delays associated with the design and construction of the wireless system and the commencement of a new business 
the company has already invested almost million in the pcs network and business and could invest an additional million over the next five years 
the company has projected pcs operating losses for the near future 
the capital cost of the pcs system  the depreciation expense of the pcs assets  and the projected pcs operating losses will significantly impact the company s earnings 
effects of substantial indebtedness and preferred stock on future operations at december   the company had approximately million of long term debt outstanding and approximately million of redeemable preferred stock  compared to approximately million of common equity 
this resulted in a ratio of debt and preferred stock to equity 
at december  the ratio was debt to equity 
the increased debt ratio reflects the debt incurred in february  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued although a higher level of debt and preferred stock is not unusual in the telecommunications industry  the additional debt and preferred stock may have important consequences on the company s future operations  including i the company will incur additional interest expense and significant principal repayment obligations  ii the company is subject to significant unscheduled preferred stock redemption obligations  iii the company s increased leverage may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and iv payment of dividends on the company s common shares may be restricted by the level of financial resources needed to service the company s additional debt and preferred stock 
regulated industry ctt  and bvt are subject to a rate making process regulated jointly by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc and the federal communications commission fcc called rate of return regulation 
an amendment to the pennsylvania public utility act passed in  provides for streamlined rate regulation and a method for determining rates other than the rate of return regulation and procedures for the state jurisdiction 
this new regulation referred to as chapter  provides a price stability mechanism in which a telephone company s annual revenues from non competitive services may be permitted to change in line with the gross domestic producer price index  minus a productivity offset  with no limitation on earnings by the regulated company 
in order for the company to avail itself of the procedures permitted by chapter  ctt and bvt must commit to providing universal broadband services by both companies filed chapter plans in july and approval is expected in june the telecommunication industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  which may have a significant impact on financial performance 
the federal telecommunications act of  creates a regulatory environment that encourages competition 
as rural companies  ctt and bvt are exempt from many of the most onerous aspects of competition  unless prospective competitors can pass a public interest standard and agree to offer service throughout the telephone companies territories 
in addition  in march ctt and bvt received approval by the pennsylvania puc of a petition that has significantly strengthened the companies competitive position 
management believes that competition will continue to bring many new opportunities for the local exchange companies 
management is endeavoring to position the company to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise  and remains optimistic about the future 
during cci significantly grew its long distance business both in the ctt and bvt franchise territories  as well a surrounding areas 
in addition cci s competitive local telephone business became operational in and began offering service in bell atlantic s franchise territory 
strong growth in this business segment is anticipated in accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas the company follows the accounting statement which recognizes the economic effect of rate regulation by recording costs and return on investment as such amounts are recovered through regulatory authorized rates 
as of december   the company had no regulated assets but had regulated liabilities totaling thousand 
the company currently expects to follow the accounting practices prescribed by sfas in the foreseeable future  but  if the company discontinued this practice  the effect of writing off any regulatory assets and liabilities would not be material to the company s operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year potential problems the information provided below constitutes a year readiness disclosure for purposes of the year information and readiness act 
the year yk problem arises from the use of a two digit field to identify years in computer programs  eg   and the assumption of a single century  the s 
any program so created may read  or attempt to read  as the year there are two other related issues which could also lead to incorrect calculations or failure  such as i some systems programming assigns special meaning to certain dates  such as  and ii the year is a leap year 
accordingly  some computer hardware and software  including programs embedded within machinery and parts  will need to be modified prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company is heavily dependent on computer systems and utilizes a significant number of software programs and operating systems throughout the organization 
to the extent the software applications are unable to interpret the calendar year  some level of modification or replacement of these applications will be necessary 
the company is also very dependent on vendor compliance and will require them to represent that their systems are year compliant 
the company is addressing the year problem 
it has appointed a task force to assess the scope of the risk and to bring its applications into compliance 
this has included utilizing outside service organizations 
conestoga s digital network and all major billing and information systems have been tested and should be ready for the year potential problems which are out of the company s control could present themselves  such as customer owned premise equipment that is attached to conestoga s network 
the potential costs from such third party problems are difficult to estimate 
no assurance can be given that all of the company s third party systems are or will be year compliant 
however  the company does not believe that the costs required to address such problems will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  but it cannot be certain given the complexities of the interactions of its systems with the systems of third parties 
effects of inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating revenues and expenses over the past three years have been immaterial
