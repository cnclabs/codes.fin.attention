item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the company and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview the company  through its steinway and selmer subsidiaries  is one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
the company s net sales and income from operations improved and  respectively  for compared to the company believes that these operating performance improvements have resulted from the company s strategy to capitalize on its strong brand names  leading market positions  and emphasis on quality products 
the company s net sales of million for the year ended december  were comprised of steinway piano sales of million and selmer band and orchestral instrument sales of million 
steinway s piano sales are influenced by general economic conditions in the united states and europe  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
steinway s operating results are primarily affected by grand piano sales 
given the total number of grand pianos sold by steinway in any year  sold in  a decrease of a relatively few number of units being sold by steinway can have a material impact on the company s business and operating results 
domestic grand piano unit shipments have increased from to  largely attributable to the strong us economy as well as increased selling and marketing efforts 
grand piano unit shipments to international markets have remained relatively flat over the same period reflecting the weakness of the european and asian economies 
in  approximately of steinway s sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
selmer student instrument sales are strongly influenced by trends in school enrollment and general attitudes toward music and the arts 
the school instrument business is generally resistant to macroeconomic cycles and strongly correlated to the number of school children in the united states  which is expected to grow steadily through beginner instruments accounted for of selmer s unit shipments and of instrument revenues in with advanced and professional instruments representing the balance 
selmer student instrument sales were affected by the weak foreign markets in the strong us economy attracted both domestic and foreign manufacturers who were experiencing declines in international shipments during the year 
this created an oversupply of instruments which  coupled with pricing pressures  resulted in a highly competitive domestic market 
the decrease in foreign shipments  as well as the increased domestic competition  resulted in an overall decline in selmer s unit shipments in despite this decline  selmer s unit shipments and sales have grown an average of and per year  since the unit and sales growth is the result of management s efforts to capitalize on the favorable demographic trends and the generally positive attitudes towards music education by parents 
although the company cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on its operations  it does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represent approximately of consolidated sales  with steinway s international sales accounting for over of these international sales 
a significant portion of steinway s international sales originate from its german manufacturing facility  resulting in sales  cost of sales and related operating expenses denominated in deutsche marks 
while currency translation has affected international sales  cost of sales and related operating expenses  it has not had a material impact on operating income 
the company utilizes financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the company does not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
the company believes the introduction of the euro over the next three years will have a positive long term impact on its business  as consistent prices throughout europe will create a more favorable selling environment for its products 
the company s effective tax rates vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income foreign income generally  and german income in particular  bear higher rates of tax and absorption of foreign tax credits in the us 
in  german income decreased relative to total income and the rate of credit absorption increased 
this shift in income combined with certain tax saving strategies reduced the company s effective tax rate from in to in the company has historically grown through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
recent acquisitions have included emerson musical instruments in january and the kluge group of companies in december the following discussion includes each of these businesses since its date of acquisition

band and orchestral instrument sales remained essentially flat in a decline in foreign shipments and a highly competitive domestic market caused a decrease in band and orchestral instrument shipments for the year 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million 
gross margins remained flat at in both years 
piano margins improved to in from in this improvement is primarily due to greater efficiencies associated with higher levels of piano production combined with a yen driven reduction in costs of the boston piano line of approximately million 
band instrument margins were negatively impacted by manufacturing inefficiencies experienced with the introduction of a new student saxophone  resulting in a decline in margins from in to in operating expenses operating expenses increased only million to million in overall  operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in income from operations income from operations increased by million to million in these improved earnings resulted from increased sales combined with firm control over operating expenses

band and orchestral instrument sales increased million in the acquisition of emerson contributed million of the band sales increase 
total instrument shipments increased for the year 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million

operating expenses operating expenses increased million to million in additional operating costs associated with new subsidiaries totaled million in after adjusting for these additional expenses  operating costs increased only over overall  operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in income from operations income from operations increased by million to million in these improved earnings resulted from increased sales combined with improved gross profit margins and firm control over operating expenses 
net interest expense net interest expense decreased million to million in this decrease represents the savings realized from the retirement of the company s senior secured notes in september liquidity and capital resources the company has relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under its working capital line  to finance its operations  repay long term indebtedness and fund capital expenditures 
cash provided by operations was million in  million in and million in cash provided by the company s initial public offering in was used to repay million of senior secured notes and related prepayment penalties of million 
cash used for the acquisitions of emerson and kluge was million in and million in  respectively 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures were primarily used for purchasing new machinery and building improvements 
the company expects to increase its level of capital expenditures in the future as it continues to modernize its equipment and renovate its facilities in order to improve its production efficiency 
consistent with industry practice  selmer sells band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
these programs create large working capital requirements during the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately million in august and september  and lows of approximately million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and to facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow selmer to match its production and delivery schedules 
selmer offers the following two forms of financing to qualified band instrument dealers a receivable dating purchases made from january through september have payment due in october 
purchases made from october to december have payment due in january 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing qualified dealers may convert open accounts to a note payable to selmer 
the note program is offered in january and october  and coincides with the receivable dating program 
the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
the majority of notes receivable are purchased by a third party financing company  on a full recourse basis 
the company s current arrangement  which allows the financing company to purchase  at its option  up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million of notes receivable  expires in net notes receivable sales generated approximately million and million in cash in and  respectively 
unlike many of its competitors in the piano industry  steinway does not provide extended financing arrangements to its dealers 
to facilitate long term financing required by some dealers  steinway has arranged for financing through a third party provider which generally involves no guarantee by steinway 
the company s domestic  seasonal borrowing requirements are accommodated through a committed  revolving credit facility with a domestic bank the credit facility 
the credit facility provides the company with a potential borrowing capacity of up to million  based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings are secured by a first lien on the company s domestic inventory  receivables  and fixed assets 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding  and availability was approximately million 
the credit facility currently bears interest at the eurodollar rate plus and expires march  open account loans with foreign banks also provide for borrowings by steinway s foreign subsidiaries of up to million deutsche marks 
at december   the company s total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior subordinated notes and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
cash interest paid was million and million in and  respectively 
all of the company s debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on the company  including its ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities  and to pay cash dividends 
the company s share repurchase program authorizes management to make discretionary repurchases of its ordinary common stock up to a limit of million 
repurchased shares are being held as treasury shares to be used for corporate purposes 
the company repurchased  shares at a cost of million in and  shares at a cost of million in management believes that cash on hand  together with cash flow anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility  will be adequate to meet debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy working capital and general corporate needs through the next twelve months 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
computer programs and hardware that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company s products  which are finely crafted instruments  do not contain software programs and therefore their functionality will not be affected by this issue 
however  it could cause some disruptions of internal operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
the company has focused its year review in the following areas information technology it systems such as hardware and software  non it systems such as manufacturing  distribution and facility equipment containing embedded microprocessors  and the readiness of third parties such as suppliers and customers 
an inventory of all it and non it systems has been taken and efforts are underway to insure that the appropriate testing and remediation or replacement occurs 
virtually all of the company s critical manufacturing and accounting information systems have been tested for year compliance 
many of the critical information systems were replaced over the past two years with year compliant programs in the normal course of business 
the company intends to replace or upgrade non compliant it hardware and software systems by the end of the third quarter of preliminary testing of non it systems and equipment indicates that many of these systems rely on time intervals rather than dates in their operation 
the company is contacting the manufacturers of the non it equipment used in production to obtain assurances as to whether the manufacturers systems are year compliant 
testing and remediation of these systems will continue throughout the company has communicated with major suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable if a supplier fails to correct their own year issue 
most suppliers and customers who have replied to our inquiries indicated that they expect to be year compliant on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will address the year issue in a timely manner 
based on its review to date  the company believes the year problem will not pose significant internal operational disruptions 
events beyond the company s reasonable control could adversely affect the company s ability to produce and deliver its products in a timely manner 
these events could include failure of infrastructure systems  including power  heat and water  disruptions in distribution channels  or the inability of suppliers and customers to engage in normal business activities 
in the third quarter of  the company will develop a contingency plan based on the magnitude and probability that operational disruptions may still occur on january  the company currently believes that the risk of disruption will be minimal since its operations are geographically dispersed and rely on a large supplier and customer base 
the company does not expect the costs associated with its year compliance to be material 
internal employees  whose salaries and wages are included in normal operating expenses  have modified many of the company s information technology systems 
less than million has been spent to date and future costs are not anticipated to be material to its financial position or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board released statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes new standards of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
the statement will be effective for the company in fiscal management is currently evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires external and internal indirect costs of developing or obtaining internal use software to be capitalized as a long lived asset and also requires training costs included in the purchase price of computer software and costs associated with research and development to be expensed as incurred 
sop will be effective for the company in fiscal management is currently evaluating the effects of this statement on the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk by holding forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are used as a hedge against intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current exchange rate 
however  any such gains and losses would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
the company s interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on its variable rate credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest at rates which fluctuate with changes in the eurodollar rate 
as of december   a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s interest expense 
to date  the company has not entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on its short term borrowings 
substantially all of the company s long term debt  approximately million at december   is at fixed interest rates 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense associated with its long term debt due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of the company s long term debt  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by approximately million as of december  such fair value changes may affect the company s determination as to whether to retain  replace or retire its long term debt
