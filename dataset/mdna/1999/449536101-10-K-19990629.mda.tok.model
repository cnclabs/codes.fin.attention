item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company has devoted substantially all of its resources to the research and development of its proprietary technologies  primarily the origen technology for clinical diagnostic and life science research products 
historically  the company s sources of revenue consisted primarily of license or research payments pursuant to licensing or collaborative research agreements 
the company has entered into arrangements with corporate collaborators that provide for the development and marketing of certain origen based systems 
these agreements provide fees and royalties payable to the company in exchange for licenses to produce and sell products 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s revenues from license fees and contract research were substantially replaced by royalties based on its licensees product sales 
in the fiscal year ended march   of the company s revenues resulted from product sales  either by igen or its corporate licensees 
going forward  the company expects an increasing amount of its revenues to be derived from sales of its products and royalties from corporate collaborations  however  the company may selectively pursue additional strategic alliances  which could result in additional contract revenues 
results of operations years ended march  and the company had a net loss of million per share on revenues of million for the year ended march  this compares with a net loss of million per share on revenues of million for the corresponding prior year ended march  during fiscal  million of the company s revenue was generated from the sale of products  either directly by igen or from royalties on licensees sales 
this represents a increase from the million of revenue recorded last year from comparable sources 
pursuant to the company s agreement with roche  the agreement  roche launched its elecsys product line in  which is based on igen s origen technology 
the company is involved in litigation with roche arising out of this agreement 
see item  legal proceedings 
one of the disputes in the litigation relates to the computation of royalties to which the company is entitled under the agreement 
the company recorded royalty income from this agreement of million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
product costs were million of product sales for the year ended march  compared to million of product sales for the corresponding prior year 
lower product costs and improved gross margins are attributable to a change in product mix between instruments  services and reagents and the elimination of sales to organon teknika for which the company received no gross margin 
operating costs  excluding product costs  increased to million in the fiscal compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  research and development costs increased million to million from million in fiscal due to higher personnel and development expenses associated with development of the m series high throughput screening system 
there was an increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal over the prior year of million due primarily to professional and legal fees associated with the company s litigation with roche 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for years beginning after june  the company does not believe that adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
interest income  net of other expense  increased  from higher cash balances and the reduction of interest expense associated with the advance royalty agreement with roche  which was repaid during the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the company s issuance of million of notes in march  the company s interest expense will increase in fiscal compared to income loss from continuing operations over the next several years is likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of revenues earned under license and product development agreements  and associated product development expenses 
as of march   the company had net operating loss and general business credit tax carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and general business credit tax carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue service code of  as amended 
years ended march  and the company had a net loss of million 
per share on revenues of million for the year ended march  this compares with a net loss of million 
per share on revenues of million for the corresponding prior year ended march  during fiscal  million of the company s revenue was generated from the sale of products  either directly by igen or from royalties on licensees sales 
this represents a increase from the million of revenue recorded in fiscal from comparable sources 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s license and contract revenue converted to royalty income based on product sales of corporate licensees 
revenue from license fees and contract research were substantially replaced by royalties based on sales 
therefore  while royalty revenue increased during fiscal  revenue from license fees and contract research decreased to million from million in fiscal the company recorded royalty income from the agreement of million and  for the years ended march  and  respectively 
these amounts were offset by a million advance  secured by future royalties  received from roche in january product costs were million of product sales for the year ended march  compared to million of product sales for the corresponding prior year 
lower product costs and improved gross margins are attributable to a change in product mix between instruments  services and reagents and the reduction of sales to organon teknika for which the company received no gross margin 
operating costs  excluding product costs  decreased to million in the fiscal compared to million during fiscal during fiscal  research and development costs decreased million to million from million in fiscal due to expiring external collaborations 
partially offsetting this decrease was an  increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal over the prior year due primarily to professional and legal fees associated with the company s litigation with roche 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest income  net of other expense  decreased  because of lower cash balances through the first nine months of fiscal coupled with accrued interest expense associated with the advanced royalty agreement with roche initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations through the sale of preferred and common stock  aggregating approximately million through march  also  in march  the company completed a million debt financing with john hancock life insurance company 
the seven year  senior secured notes mature in with quarterly interest only payments of  through september in december  principal and interest installments of million will be due quarterly through march collateral for the debt is represented by royalty payments and rights of the company to receive monies due pursuant to the company s license agreement with roche 
plans for the net proceeds from this financing include continuing research and development  as well as working capital needs related to general corporate expenditures  including the sales and marketing efforts related to the launch of the m series high throughput screening system 
in addition  the company has received funds from collaborative research and licensing agreements  and sales of its origen line of products 
as of march   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
working capital was million at march  net cash used for operating activities was million  million  and million during the years ended march   and  respectively 
license and collaboration agreements between the company and its strategic corporate collaborators provided cumulative payments to the company of approximately million through march  additionally  the company received million in august under an advance royalty agreement with eisai 
the company used approximately million   and  of net cash for investing activities substantially related to the acquisition of laboratory equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements during the years ended march    and  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal years  and  the company incurred capital lease obligations of approximately   and  respectively  related to acquisition of laboratory equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
the company believes material commitments for capital expenditures may be required in a variety of areas  such as product development programs 
the company has not  at this time  made commitments for any such capital expenditures or secured additional sources to fund such commitments 
the company has no reason to believe that the existence of the roche litigation is having a material adverse affect on roche s sales pursuant to its agreement with igen or that a negative result for the company in the roche litigation would have a material adverse affect on roche s sales  although there can be no assurance that the litigation or its outcome would not have such an effect 
as it now stands  roche will have the right to continue to market its elecsys products to central hospital laboratories and clinical reference laboratories during the term of the agreement unless and until the company is determined to have the right to terminate the agreement and then determines to terminate the agreement 
if the company elects to terminate the agreement  it would have a material adverse effect on the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company s royalty revenue from license sales unless and until the company entered into a strategic partnership with another company that is able to commercialize diagnostic instruments to hospitals and clinical reference laboratories 
there can be no assurance  if the company decided to terminate the agreement  that the company would be able to enter into such a strategic partnership on terms favorable to the company 
the company does not expect that failure to prevail in the hitachi litigation by itself would have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue or sales  since hitachi would continue to manufacture roche instruments and the company would continue to earn royalties in connection therewith 
there can be no assurance that the company s failure in the hitachi litigation would not have a material adverse effect or the success by the company in the hitachi litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s intellectual property 
success by the company in the hitachi litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s royalty revenues from sales of elecsys products to the extent that roche s sales of elecsys instruments are hindered because it needs to find a new manufacturer for its instruments or make arrangements to have hitachi manufacture the instruments outside of japan 
the company has incurred and expects to incur substantial additional research and development expenses  manufacturing costs and marketing and distribution expenses and costs related to the roche litigation in the future 
it is the company s intention to selectively seek additional collaborative or license agreements with suitable corporate collaborators  although there can be no assurance the company will be able to enter into such agreements or that amounts received under such agreements will reduce substantially the company s funding requirements 
additional equity or debt financing may be required  and there can be no assurance that these funds may be available on favorable terms  if at all 
the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in its diagnostics programs  the magnitude of these programs  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  changes in its existing license and other agreements  the ability of the company to establish development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
year issue the year yk issue results from computer programs and hardware that are unable to distinguish between the year and the year  accordingly  computer systems that have time sensitive calculations may not properly recognize the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations  causing disruptions of the company s operations  including  without limitation  research  manufacturing  distribution  and other business activities 
the yk problem may affect the company s computer hardware  software  systems  devices and applications  and may also affect products manufactured by collaborators using the company s technology 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company has conducted a review of its systems to identify those areas that could be affected by the yk problem and has established a program to address yk issues 
the company is installing a yk compliant enterprise resource planning erp computer system  which will perform substantially all of the central data processing tasks of the company 
the company is installing this system in order to fully integrate its financial systems with its manufacturing and distribution systems and provide for the growth of its business and not as a concern about the yk problem 
the company has completed installation of the financial systems 
while existing manufacturing and distribution systems are yk compliant  the new manufacturing and distribution installations are planned for completion during the fourth calendar quarter of most of the company s other information technology systems  including desktop computers  server computer equipment and installed commercial application software  are relatively new and have been designed with the yk issue in mind 
the company has completed testing of these information technology systems that are material to the company s business 
to the extent that these systems are found not to be yk compliant  the company believes that any material issues can be resolved by installing commercially available upgrades 
in addition to reviewing its systems  the company has also considered the impact of the yk issue on products that it manufactures and on products manufactured by collaborators using the company s technology 
in all material respects  products manufactured by the company are yk compliant 
the company is aware that certain products manufactured by collaborators using the company s technology may utilize calendar dates 
where known  the company has contacted collaborators to ascertain their awareness of the problem and their plans to address the yk issue 
roche has indicated to igen that its elecsys products are currently yk compliant or can be made yk compliant with a currently available software upgrade 
the company has identified critical providers of information  goods and services suppliers in order to assess their yk compliance and has sent questionnaires to such critical suppliers 
although the company cannot control the response time of suppliers to its surveys  the company has assessed survey responses received through may  and confirmed year readiness of selected suppliers 
additional open responses continue to be monitored and the company anticipates to have confirmed year readiness by september  the company does not intend to contact entities that are not critical and cannot guarantee that such entities will be yk compliant 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers are  or will be  yk compliant or that a failure of timely yk compliance on the part of the suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s business operations are also dependent upon the yk readiness of infrastructure suppliers in areas such as utilities  communications  transportation and other services 
the company has been unable to assess the likelihood  length or effects of failures by any of these suppliers and there can be no assurance that such failures will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  material costs in conjunction with its yk remediation plan 
the majority of the costs incurred to date are related to the installation of the erp system 
as described above  the company did not undertake this project to specifically address the yk issue and the installation has not been accelerated or otherwise modified as a result of the yk issue 
at the current time  the company anticipates that its critical information and non information technology systems will be yk compliant in all material respects before january  although the company does not expect  in view of its yk readiness efforts and diversity of its suppliers and customers  the occurrence of yk failures to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company  there can be no assurance of complete yk compliance 
contingency plans for information technology systems generally anticipate use of standard non customized replacement modules in the event of contingencies 
work with major collaborators and vendors to date has indicated a high awareness of the issues and plans to address them 
alternative vendors are available for most major supplies and raw materials 
nonetheless  it is not possible for the company to fully assess the likelihood or magnitude of consequences from vendor or collaborator yk compliance issues 
while there are no indications of major revenue disruptions from actions of such third parties  there can be no assurance at this time as to the future impacts of yk actions or inactions by collaborators or vendors
