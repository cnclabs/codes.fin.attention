inflation and other economic factors inflation affects finishmaster s costs of materials sold  salaries and other related costs of distribution 
to the extent permitted by competition  finishmaster has offset these higher costs of materials through selective price increases 
the company s business may be negatively affected by cyclical economic downturns in the markets in which it operates 
the company s financial performance is also dependent on its ability to acquire businesses and profitably integrate them into its operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity based instruments at december  and a review of the company s other financial instruments and risk exposures indicated the company had exposure to interest rate risk 
based upon the company s outstanding debt at december  and the term for which current interest rates are fixed  a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense for by an estimated million 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s sales and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter due to various factors and the company expects these fluctuations to continue 
among these factors are seasonal buying patterns of the company s customers and the timing of acquisitions 
historically  sales have slowed in the late fall and winter of each year largely due to inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance for the company is generally lower during the december and march quarters compared to the june and september quarters 
in addition  the timing of acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations of operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company takes advantage of periodic special incentive programs available from its suppliers that extend the due date of inventory purchases beyond terms normally available with large volume purchases 
the timing of these programs can contribute to fluctuations in the company s quarterly cash flows 
although the company continues to investigate strategies to smooth the seasonal pattern of its quarterly results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company s net sales  results of operations and cash flows will not continue to display seasonal patterns 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources in thousands working capital    long term debt    cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash used in provided by financing activities   the cash flow amounts for are for the nine months ended december  the company s primary sources of funds over the past three years were from operations and borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company s principal uses of cash were to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and the repayment of outstanding borrowings 
net cash generated from operating activities was million in compared with million in this increase was a result of higher earnings  increased depreciation and amortization expense and a positive change in operating assets and liabilities 
depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of the properties and intangible assets acquired with the autopaints merger  a full year s amortization on the assets acquired in the thompson acquisition and a higher level of capital expenditures in the current year 
the positive change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a higher level of accounts payable and other liabilities at december  net cash used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in this decrease from was attributable to the million purchase of thompson 
investing activities in included million for capital expenditures  partially offset by million of cash acquired through the merger with autopaints 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for  principally for information technology equipment  will approximate million 
net cash used in financing activities  primarily the repayment of debt  was million in  compared with million of cash provided in borrowings to finance the acquisition of thompson were the primary source of cash for investing activities in the prior year 
total capitalization at december  was million  comprised of million of debt and million of equity 
debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased from to between and this improvement was attributable to the increase in equity resulting from the merger with autopaints and current year net income  along with the decrease in debt resulting from repayments 
at december   the company had term credit and revolving credit facilities totaling million  and senior subordinated debt of million 
the company also had a senior subordinated revolving credit facility in the amount of million with its majority shareholder  which was available to fund working capital and acquisition needs 
this facility expires on march  the company was in compliance with the covenants underlying its credit facilities  and had availability under its revolving credit facility of million as of year end 
based on current and projected operating results and giving effect to total indebtedness  the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available from lenders and other creditors will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  debt service and planned capital expenditures 
the company is  however  currently pursuing other financing arrangements 
should the company be successful in obtaining acceptable financing terms  proceeds will be used to retire certain bank term loans  a portion of amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the subordinated debt payable to ldi 
early retirement of indebtedness will result in an extraordinary loss in the amount of the net book value of capitalized debt issuance costs 
at december   unamortized debt issuance costs were approximately million 
year date conversion many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify years 
these programs were designed without consideration for the effects of the upcoming change in the century  and if not corrected  could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year essentially all of the company s information and technology based systems  as well as many non information technology based systems  are potentially affected by the year issue 
technology based systems reside on the company s midrange computer  servers and personal computers in the corporate office as well as in division offices and stores 
specific systems include accounting  financial reporting  inventory tracking and control  budgeting  tax  accounts receivable  accounts payable  purchasing  distribution  word processing and spreadsheet applications 
non information technology based systems include equipment and services containing embedded microprocessors such as alarm systems and voice mail systems 
the company has relationships with numerous third parties  including several paint manufacturers  equipment suppliers  utility companies  insurance companies  banks  and payroll processors  that may be affected by the year issue 
the company s state of readiness remediation plans have been established for all major systems potentially affected by the year issue 
the current status of the plans for information technology based systems are summarized as follows identification of all applications and hardware with potential year issues 
to the best of the company s knowledge  this has been completed 
for each item identified  performance of an assessment to determine an appropriate action plan and timetable for remediation of each item 
the plan may consist of replacement  upgrade or elimination of the application 
this phase has been completed 
implementation of the specific action plan 
action plans have been completed for all known mission critical systems 
testing each application upon completion 
all in house developed systems have been tested and found to be compliant 
vendor supplied software has been upgraded to year compliant versions  and the company has certification of compliance from the software vendors 
placement of the new process into production 
all applications and systems will be in production by the end of the first quarter of the exception to this is the store paint formula systems supplied by paint vendors 
these systems will be upgraded by the end of the third quarter of the company is in the process of identifying all non information technology based systems 
appropriate remediation plans are being developed  implemented and tested when each affected system is identified 
identification should be completed by the end of the first quarter of and remedied by the end of the third quarter 
identification of areas of potential third party risk is nearly complete and  for those areas identified to date  remediation plans are being developed 
identification and assessment should be completed by the end of the second quarter of and implemented by the end of the third quarter of the costs involved the total cost to the company of achieving year compliance is not expected to exceed million and will consist primarily of the utilization of internal resources 
spending to date totals approximately million 
costs relating to internal systems year compliance are included in the information systems budget and are immaterial as a percentage of that budget 
all costs related to achieving year compliance are based on management s best estimates 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
risks and contingency plan the company is in the process of determining the risks it would face in the event certain aspects of its year remediation plan failed 
it is also developing contingency plans for all mission critical processes 
under a worst case scenario  the company s operations would be unable to deliver product due to internal system failures and or the inability of vendors to deliver materials for distribution 
inventory levels of certain key products may be temporarily increased to minimize exposure 
while virtually all internal systems can be replaced with manual systems on a temporary basis  the failure of any mission critical system will have at least a short term negative effect on operations 
the failure of national and worldwide banking information systems or the loss of essential utilities services due to the year issue could result in the inability of many businesses  including the company  to conduct business 
risk assessment should be completed by the end of the first quarter  and contingency plans should be completed in the third quarter of other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and will require all derivatives to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
as the company is not routinely involved in derivative and hedging activities  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on financial condition or results of operations 
the company is required to adopt this statement in the third quarter of forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements pertaining to  among other things  the company s future results of operations  cash flow needs and liquidity  acquisitions  and other aspects of its business 
the company may make similar forward looking statements from time to time 
these statements are based largely on the company s current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include changes in external market factors  changes in the company s business strategy or an inability to execute its strategy due to changes in its industry or the economy generally  difficulties associated with assimilating acquisitions  the emergence of new or growing competitors  seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  governmental regulations  the potential loss of key suppliers  and various other competitive factors 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the future developments described in the forward looking statements contained in this report will in fact occur
