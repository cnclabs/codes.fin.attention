these factors include the following interest rate fluctuations at the present time  borrowings under the company s credit facility bear interest at a floating rate 
the company recognizes that its results from operations may be negatively impacted by future increases in interest rates and substantial additional borrowings to finance property acquisitions 
lease renewals while the company has historically been successful in renewing and reletting space  the company is subject to the risk that certain leases expiring in and beyond may not be renewed  or the terms of renewal may be less favorable to the company than current lease terms 
the company expects to incur costs in making improvements or repairs to its portfolio of properties required by new or renewing tenants and expects to incur expenses associated with brokerage commissions payable in connection with the reletting of space 
inflation most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the costs of such removal or remediation could be substantial 
additionally  the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using such real estate as collateral 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local laws regarding hazardous or toxic substances  and the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any non compliance or other claim in connection with any of its present or former properties

the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company balances its borrowings between fixed and variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes in thousands fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         average interest rate variable rate libor debt    average interest rate variable rate prime debt    average interest rate as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
