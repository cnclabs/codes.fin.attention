a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what management believes to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company constantly attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
the company has responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase its noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include 
utilizing msrs as a source of noninterest income and as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising interest rate environment 
increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of msrs because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans  
increasing the noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to the company s msrs  
increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services  self directed trust services and real estate disposition  
maintaining a wholesale loan origination operation 
wholesale originations provide a form of hedge against the balance of msrs 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments of the underlying loans 
during this same period  however  the volume of loan originations generally increases  
originating and purchasing adjustable rate mortgages and selling newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages in the secondary market  
increasing emphasis on the origination of construction and commercial real estate lending  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans and generally are at adjustable rates  
increasing retail deposits  which are less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other funding sources  
pursuing strategic acquisitions or alliances that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund the company s investing activities  and 
hedging segments of the company s servicing portfolio and selling forward commitments on our loan pipeline 
lending activities 
the major interest earning asset of the company is the loan portfolio 
consequently  a significant part of the company s asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of the company s loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities 
the following table sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio by loan type as of the dates indicated

the terms of these agreements vary with each seller but include provisions which require the seller to repurchase the loans within a defined period of time  or provide at the company s option  the ability  on short notice  to require the seller to repurchase the loans  or in some cases  allow the seller to repurchase the loans 
in all cases  the seller provides contractual recourse to the company in the event of delinquency and or loss 
loans held for investment  which are contractually due in one or more years  are split between fixed and adjustable rates as follows as of december  one to five over five years years total in thousands fixed    adjustable    total loans    nonperforming assets 
as part of asset and liability management  the company monitors nonperforming assets npas on a monthly basis 
npas consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned 
the following table sets forth the company s npas as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual mortgage loans      nonaccrual commercial loans and direct financing leases  nonaccrual consumer loans total nonperforming loans and leases      foreclosed real estate  repossessed automobiles total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming loans and leases to total loans total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of allowance for loan and valuation losses to total non performing loans and leases interest income on nonperforming loans and leases not included in interest income as of december   the company had approximately  of non government accruing loans that were contractually past due days or more 
beginning in  the company began to accrue interest for government sponsored loans such as fha insured and va guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a significant portion of these loans are serviced by a third party who is required to remit monthly interest regardless of whether it is collected 
the higher levels of nonaccrual mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans during and were primarily attributable to purchases by matrix bank of bulk residential loan portfolios in those years 
decreases in the nonaccrual mortgage loans at december   and are attributable to the improvement of the loans that had past delinquency problems and the credit quality of the loan portfolios the company acquired in  and in the past three years  matrix bank acquired loans with fewer delinquency problems and or document deficiencies  which also resulted in a decrease in the nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans 
the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans and direct financing leases in is the result of the company s origination of tax exempt lease financing for charter schools for the purchase of real estate and equipment 
several of the charter schools for which the company has provided financing have encountered enrollment and or state funding problems which has caused them to become delinquent on their lease obligations to the company 
the increase in the nonaccrual consumer loans in is a result of sub prime auto loans that the company repurchased pursuant to limited representations and warranties included in loan sale agreements 
the company had a separate reserve of  included in other liabilities for anticipated losses relating to the repurchased sub prime auto loans at december  included in repossessed assets for is  of automobiles that the company was required to repurchase pursuant to the same limited representations and warranties 
the balance of the loans and automobiles repurchased in and were either disposed of or sold to a third party investor in december the company does not anticipate that it will originate any additional sub prime automobile contracts 
the prior delinquency and anticipated future delinquencies are taken into consideration in the pricing of the loans acquired 
the company generally purchases such loans at discounts and  in some instances  receives recourse or credit enhancement from the seller to further reduce the company s risk of loss associated with the loans nonaccrual status 
at december   million  or  of the nonaccrual loans were loans that were residential loans purchased in bulk loan portfolios and remain classified as held for sale 
total loans held for sale at december   were million  of which million  or  were nonaccrual loans 
however  against the million of total loans held for sale  the company has million of purchase discounts 
the percentage of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to nonaccrual loans varies widely due to the nature of the company s portfolio of mortgage loans  which are collateralized primarily by residential real estate 
the company analyzes the collateral for each nonperforming mortgage loan to determine potential loss exposure 
in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and valuation losses

the company did not assign any of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to direct financing leases in  as the company originated the million of outstanding direct financing leases in the last month of the year and management felt that it was not necessary due to the immaterial amount of leases relative to the total loan portfolio  as well as payments under the direct financing leases were not due until  and as such  the leases could not have been delinquent at december  this increase in the allowance for loan and valuation losses in reflects the growth of the direct financing leases during and the nonaccrual status of a small portion of this portfolio at december  additionally  the increase in the allowance for loan and valuation losses for consumer loans in primarily reflects the company s increase in its loss factor for credit card loans from to during  due to the increased losses experienced in the portfolio 
risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of the company s earnings and ultimate success is partially dependent upon its ability to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of the company s market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its primary asset  msrs  and also related to the net interest income earned on its originated loans that are funded through warehouse lines of credit 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the msrs which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster which reduces future servicing income  while in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
as it relates to matrix financial s lending activities  matrix financial originates residential mortgage loans  which are generally pre sold 
however  between the time that the loan is originated and sold to the ultimate investor  matrix financial earns interest income 
the loans are funded through the use of warehouse credit facilities that are generally priced based on short term interest rates 
therefore  the net interest income that is earned by matrix financial is generally dependent on the spread between long term mortgage rates and short term interest rates 
the company currently does not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  the company is not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the majority of the company s residential loan portfolio is held for sale which requires the company to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of cost or market 
therefore  the company continually monitors the interest rates of its loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee alco or the committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
alco establishes policies that monitor and coordinate the company s sources  uses and pricing of its funds 
the committee is also involved in formulating the company s budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
due to the historical size of matrix bank s loan portfolio and the high degree of purchase and sale activity  alco has relied on the ots interest rate risk exposure report to assist in the overall monitoring of matrix bank s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the information and assumptions used in the ots exposure report as of december   management believes that a basis point shock over a twelve month period  up or down would not significantly affect matrix bank s annualized net interest income 
as matrix bank continues to grow  management anticipates having to use an asset liability software package to monitor and manage matrix bank s interest rate risk on a more timely basis 
the company continues to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this see asset and liability management general for additional discussion on strategies  management focuses on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and has increased its efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  commercial real estate loans and limited consumer lending which reprice or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
in  the company increased its investment in non performing fha and va loans  which are fixed rate loans that have a significantly shorter life than newly originated loans 
the other significant asset that the company invests in is msrs 
the value and cash flows from msrs respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of fixed rate mortgages decrease in turn decreasing net interest income the value of the msrs increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
another significant strategy that the company focuses on in managing interest rate risk is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in msrs  which generate no cost escrow deposits and sterling trust s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs 
in the ordinary course of business  the company makes commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and holds originated loans until delivery to an investor 
inherent in this business are risks associated with changes in interest rates and the resulting change in the market value of the pipeline loans 
the company mitigates this risk through the use of mandatory and nonmandatory forward commitments to sell loans 
as of december   the company had million in pipeline and funded loans offset with mandatory forward commitments of million and nonmandatory forward commitments of million 
the inherent value of the forward commitments is considered in the determination of the lower of cost or market for such loans 
ownership of msrs exposes the company to impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of the company s mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than projected by the company for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the msrs may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  the company hedged a segment of its portfolio beginning in september as of december  and  the company had identified and hedged million and million  respectively  of its mortgage servicing portfolio using a program of exchange traded futures and options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
the following tables represent  in tabular form  contractual balances of the company s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair value of those on balance sheet financial instruments for the periods ended december  and the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash 
the company s assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as interest earning deposits  fhlb stock and certain other deposits  are considered to be long term in nature by the company and are reported in the thereafter column 
the company has made the assumption that the portfolio of loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
the company is very active in the secondary market as it relates to the purchase and sale of mortgage loans 
the total amount of loans sold in and approximated and  respectively  of the total held for sale portfolio at december  and this proves the company s intent to sell the loans classified as held for sale and the one year maturity assumption is supported 
the company also treats the fhlb and revolving borrowings as long term in nature  as the continued availability of these amounts is anticipated indefinitely 
third party servicers service a portion of the company s loan portfolio  as a result  a portion of the information presented is based on the best available information 
for the most part  the carrying amounts of interest earning deposits  fhlb stock  fhlb borrowings and borrowed money approximate those assets and liabilities fair values 
the fair values of the loan portfolios for held for sale and held for investment are based on quoted market prices or outstanding commitments from investors 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in securitization transactions  adjusted for differences in loan characteristics 
the fair values of forward sale commitments are included in the determination of the fair value of loans held for sale 
the fair values of demand deposits are  by definition  equal to the amount payable upon demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of time deposits are based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected periodic maturities on time deposits 
msrs are not included in the tabular presentation  as the investment does not directly affect interest income 
as noted  however  earnings from msrs directly correlate with market risk as it relates to interest rate fluctuations 
the company mitigates this risk through both the type of msrs acquired and hedging of msrs 
the loans underlying the servicing acquired tend to be more seasoned and have lower principal balances 
management believes that the more seasoned  lower balance servicing portfolios carry less prepayment risk than less seasoned  higher balance mortgage servicing  because the cost savings of refinancing a lower balance loan tend to be less than for a higher balance loan with a comparable interest rate 
it is also believed that if a loan has been outstanding for a period of time and has been through several declining interest rate cycles without refinancing  the risk of prepayment in the future is less than a newly originated loan 
although significantly increased in  the prepayment percentages which the company has experienced over the past three years have been lower than experienced in the industry  as a whole 
the prepayment speeds for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively  during a primarily decreasing interest rate environment 
in the table below  prepayment speeds of and were used for residential and non residential loans  respectively  to project expected cash flows relating to loans held for investment and in the table below  prepayment speeds of were used for all loan types

short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company relies heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowings are the fhlb for matrix bank and unaffiliated financial institutions for matrix financial 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the following table sets forth a summary of the short term borrowings of the company during  and and as of the end of each such period average weighted weighted amount amount maximum average average outstanding outstanding outstanding interest interest at during the at any rate during rate at year end year month end the year year end dollars in thousands at or for the year ended december  fhlb borrowings    revolving lines of credit    repurchase agreements  at or for the year ended december  fhlb borrowings    revolving lines of credit    repurchase agreements   at or for the year ended december  fhlb borrowings    revolving lines of credit    repurchase agreements    lease financing    calculations are based on daily averages where available and monthly averages otherwise 
million of the fhlb borrowings outstanding at december   were borrowed under a short option advance soa agreement with the fhlb 
these soa borrowings have a term of ten years  but are callable by the fhlb beginning after a six month or one year lock out period depending on the particular soa borrowing 
after the expiration of the lock out period  the soa borrowings are callable at three month intervals 
if the fhlb exercises its call option on a soa borrowing  the fhlb is required to offer replacement funding to the company at a market rate of interest for the remaining term of the soa borrowing 
the interest rates on the soa borrowings ranged from to at december  and their possible call dates varied from january  to april  additionally  under the terms of the soa agreement  the company is not permitted to prepay or otherwise retire a callable soa borrowing prior to the final maturity date 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of the company to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy disbursement needs  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis

see properties 
on june   the company amended its bank stock loan and increased the credit available under the loan by an additional million 
the amended bank stock loan has two components  an million term loan and a revolving line of credit of million 
as of december   the balance of the term loan and the revolving line of credit were million and million  respectively 
one year from the date of the amendment  the balance of the revolving line of credit will be converted to a term loan 
the additional proceeds from the loan will be used primarily as capital at matrix bank 
the amended bank stock loan requires the company to maintain i total shareholders equity of the greater of million or of actual net worth at the end of the most recent fiscal year  plus of cumulative net income after the end of the most recent fiscal year  plus of all contributions made to stockholders equity after the closing date  and ii total adjusted debt to net worth less than additionally  the amended bank stock loan does not permit matrix bancorp to declare or pay any dividends

until february  the senior subordinated notes bore interest at per annum 
in february  the rate increased to per annum 
the trend of net cash used by the company s operating activities experienced over the reported periods results primarily from the growth that matrix bank has experienced in its residential loan purchasing activity 
the company anticipates the trend of a net use of cash from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
this anticipation results from the expected growth at matrix bank  which management believes will consist primarily of increased activity in the purchasing of loan and mortgage servicing portfolios 
the company anticipates such growth will be funded through retail deposits  brokered deposits  custodial escrow deposits  directed trust deposits  fhlb borrowings  and possibly  new offerings 
matrix bank s primary source of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are retail deposits  trust deposits  custodial escrow balances  brokered deposits  fhlb borrowings  sales of loan portfolios and proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans 
contractual loan payments and deposit inflows and outflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the fhlb as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had overnight borrowings from the fhlb of million 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios and the timing of payments for taxes and insurance 
for a tabular presentation of the company s short term borrowings  see asset and liability management short term borrowings 
matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
matrix bank s retail deposits principally consist of demand deposits and certificates of deposit 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
matrix bank s retail deposits are obtained primarily from areas in which it is located and  therefore  its retail deposits are concentrated primarily in las cruces and sun city 
matrix bank relies principally on customer service  marketing programs and its relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits 
beginning in february  brokered deposits were accepted and have been utilized to support growth at matrix bank 
in pricing deposit rates  management considers profitability  the matching of term lengths with assets  the attractiveness to customers and rates offered by competitors 
matrix bank intends to continue its efforts to attract deposits as a primary source of funds to support its lending and investing activities

matrix bank s future growth is expected to be achieved through deposit growth  brokered deposits  borrowings from the fhlb and custodial deposits from affiliates 
the company anticipates that such growth will require additional capital 
the capital requirements related to the anticipated growth will in part be fulfilled through retention of earnings  potentially increasing the company s bank stock loan and future possible debt or equity offerings

in june  the company purchased acres of land for million in cash for the purpose of developing residential and multi family lots in ft 
lupton  colorado 
the purchase was completed with operating funds of the company and a loan from a third party financial institution of  as part of the acquisition  the company entered into a planned unit development agreement the development agreement with the city of ft

inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services 
the company discloses the estimated fair market value of its financial instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein

year the following disclosure is a year readiness disclosure and a year statement  as defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act  which was enacted by congress and was effective october  similar to many other companies  the company faces the risk of a potentially serious information systems computer problem because many software applications and operational programs written in the past may not properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing a disruption of operations 
the company has established year project teams  both at the company and individual subsidiary levels 
the year project teams and the company s overall year effort are being overseen by the company s year director to ensure that consistent procedures and methodologies are being applied across the subsidiaries in addressing year issues 
the company is subject to year risks not only from its own internal data processing systems and software  but also from third party sources providing data and or services to the company and from certain significant customers 
additionally  the company has a limited amount of other non information systems equipment that relies on date sensitive information 
as such  the company has established and implemented a year plan that includes the careful evaluation of internal data processing systems and software and incorporates the evaluation of third party sources  significant customers and vendors  and non information systems equipment for year risks 
the company s year plan consists of the following five separate phases 
awareness the process of informing all of the company s employees  vendors  and significant customers about the nature and extent of the year problem 

assessment the process of gathering and analyzing information to determine the size and impact of the year problem  the complexity of issues and the level of work and resources necessary to address year issues 

renovation the process of modifying  reengineering  and retiring non compliant information systems  applications  vendors  third party service providers and non information systems based on the information learned during the assessment phase 

validation the process of testing information systems  application  vendors  third party service providers and non information systems for year compliance 
this testing phase includes both newly renovated and compliant items 

implementation the process of implementing all year compliant changed  newly acquired or modified information systems  application  vendors  third party service providers and non information systems 
this phase also includes the updating of backup  contingency and disaster recovery plans 
it is anticipated that the above phases of the year plan will progress concurrently 
additionally  the company does not anticipate that its subsidiaries will progress at the same rate through the five phases of the year plan due to differences in their systems and the varying levels of complexity associated with those systems 
the company s computing environment consists largely of personal computers pcs connected to local area network lan based systems 
the exception to this is an in house digital vax mini computer system used by sterling trust 
this vax system houses the trust accounting system which is written in the cobol language 
due to the substantial number of programming changes required  sterling trust s year focus to date has mainly been on renovating  validating and implementing changes to the trust accounting system 
unlike sterling trust  processing for many matrix bank and matrix financial systems are handled by outside service bureaus 
therefore  these subsidiaries year efforts are more focused on obtaining information on the compliance status of these outside service bureaus and on performing testing procedures to verify their compliance 
matrix bank s efforts to become year compliant are being monitored by the ots 
failure to become year compliant could subject matrix bank to formal supervisory or enforcement actions 
matrix financial plans to participate in the year inter system readiness test sponsored by the mortgage bankers association  which is currently scheduled to begin during march of the year progress of these three subsidiaries as of february  is seen in the following tables sterling trust year progress awareness assessment renovation validation implementation information systems estimated completion date non information systems estimated completion date third parties estimated completion date matrix bank year progress awareness assessment renovation validation implementation information systems estimated completion date non information systems estimated completion date third parties n a estimated completion date matrix financial year progress awareness assessment renovation validation implementation information systems estimated completion date non information systems estimated completion date third parties estimated completion date the remaining companies have more limited exposure risk to the year issue 
for example  they have fewer mission critical systems  vendors  and customers than the subsidiaries discussed above 
these remaining entities have more limited renovation issues than sterling trust  matrix bank and matrix financial and their validation process is substantially underway 
the progress of the remaining companies is seen in the following table 
remaining companies year progress awareness assessment renovation validation implementation information systems estimated completion date non information systems estimated completion date third parties estimated completion date the implementation process is at varying levels of completion across the company 
included in the implementation phase of the company s year plan is the development of a contingency plan for the failure of the company s mission critical systems 
several of the company s subsidiaries have completed their contingency plans and it is anticipated that the remainder of the contingency plans will be finished by june  these plans will address issues such as the failure of the company s third party service providers  the failure of the trust accounting system  the failure of our telecommunications network  and so on 
assuming the proper functioning of the company s telecommunication and utility providers  the failure of which would have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct its day to day operations  management of each subsidiary has assessed what is believed to be the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario if the company were to take no further steps to prevent year non compliance 
sterling trust relies on electronic information received from various external sources such as mutual fund companies  life insurance companies  broker dealers  etc  to prepare quarterly statements and to process the investment directions of clients 
sterling trust s most reasonably likely worst case scenario lies in not being able to obtain this data 
many of sterling trust s external service providers are either regulated by the national association of securities dealers or are owned by one of the stock exchanges 
as such  sterling trust anticipates that most of these companies will be compliant 
if for some reason the data from the outside service providers is available  but cannot be transmitted electronically  sterling trust plans to coordinate the receipt of that information via phone and fax lines 
once received  sterling trust will then manually input the data into their system in order to perform the necessary functions described above 
in addition  the database for sterling trust s imaging system is not currently compliant 
if sterling trust did not take the necessary steps to upgrade this database  there would be no source documents available  however  the information would be on the vax 
as such  sterling trust could either upgrade its sequel server or replace the imaging system entirely 
until one of these alternatives was completed  sterling trust would maintain and file source documents in paper form  as it did prior to the time it began using the imaging system 
management from matrix bank anticipates that its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would be the failure of one of its credit card service providers  such as matrix bank s credit card processor 
in the event that these service providers are not year compliant  matrix bank anticipates discontinuing their credit card programs  which are mainly provided as a service to the bank s customers  but do not contribute significantly to the net income of the company on a consolidated basis 
alltel  fnma and fhlmc  whom matrix financial and matrix bank rely on for servicing mortgage loans are currently running compliant systems  however  the company has not yet validated those systems 
the company anticipates using phone and fax lines to receive necessary information if systems for alltel  fnma or fhlmc fail on january  under matrix financial s most reasonably likely worst case year scenario  two other areas may be affected 
the first is the production department where loan documentation is received from outside brokers and processed by matrix financial 
these loan documents could contain inaccurate calculations resulting from a year problem with the software hardware used by the broker to generate the documents 
matrix financial risks inputting these loans into their pc based in house loan processing system  resulting in the bad input information being carried forward in the system 
since there are more than brokers that send these documents to matrix financial  it is unlikely that matrix financial will be able to certify that all of the brokers are year compliant 
as such  additional legal disclosures are being reviewed to protect matrix financial in the event of such a problem 
additionally  due to the large number of brokers  matrix financial intends to cease the acceptance of loan documents from those brokers that are identified as non compliant 
the loss of business from any one broker will not have a material impact on the company  as no broker is individually significant to the company s operations 
in addition  matrix financial is currently running a non compliant version of mortgageware  which is the application that allows matrix financial to process new loan applications 
matrix financial intends to upgrade this application to a compliant version before june   however  if the upgrade does not occur  matrix financial would manually register and lock loan applications with the secondary marketing department and would track the new applications in an excel or access spreadsheet 
additionally  up front disclosures and processing would either be completed through different origination software or outsourced to a thrid party and closing documents would be generated from shadownet  which is already compliant or would be outsourced to a year compliant vendor 
the second area of exposure for matrix financial is the secondary marketing department 
each day  rate information is received and loans are locked in at a set rate to be sold to investors 
if an investor is unable to verify and process the loan rate lock confirmation the paper copy of the agreed upon transaction due to a year issue  then matrix financial may be forced to relock the loans at the current day s rates  unless other evidence of the transaction exists 
due to the daily fluctuation in these rates  this could expose matrix financial to significant interest rate risk on the affected loans 
this process is being reviewed to provide an alternative method between matrix financial and the investors for confirmation of the loan rate information 
for the remaining companies  the worst case scenarios involve the following issues for matrix bancorp  united financial and united capital markets  validation of compliant year systems and applications is not complete 
therefore  it is possible that systems and applications which have been represented to the company as compliant by vendors may not work 
if the validation phase is not completed on these items  the company will have no assurance of these systems and applications compliance  and as such  may have inoperable programs  which could significantly affect aspects of the company s business 
uss s database used for tracking its properties under management has also not yet been tested to determine whether further renovation issues exist 
if this process is not completed  it will be uncertain as to whether uss would be able to continue to accurately track its properties under management  which could significantly affect its business 
the company anticipates that the total costs associated with implementing its year plan will not exceed  as such  year compliance is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
most of the costs associated with the year issue will be expensed as incurred  however  any costs attributable to the purchase of new software will be capitalized 
through february   the company had expensed approximately  for costs associated with year compliance 
the costs of the year project and the deadlines by which the company believes that it will progress through the various phases of the project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
management presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if the required modifications or replacements are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
additionally  despite the company s efforts to verify the year compliance of third parties  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted timely and will not have an adverse effect on the company or its systems
