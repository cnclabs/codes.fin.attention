year disclosure the year issue concerns the inability of information systems  primarily computer software programs  to recognize properly and process date sensitive information subsequent to december  the company has committed resources approximately  over the past six months to improve its information systems is project 
the company has used this is project as an opportunity to evaluate its state of readiness  estimate expected costs and identify and quantify risks associated with any potential year issues 
state of readiness in evaluating the company s exposure to the year issue  management first identified those systems that were critical to the ongoing business of the company and that would require significant manual intervention should those systems be unable to process dates correctly following december  these systems were the company s internal time tracking system and internal administrative system 
once these systems were identified  the following steps were identified as those that would be required to be taken to ascertain the company s state of readiness i 
obtaining letters from software and hardware vendors concerning the ability of their products to properly process dates after december   ii 
testing the operating systems of all hardware used in the company  and internal administration systems to determine if dates after december  can be processed correctly  iii 
surveying other parties who provide or process information in electronic format to the company as to their state of readiness and ability to process dates after december   and iv 
testing the identified information systems to confirm that they will properly recognize and process dates after december  the company anticipates completion of step i step iv above for all material software and hardware by the end of june any software or hardware determined to be noncompliant will be modified  repaired or replaced 
the company estimates the costs of such modifications  repairs and replacements to be  at this time 
costs as noted above  the company spent approximately  over the past six months to improve its information systems 
in addition  the company anticipates that it will spend approximately  over the next months to further improve its information systems 
risks effective august   the securities and exchange commission issued release no 
the release in an effort to provide further guidance to reporting companies concerning disclosure of the year issue 
in this release  the commission required that registrants include in its year disclosure a reasonable description of its most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
based on the company s assessment and the results of remediation performed to date as described above  the company believes that all problems related to the year will be addressed on a timely basis so that the company will experience little or no disruption in its business immediately following december  however  if unforeseen difficulties arise  or if compliance testing is delayed or necessary remediation efforts are not accomplished in accordance with the company s plans described above  the company anticipates that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario as required to be described by the release is that some percentage of the company s time tracking related to contract labor costs would need to be processed manually for some limited period of time 
in addition  the company anticipates that all businesses regardless of their state of readiness  including the company  will encounter some minimal level of disruption in its business eg  phone and fax systems  alarm systems  etc 
as a result of the year issue 
however  the company does not believe that it will incur any material expenses or suffer any significant loss of revenues in connection with such minimal disruptions 
contingency plans as discussed above  in the event of the occurrence of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario the company could hire an appropriate level of temporary staff to manually assist with the time tracking process 
forward looking statements certain information set forth above regarding the year issue and the company s plans to address those problems are forward looking statements under the securities act and the exchange act 
see the second paragraph of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of forward looking statements and related risks and uncertainties 
in addition  certain factors particular to the year issue could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements  including  without limitation failure to identify critical information systems which experience failures  delays and errors in the compliance and remediation efforts described above  unexpected failures by key vendors  software providers or business partners to be year compliant or the inability to repair critical information systems 
in any such event  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  the failure to be year compliant of third parties outside of our control such as electric utilities or financial institutions could adversely effect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated  information derived from the company s financial statements expressed as a percentage of the company s contract revenue earned year ended december  contract revenue earned cost of revenue earned gross profit selling and administrative expenses research and development expense restructuring income before income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue earned decreased  or  from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  primarily due to the completion of the idaho child support enforcement project in march  and the substantial completion of the rhode island department of health system kidsnet and the maine automated child welfare information system macwis projects 
this decrease was offset by increased work on the rhode island department of human services contract due to welfare reform  commencement of the mim corporation project  and increased business for the company s network services division 
cost of revenue earned  consisting of direct employee labor  direct contract expense and subcontracting expense  decreased  or  from  in to  in this was primarily due to a lower reliance on subcontractor labor  which is generally at a higher cost than the company s internal staff 
gross profit increased  from  in to  in gross profit  as a percentage of revenue was for and for this was primarily because of the company s improved margins on the maine macwis support project over the maine macwis project 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in to  in primarily due to an increase in marketing and related expenses 
on a percentage basis  sg a expenses increased from in to in  as a percentage of contract revenue earned 
interest expense decreased  or from  in to  in due to a lower level of borrowing 
as a result of the foregoing  income before income taxes was  in  an increase of  from  in income before income taxes  as a percentage of contract revenue earned increased from in to in net income of  in represents an increase of  or  from  in as a percentage of contract revenue earned  net income increased from in to in the company s effective tax rate was for and for year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue earned increased  or  from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  primarily due to the commencement of the maine automated child welfare information system macwis and additional work on the rhode island support contract in response to federal welfare reform legislation 
this increase was offset in part by the substantial completion of the idaho and the virgin islands child support enforcement cse projects and the west virginia support project 
cost of revenue earned  consisting of direct employee labor  direct contract expense and subcontracting expense  increased  or  from  in to  in this was a consequence of an increased level of effort needed to support the higher level of business 
gross profit increased  from a loss of  in to  in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was for and for the company s expected lower margin on the maine macwis project  where the company s subcontractor is playing a significant role  was offset by higher margins on the welfare reform work on the rhode island support project

on a percentage basis  sg a expenses decreased from in to in  as a percentage of contract revenue earned  primarily as a consequence of the company s efforts to reduce expenses and increase revenues

the company expects to continue and expand this practice prospectively as well as to pursue more time and material contracts than it has historically pursued 
time and materials contracts generally do not require performance bonds and almost always involve less risk to deliver what the customer requires 
the company has historically not received its first contract progress payments until approximately three to six months after contract award  which itself was as much as months after proposal preparation commences 
the company was therefore required to fund substantial costs well before the receipt of related income  including marketing and proposal costs and the cost of a performance bond 
prospectively  the company expects to tighten up this timetable  thereby reducing the requirement for additional working capital 
the company has funded its operations through cash flows from operations  bank borrowings  borrowings from venture partners  and private placements of equity securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was   and  in the years ended december    and respectively 
fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily the result of changes in net income  accounts receivable and income tax receivable  accounts payable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts due to differences in contract milestones and payment dates 
on april  the company signed a term loan the loan with its bank which required the company to reduce its outstanding borrowings under the loan from million to the following limits october   november   and december   the interest rate on the loan was  with the difference between and prime plus payable at maturity  which was january  there were also a number of provisions for accelerated payment to reduce the loan balance  such as paying the bank of any contract holdbacks or income tax refunds 
in addition  the company agreed to provide the bank with warrants to purchase  unregistered shares of the company s common stock at per share  exercisable immediately with an expiration date of april   and agreed to provide the bank of any recovery received from its litigation in hawaii 
the warrants and the bank s right to a percentage of any recovery would terminate if the company paid down the loan completely or raised million of equity capital prior to maturity 
the company s obligations under the loan were secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the loan also provided that the company not pay any dividends on its capital stock without the consent of the bank 
on january  the loan was paid in full 
as of december   the balance was  the warrants and the bank s right to a percentage of any hawaii recovery were returned to the company 
on december  the company signed a million line of credit with a commercial lender the line of credit 
accounts receivable from four of the company s contracts secure the new line of credit 
the company can borrow up to of the aggregate invoice amounts and is required to repay any borrowings within days 
the interest rate is prime plus five percent on balances below million and prime plus one and one half percent on balances over million 
the line of credit also carries a six percent annual service fee on borrowed balances 
at december  the line of credit had an outstanding balance of zero 
on september  the company entered into two five year term loans  each for  one lender was the small business loan fund corporation  sblfc  a subsidiary of the rhode island economic development corporation 
the other lender was the business development corporation of rhode island bdc 
the sblfc loan carries an annual interest rate of and must be repaid over five years 
the bdc loan carries an annual interest rate of  and an annual deferred fee of  and must be paid back over five years 
both term loans are secured by substantially all the assets of the company 
the bdc was also issued five year warrants to purchase  unregistered shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire on september  the fair value of the warrants was estimated by the company to be  using the black scholes model and is being amortized ratably over the exercise period 
such amount is included in other noncurrent assets on the accompanying balance sheet 
the company believes that cash flow generated by operations will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through the end of this assumes  however  that there are no materially adverse decisions rendered in the ongoing litigation with hawaii  maximus and cbsi 
see item legal proceedings 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations to date 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 reporting comprehensive income which established standards for reporting and displaying of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
this statement requires that an enterprise classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and had no effect on the company s financial statements for and in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information was issued 
this statement requires the use of the management approach model for segment reporting 
the management approach model is founded upon the way the company s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
reportable segments are based on products and services  geography  management structure  or other parameters which management uses to organize a company 
the company is required to adopt this new standard for the year ended december   however  such standard had no effect on the company s financial statements for and in february  statement of financial accounting standards no   employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits was issued 
this statement standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits  requires additional information on changes in the benefit calculation  and eliminates certain disclosures that are no longer considered useful 
this statement effectively revised guidance previously provided by statement of financial accounting standards nos   and the company is required to adopt the new standard for the year ended december   however  such standard had no effect on the company s financial statements for in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as both assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this standard is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  factors that may affect future results labor considerations due to the technical and labor intensive nature of the company s business  continued success of the company depends largely upon the ability of management to attract and retain highly skilled information technology professionals and project managers possessing the technical skills and experience necessary to deliver the company s services 
there is a high demand for qualified information technology professionals worldwide and they are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
the company has no assurance that qualified information technology professionals will continue to be available in sufficient numbers  or at wages  which will enable the company to retain current or future employees 
a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition would be expected if the company fails to attract or retain qualified information technology professionals in sufficient numbers 
technological considerations rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changing client preferences and new product introductions characterizes the information technology industry 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to develop technological solutions that keep pace with changes in the industry 
there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s services noncompetitive or obsolete or that the company will be able to keep pace with the expected continued rapid changes in technology 
a failure by the company to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
year client considerations the company s contracts  including year projects  often involve projects that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to measure 
there can be no assurance that despite the company s attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from errors  mistakes  omissions or negligent acts in rendering its services  these attempts will be successful 
the company s inability to meet a client s expectations in the delivery of its services could result in a material adverse effect to the client s operations and  therefore  could potentially give rise to claims against the company or damage the company s reputation  detrimentally affecting its business  operating results and financial condition 
long term contract concerns the typical contract with a client is for a term of one to three years 
generally  there is no assurance that a client will renew its contract when it terminates 
under such contracts  clients may reduce the use of the company s services without penalty 
failure by the company to retain its existing clients could materially adversely effect its results of operations
