in fiscal  compared to 
in fiscal  and 
in fiscal results of operations total revenue increased percent to  for fiscal  an increase of  from last year  and a  decrease when compared to two years ago 
the decrease is due to the closing of fifteen unprofitable big boy restaurants at the end of fiscal  during which they contributed  to sales 
same store sales in big boy restaurants improved more than four percent during fiscal year  continuing the strong gains that began in the second half of fiscal  when new radio and television commercials began airing 
production of the new commercials  featuring customers favorite things distinct signature items like the super big boy sandwich  hot fudge cake and freshly made onion rings  were the result of extensive consumer research designed to influence strategic marketing direction that strengthens the company s position in the ever changing marketplace 
to continue to fuel same store sales and competitive differentiation  the company has undertaken a process to review the entire dining experience to better accommodate shifts in customer expectations 
consumer research is being channeled to leverage the strengths of the existing concept to develop the next generation of frisch s big boy 
the new architecture  which will further signal to the customer that something new and exciting has taken place in the dining room  will be used to build future big boy restaurants 
for the past two years  the sales gains have been especially strong from carryout and drive thru trade  which have been driven by a marketing emphasis on combo meals 
no big boy restaurants were opened or closed during fiscal  as management s focus continued on building same store sales and margins in the existing big boy restaurants operated by the company 
menu prices were increased approximately percent and percent  respectively  in the second and third quarters of fiscal  percent in the first and third quarters of fiscal  and additional increases of percent were implemented in the first and third quarters of fiscal another menu price increase is currently being planned for autumn average annual sales volume of a big boy restaurant in operation for the entire fiscal year increased to  from  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company believes sales gains in fiscal have also resulted from lower employee turnover  as more experienced employees provide certain operating efficiencies and better responsiveness to customer needs  generating repeat business 
the improvement in turnover is attributed to restaurant management use of the company s innovative software products the star employee selection program  the grow interactive employee training system  and crews  a telephone processed program that provides information to restaurant managers on employee job satisfaction 
a significant turnover reduction was also achieved in the ranks of restaurant managers  largely due to the new variable compensation program  more fully described in the payroll and related expenses discussion appearing below 
the company s first golden corral restaurant opened january   contributing in excess of  in sales in the eighteen week period that it operated during fiscal  greatly exceeding initial expectations 
the company plans to build more golden corrals and expects average annual sales volumes of  sales for the two hotels operated by the company were flat in fiscal compared to fiscal  after reporting a sales decline in fiscal compared to fiscal other revenue increased over fiscal principally due to a final partnership distribution from the cincinnati reds professional baseball team that was received during the third quarter of fiscal other revenue was less than two years ago  however  due to lower fees earned from big boy licensees 
at the end of fiscal  there were licensed big boy restaurants in operation  including three that opened during fiscal in restaurant facilities formerly operated by the company in the indianapolis area  compared with such restaurants at the beginning of the three year period 
cost of sales increased  or percent during fiscal however  as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales fell to percent from percent last year 
cost of sales were percent of revenue in fiscal the decreasing trend reflects an overall improvement in restaurant margins that primarily resulted from sales increases 
also  closing the fifteen unprofitable restaurants greatly aided the fiscal improvement from fiscal an analysis of the components of cost of sales follows 
lower food and paper costs were once again achieved in fiscal  falling to percent of revenue from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal lower pork and beef prices aided the improvement 
in addition  carryout and drive thru meals  which have been fueling the sales increases  usually have lower food cost than typical dining room meals 
the economies of scale afforded by an efficient commissary operation and effective menu management also helped to reduce food costs 
payroll and related expenses continued to rise during fiscal  driven by higher hourly pay rates  the direct result of continuing tight labor conditions in all of the company s markets 
favorable claims experience in the company s self insurance programs resulted in significant credits to payroll and related expenses in all three fiscal years 
without these adjustments  payroll and related expenses would have been percent  percent and percent of revenue  respectively  in fiscal years  and the percentage reduction in fiscal from fiscal reflected the elimination of higher than average payroll costs in the indianapolis area where ten of the fifteen closed restaurants had operated 
additionally  payroll and related expenses continue to benefit greatly from the permanent structural cost reduction associated with the company s withdrawal from the ohio workers compensation system at the beginning of fiscal a new variable compensation program for restaurant managers was instituted at the beginning of fiscal it allows restaurant managers to earn variable compensation based on cash flows generated at their restaurant 
as had been expected  the program has resulted in higher management payroll costs 
however  these higher payroll costs have been largely offset by the elimination of service trainer management positions  a percent reduction in field supervisors  and lower management turnover 
there is increasing speculation that the federal minimum wage might be increased by as much as an hour as early as the year based on current labor conditions  such an increase would not have an immediate material effect on the company s payroll costs 
however  the long term effects of such legislation would likely create additional pressure on profit margins  especially if provisions are included in the legislation for automatic increases each year that would rise in proportion to increases in the consumer price index 
other operating expenses decreased to percent of revenue during fiscal from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the percentage improvement is largely due to the sales increase  as these expenses tend to be more fixed in nature 
the elimination of fixed costs in the fifteen low volume closed restaurants also aided the fiscal improvement 
fiscal included a charge of  to write off future occupancy costs of certain leased property 
opening costs approximating  for the company s first golden corral restaurant and  for future golden corrals were expensed as incurred as other operating expense in fiscal  reflecting the company s early adoption of new accounting rules 
the charges for opening costs resulted in golden corral having a negative impact on the company s earnings during fiscal total cost of sales also increased in fiscal and fiscal due to higher depreciation charges for the hotels 
combined with hotel revenue below expectations  these higher charges resulted in operating losses in the hotel division in fiscal years and  after having enjoyed many years of hotel operating profits 
shortly after fiscal  the company announced that it has reached an agreement with choice hotels international to re flag the quality hotel riverview in covington  kentucky to the upscale clarion brand 
extensive renovations over the last few years qualified the riverview property for a more upscale market and should allow the hotel to charge premium rates for its rooms  resulting in a much higher return on invested capital 
administrative and advertising expense in fiscal increased  or percent over fiscal  and percent higher than fiscal the fiscal increase over fiscal is principally due to gains recorded in fiscal from the disposition of six properties unrelated to fifteen big boy restaurants that were closed at the end of fiscal also  fiscal s administrative and advertising expense includes higher charges than fiscal for advertising costs  roll out costs for point of sale systems in big boy restaurants  and franchise advisory charges 
fiscal included the cost of the strategic planning committee s initiatives with respect to the stock repurchase plan  a proxy contest and a charge to lower the carrying cost of certain property held for sale  all of which were largely offset by an  gain on the sale of the big boy farm property 
results for all three fiscal years were adversely affected by charges for the impairment of long lived assets 
charges of   and  respectively  were taken in fiscal years  and  in connection with the closing of fifteen unprofitable restaurants at the end of fiscal these restaurants sustained pre tax losses of approximately  in fiscal eight of these former big boy restaurants had been disposed of through the first half of fiscal  generally at prices above original estimates 
however  during the second quarter of fiscal  it became apparent that the remaining seven restaurants would ultimately have to be disposed of for values significantly below the initial estimates that were used when the restaurants closed 
contracts were accepted at prices lower than originally estimated on four of the properties during the second quarter  and the company lowered expectations for the remaining three 
three of the four accepted contracts were with a big boy franchise operator  a minority shareholder of which is an officer of the company 
the terms of these transactions were no less favorable than would have been agreed upon with persons having no relationship with the company 
all of the four contracts accepted during the second quarter were consummated by may  of the three remaining properties  two are currently under contract with the same big boy franchise operator discussed above 
interest expense in fiscal decreased  or percent lower than the comparable period a year ago  but was percent higher than fiscal interest attributable to the tender offer loan see notes c and f to the consolidated financial statements was  in fiscal  compared with  last year and zero in fiscal interest associated with other borrowings and capitalized leases declined  in fiscal compared to fiscal  and was  lower than fiscal  due to a combination of lower interest rates  scheduled debt reduction and the timing of borrowing and repayment of revolving debt 
interest on the tender offer loan will continue to spiral downward in fiscal  during which the loan is expected to be retired 
the outstanding principal balance of the tender offer loan was  as of may   a reduction of  in the last twelve months  and a reduction of  since the debt was incurred in august savings from the reduction in tender offer interest will likely be tempered by borrowing needed to construct golden corral restaurants during the next three fiscal years 
provision for income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal  compared with percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the increased tax rate in fiscal reflects higher state income taxes associated with the extraordinary gain from the sale of the company s limited partner interest in the cincinnati reds 
also  improved operating profits in fiscal and caused total federal tax credits to be a lower percentage of pre tax earnings  adding to the higher effective tax rates when compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was  an increase of  over last year and  higher than two years ago 
these funds were generated principally from net income and depreciation  and were utilized for discretionary capital improvements  dividends  and to service debt 
investing activities in fiscal included  in capital costs  an increase of  from the prior year and  higher than fiscal fiscal s capital spending included  for golden corral  which includes all costs of the first restaurant now in operation  along with land and construction costs to date for the next two golden corrals scheduled to open later in the summer of this year s capital costs also consisted of  to complete installation of the new point of sale systems in big boy restaurants   to remodel big boy restaurants   to renovate the hotel properties  and  in routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
proceeds from property sales were  substantially all of which came from the disposal of six of the fifteen restaurants closed at the end of fiscal the company expects to complete the disposal of the remaining three closed restaurants within the next nine to twelve months

financing activities in fiscal included  of new debt borrowed against the company s revolving line of credit and  borrowed against the company s golden corral credit facility 
scheduled long term debt payments of  were made and  was paid against the tender offer loan principally with proceeds from the sale of six of the fifteen closed restaurants 
on september   the company used the after tax proceeds from the sale of its interest in the cincinnati reds to repay  against the tender offer loan 
the company also used  from the reds sale proceeds to pay down its revolving line of credit 
regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders totaling  were also paid in fiscal on october   the board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock on the open market 
through may   the company repurchased  shares at a cost of  the company expects funds from operations to be sufficient to cover near term capital spending on big boy and hotel facilities  scheduled debt service unrelated to the tender offer loan and regular quarterly cash dividends 
if needed  the company s revolving credit loan is available to meet additional borrowing requirements 
the company currently plans to build four new big boy restaurants in calendar year  one of which will replace an older existing restaurant 
these new restaurants will introduce the new building design discussed earlier 
costs to remodel big boy restaurants scheduled in fiscal are expected to be approximately  capital spending on the hotel properties should approximate  in fiscal the terms of a development agreement with golden corral franchising systems  inc call for the company to open golden corral restaurants through the company plans to have five restaurants opened and in operation by february one of the five has already opened and two are currently under construction 
in addition  current plans call for four more golden corrals to open in calendar year costs are being funded through cash flow and a new credit facility under which the company may borrow up to  through september  the cost to build and equip each golden corral restaurant is expected to average  including land

modifications have been completed to all of the required date fields for the company s custom written headquarters software 
testing of the modified software is underway and should be completed by august the company has utilized internal resources to convert and test these systems without material incremental cost

the plan calls for these systems to be compliant in october certain other systems that have embedded chip technology are not expected to pose a significant effect on the company s operations 
surveys have been sent to the company s critical suppliers and service providers to determine their readiness for the year issue 
the company will develop contingency plans by september for any third parties the company believes will have material year problems 
although the company has not been informed by any third parties of material year problems  there is no absolute assurance that any of these entities will in fact be compliant on january  the company is unable to estimate the effect that multiple third parties non compliance may have on food and other product delivery 
however  management believes the risk is minimal as product is generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers
