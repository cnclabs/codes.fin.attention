the newly acquired company has been renamed nichols aluminum alabama  inc nichols aluminum alabama in alignment with quanex s other aluminum mill sheet businesses in its nichols aluminum division 
nichols aluminum alabama s operations include cold rolling aluminum sheet to specific gauge  annealing  leveling  custom painting and slitting to width 
nichols aluminum alabama employs approximately people 
business segments the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas for the fiscal year ended sfas requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
pursuant to sfas  the company has three reportable segments engineered steel bars  aluminum mill sheet products  and engineered products 
the company s previously reported aluminum products group has been split into two segments aluminum mill sheet products and engineered products 
the engineered steel bar segment consists of engineered steel bars manufacturing  steel bar and tube heat treating services and steel bar and tube wear and corrosion resistant finishing services 
the aluminum mill sheet segment manufactures mill finished and coated aluminum sheet 
the engineered products segment manufactures impact extruded aluminum and steel parts  aluminum window and patio door screens  window frames and other roll formed products and stamped shapes 
the following table sets forth selected operating data for the company s three business segments years ended october  in thousands engineered steel bars net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    aluminum mill sheet products net sales    operating income    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    engineered products  net sales    operating income loss    depreciation and amortization    identifiable assets    includes nitrosteel and heat treat divisions previously reported under the steel tubes segment 
see note to financial statements results include three weeks of nichols aluminum alabama s operations acquired october  see note to financial statements results include three months of piper impact s operations 
also  data includes the results of piper impact europe 
identifiable assets as of october  and include assets of piper impact europe  acquired october  see note to financial statements during  piper impact recorded a million non recurring restructuring charge as the result of impairment as described by statement of financial accounting no 
this restructuring charge is included in operating income 
see note to financial statements the engineered steel bar business posted another record year  driven by strong demand in the transportation markets 
the business achieved best ever levels in sales and operating income 
in december  steel scrap prices reached their lowest levels in years  but this has been offset by some softening in the marketplace for steel bar products as customers work to manage their inventories 
in fiscal  macsteel plans to finish its phase iv expansion project which will double its production capacity for macplus  its most premium product 
work has begun on phase v  which will increase capacity at macsteel s engineered bar mills and the macsteel heat treating division and will improve operational efficiency at macsteel nitrosteel 
the aluminum mill sheet business ended the year on a high note 
spreads have increased from their depressed levels in the first half of the year and aluminum scrap prices are relatively stable 
the backlog for the first quarter is stronger than normal  helped in part by the acquisition of nichols aluminum alabama 
the business also has finished construction of its rotary furnace project at its mini mill in davenport  iowa  which will allow the casting plant to use less costly  lower grade scrap in its production process 
the furnaces are expected to become fully operational in early fiscal the engineered products business had a tough year 
the automotive air bag market underwent major and rapid changes during fiscal while piper impact europe made a solid contribution in its first full year with the company  slack demand in asia and the general motors strike adversely affected sales for piper impact s products in north american markets 
to improve its competitiveness and its cost structure  piper impact is consolidating its operations in new albany  mississippi by closing down a finishing plant in park city  utah 
marketing efforts remain focused on building sales in diversified applications using piper impact s unique product design capabilities and impact extrusion manufacturing process 
the fabricated products businesses  amsco and homeshield fabricated products had slightly better results for fiscal as these businesses further improved their operations 
efforts remain focused on using existing capacity for new products and for developing end markets using the company s unique value added roll forming and polylaminate technology 
outlook the company currently expects that overall business levels for fiscal should be similar to those experienced during however  domestic and global market factors will impact the company and any slowdown in the us economy could affect demand and pricing for many of the company s products 
since the non recurring restructuring charge at piper impact included the write off of goodwill and some long lived assets  it will result in lower depreciation and amortization for fiscal the acquisition of nichols aluminum alabama is expected to impact earnings in fiscal improved financial results will be dependent upon  among other things  whether the continued strength of the economy can be sustained  improvements in the markets which the company serves  and whether the improvements in the price spreads of aluminum mill sheet products can be sustained 
compared to net sales net sales for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million when compared to fiscal this increase reflects higher net sales in all three business segments as well as an increase of million resulting from sales to discontinued operations which were previously reflected as intersegment sales and eliminated in these sales are now third party sales and are not eliminated in piper impact europe  which was acquired in october  contributed a full year of sales in fiscal net sales for fiscal from the company s engineered steel bar business were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a better mix of product sales with a higher percentage of macplus and bearing steels 
net sales from the company s aluminum mill sheets products business for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to strong demand  which yielded a increase in volume 
net sales from the engineered products group increased million to million 
the majority of the increase resulted from the addition of piper impact europe offset by a decrease in net sales at piper impact 
restructuring charge during the year ended october   the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to its subsidiary  piper impact 
components of this special charge include million for goodwill impairment  million for impairment of property  plant and equipment  and thousand for severance benefits to be paid to employees of the park city  utah plant 
piper impact experienced significant changes in market conditions and the relationship with its major customer in fiscal  which led to substantial declines in sales and operating cash flow 
management began an evaluation of the operations of piper impact in august as a result of this evaluation  in september  management approved a plan to close the park city  utah facility and move its production to the new albany  mississippi facility 
due to the significance of the changes discussed above and the decision to close one of the acquired production facilities  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of all of the assets of piper impact  excluding the new steel plant  as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
management concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant impairment of intangible as well as long lived assets had occurred 
an impairment charge was required because estimated fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from management s estimates 
the one time restructuring charge resulted in an after tax impact on net income of million or per share 
operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million 
included in operating income was the one time million restructuring charge discussed above 
operating income excluding this restructuring charge was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal primary contributing factors to this increase were increased sales and operating income from the engineered steel bar and aluminum mill sheet business and the inclusion of a full year of piper impact europe in the engineered products business 
these improvements were partly offset by lower operating income from piper impact of the engineered products business 
operating income from the company s engineered steel bar business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was principally due to increased sales from strong demand in the transportation markets as well as lower material prices 
these results represented a record year for this business 
operating income from the company s aluminum mill sheet products business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was principally due to increased volume and net sales accompanied by lower scrap prices 
during the fourth quarter of  this business experienced a turnaround with strong demand and favorable material costs 
the company s engineered products business experienced an operating loss of million for fiscal included in this loss was the non recurring restructuring charge of million described above 
operating income for excluding this restructuring charge was million  a decrease of million or from this decline is largely a result of operating losses experienced at piper impact 
while piper impact europe made a solid contribution in its first full year with the company  slack demand in asia and the general motors strike adversely affected sales for piper impact products in north american markets 
the fabricated products lines within this business showed modest improvement over fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal by million  or  compared to fiscal this increase is largely a result of the inclusion of a full year of piper impact europe  which was not included in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increased depreciation resulted from the inclusion of piper impact europe in and the increased depreciation at piper impact for the steel products plant partially offset by lower depreciation at the engineered steel bar business 
interest expense and capitalized interest interest expense decreased by million compared to fiscal as a result of reducing bank borrowings with proceeds received from the sale of lasalle and the tubing operations 
capitalized interest increased by thousand in compared to primarily due to phase iii and iv of the macsteel expansion projects 
other other  net consists largely of investment income and remained relatively constant 
income from continuing operations the company had a loss from continuing operations of million in included in this loss was the after tax non recurring restructuring charge of million 
income from continuing operations excluding the restructuring charge was million  an improvement of million  or  compared to fiscal the improvement was attributable to improved results in the company s engineered steel bars and aluminum mill sheet businesses  and the inclusion of a full year of piper impact europe and lower interest expense 
these improvements were partially offset by lower operating results at piper impact 
the company s effective income tax rate was for fiscal and income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for fiscal  was million which consisted of the tubing operations and lasalle steel 
there was no income from discontinued operations in fiscal see note to the financial statements net income fiscal net income was million  compared to million for fiscal included in net income for fiscal is an after tax non recurring restructuring charge of million and an after tax gain of million on the sale of discontinued operations 
included in net income for was an after tax gain of million on the sale of discontinued operations 
compared to net sales net sales for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million when compared to fiscal this increase resulted principally from a full year of piper impact sales in compared to three months in and higher volumes in the engineered steel bar business 
net sales for fiscal from the company s engineered steel bar business were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was attributable to record volume 
an increase in volume resulted from improved market share following the company s capacity expansion program 
net sales from the company s aluminum mill sheet products business for fiscal were million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was mostly attributable to increased volume 
net sales from the company s engineered products business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million or 
this increase was mostly attributable to a full year of piper impact in compared to three months in operating income consolidated operating income for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase resulted from improved sales and operating income from the engineered steel bar business  partly offset by lower operating income from the aluminum mill sheet products business 
operating income from the company s engineered steel bar business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of million  or  when compared to fiscal this increase was principally due to increased sales following the company s capacity expansion program but operating income was also affected by higher accruals to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these higher accruals were necessary as the engineered steel bar business increased sales during the past several years 
operating income from the company s aluminum mill sheet products business for fiscal was million  representing a decrease of million  or  when compared to fiscal this decrease was principally due to volatility in the aluminum scrap markets  resulting in higher average raw material costs and lower price spreads 
operating income from the company s engineered products business for fiscal was million  representing an increase of thousand  or  when compared to fiscal the results for included a full year of piper impact in compared to three months in fourth quarter results of were affected by start up costs  including higher labor and training expenses and the temporary use of less efficient production processes at piper impact s new plant in new albany  mississippi 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal by million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was principally due to higher accruals to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the prior year affecting the engineered steel bar and the aluminum mill sheet products businesses 
these higher accruals were needed because the company experienced million in bad debts during the year ended october   and to recognize risks associated with higher sales volume achieved during the past several years 
fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were also affected by a full year of piper impact compared to three months in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal increased depreciation resulting from a full year of piper impact was partly offset by lower depreciation at macsteel 
interest expense and capitalized interest interest expense increased by million compared to fiscal primarily due to increased long term debt related to the piper impact acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal capitalized interest increased by million in compared to primarily due to phase iii of the macsteel expansion project and the construction of the new piper impact plant in new albany  mississippi 
other included in other  net for fiscal  was a million pretax gain which represents the final recovery of a business interruption claim related to a fire at the company s lincolnshire  illinois facility that occurred in in addition  other  net included investment income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal income from continuing operations income from continuing operations improved by million  or  compared to fiscal the improvements were principally attributable to improved results at the company s macsteel division

year the company  like other businesses  is facing the year issue 
many computer systems and equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the calendar year 
this could result in computational or operational errors as dates are compared across the century boundary causing possible disruptions in business operations 
the year issue can arise at any point in the company s supply  manufacturing  processing  distribution  and financial chains 
state of readiness the company began addressing the year issue in  with an initial assessment of year readiness efforts at each of its operating units 
based on the responses from the operating units  a standardized year plan format was developed 
by july  each operating unit had completed a year plan that included the following components inventory of all systems including hardware  software  and equipment with embedded chips or processors  assessment of all systems for year compliance  development of a project schedule for replacement or remediation of non compliant systems  development of a project schedule for testing compliant systems  and development of a list of significant vendors suppliers for surveying their year readiness efforts 
the year issue is being addressed within the company by its individual business units  and progress is reported periodically to management 
the company has committed resources to conduct risk assessment and to take corrective action  where required  with a target date of becoming year ready for the most critical systems by july macsteel  the most profitable and significant business segment of the company  has already replaced and or remediated its most critical business systems to become year ready with testing scheduled for march the operating units of the other two business segments are in the process of upgrading or replacing their enterprise resource planning erp systems with versions that are certified to be year ready by the manufacturers of such products 
the implementation of these erp systems is anticipated to be complete by july with respect to the plant systems  including automation and embedded chips used in manufacturing operations  all business units are in the process of completing their inventory and assessment audits 
the company is relying on vendor certification and testing 
assessment and testing  with corrective action as required  is expected to be completed by the third quarter of with respect to the external parties  including suppliers and customers  the company s business units are in the process of surveying the year readiness efforts of critical external parties 
risk assessment is expected to be completed by march and monitoring risk in this area will continue into the third quarter of  as many external parties will not have completed their year readiness efforts 
in addition  the company is developing contingency plans intended to mitigate possible disruption in business operations that may result from the year issue 
contingency plans may include stockpiling necessary materials and inventories  securing alternate sources of supply  adjusting facility shutdown and start up schedules  development of manual procedures to execute transactions and complete processes and other appropriate measures 
once developed  contingency plans will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
cost the year activities and associated costs are being managed within each business unit 
the company s total cost relating to the year activities is not expected to exceed million 
risks quanex is a diversified and decentralized company comprised of three business segments 
each of these segments has multiple operating units  resulting in thirteen separate year plans 
quanex has not required standardized systems throughout the company 
this diversification has allowed the company to spread the risk of the year issue  since no one system is responsible for the entire financial and operational needs of the company 
while the diversification reduces the risk of a material year issue affecting the entire company  this same diversification increases the possibility that the year issue will occur at one or more units since many more systems exist than in a centralized environment 
management is addressing this issue by requiring regular periodic reporting from each business unit and monitoring the progress with follow up review by independent consultants 
however  if implementation of the erp systems at two major business units and replacement remediation of other critical non compliant systems is not completed in a timely manner  the affected units will implement contingency plans to minimize disruptions in business operations that may result from the year issue 
the company relies on third party suppliers for raw materials  water  utilities  transportation and other key services 
interruption of supplier operations due to year issues could affect the company s operations 
while each business unit will evaluate the status of its major suppliers year readiness efforts and develop contingency plans to manage the risk  it can not eliminate the potential for disruption due to third party failures 
the company is also dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
year interruptions in the operations of its major customers could result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels and cash flow reductions 
the company is in the process of surveying its major customers year readiness efforts to assess risk and develop plans with an intent to minimize the impact on its operations 
the company believes that it is taking all reasonable steps to ensure year readiness 
its ability to meet the projected goals  including the costs of addressing the year issue and the dates upon which compliance will be attained  depends on the year readiness of its key suppliers and customers  the completion of its final remediation and testing efforts and the successful development and implementation of contingency plans 
although these and other unanticipated year issues could have an adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company  it is not possible to estimate the extent of impact at this time  since the contingency plans are still under development 
all statements regarding year matters contained in this annual report on form k are year readiness disclosures within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services among the participating countries 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash banking transactions 
the existing local currencies  or legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january  beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash transactions 
for a period of six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro 
at the current time  the company does not believe that the conversion to the euro will have a material impact on its business or its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosure the following discussion of the company and its subsidiaries exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
for a description of the company s significant accounting policies associated with these activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries have a revolving credit facility  convertible subordinated debentures  interest rate swap agreements and other long term debt which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at october   the company had fixed rate debt totaling million 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the conversion feature of the company s subordinated debentures makes it impractical to estimate the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates 
this is due to the high correlation between the market value of these instruments and the market value of the company s common stock 
in general  any changes in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries floating rate obligations total million at october  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the exposure of these obligations to increases in short term interest rates is limited by interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company 
these swap agreements effectively fix the interest rate on all of the company s variable rate debt  thus limiting the potential impact that increasing interest rates would have on earnings 
under these swap agreements  payments are made based on a fixed rate million at  and million at and received on a libor based variable rate at october  
at october   the unrealized losses related to the interest rate swap agreements are million 
if the floating rates were to change by from october  levels  the fair market value of these swaps would change by approximately million 
however  it should be noted that any change in value of these contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company is subject to significant exposure from fluctuations in us dollar dutch guilder exchange rates 
as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to limit transactional exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
at october   the company had separate contracts maturing in monthly increments to purchase an aggregate notional amount of million in foreign currency
