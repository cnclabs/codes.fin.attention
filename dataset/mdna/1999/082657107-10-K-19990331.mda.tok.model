sales and cost of sales 
the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to an decrease in sales by the registrant s french subsidiary  chimos lbf  to  the decrease in chimos lbf s revenues was due to its divestiture on june   combined with a decrease in its sales prior to the divestiture 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in sales calculated in local currency by the registrant s spanish subsidiary  laboratorios belmac 
however  fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates reduced the increase in sales to  when reported in us dollars  to  the registrant s revenues began to decline beginning in the second quarter of  due to the march  expiration of its distribution agreement for the product  ceredase  which accounted for approximately of its revenues in the year ended december  ceredase gross margins  as a percent of sales  were approximately 
gross margins for the year ended december  improved to when compared to gross margins of in the prior year  primarily as a result of the higher proportion of sales from laboratorios belmac  whose sales generated significantly higher gross margins than those of chimos lbf  as well as the loss of low margin ceredase sales

operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the prior year

other income expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of the prior year

interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of the prior year

per common share for the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources total assets decreased from  at december  to  at december   while common stockholders equity increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in common stockholders equity reflects primarily the loss incurred by the registrant for the year ended december   offset by the effect of conversion of series a preferred stock into shares of common stock  issuance of stock purchase warrants and by the positive impact of the spanish peseta exchange rate on the foreign currency translation adjustment 
the registrant s working capital decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as a result of the loss from operations incurred by the registrant during the period  including a non recurring charge of  related to the write off of previously capitalized acquisition costs and the use of cash for acquisition of drug licenses in spain and for manufacturing facility renovations 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as a result of using cash for operating activities including costs associated with the abandoned schwarz acquisition  the acquisition of drug licenses in spain and renovation of the manufacturing facility in spain

as the registrant markets more pharmaceutical products whose sales are seasonal  seasonality of sales may become more significant 
financings 
an aggregate of  units the units were sold in a february public offering 
each unit consisted of a one thousand dollars  principal amount convertible senior subordinated debenture due february  the debentures and  class a redeemable warrants  each to purchase one share of common stock and one class b redeemable warrant 
two class b redeemable warrants entitle a holder to purchase one share of common stock 
the debentures and class a redeemable warrants initially traded only as a unit but began trading separately on may  interest on the debentures is payable quarterly 
the debentures are convertible prior to maturity  unless previously redeemed  at any time commencing february  the anniversary date into shares of common stock at a conversion price per share of 
gross and net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and the other expenses of the offering were approximately  and  respectively  a portion of which were used to retire  principal balance of debt incurred in previous private placements 
of the unit purchase price of  for financial reporting purposes  the consideration allocated to the debenture was  to the conversion discount feature of the debenture was and to the  class a warrants was none of the unit purchase price was allocated to the class b warrants 
such allocation was based upon the relative fair values of each security on the date of issuance 
such allocation resulted in recording a discount on the debentures of approximately  the effective interest rate on the debentures is 
in order to generate working capital necessary to sustain the registrant s long range strategic objectives  the registrant temporarily lowered the exercise price on its class a and class b redeemable warrants 
effective september   the exercise price of the class a warrants was lowered by  to each 
this exercise period at the reduced price expired on december  after this date  the class a warrants reverted back to the original exercise price of per share until their expiration  which has been extended by days to august  holders of the registrant s class a warrants exercised approximately of the outstanding class a redeemable warrants approximately  class a warrants  which generated approximately  in proceeds to the registrant 
the exercise of the class a warrants resulted in issuance of approximately  shares of common stock and approximately  class b warrants 
the exercise price of the registrant s class b redeemable warrants was also temporarily lowered by  to as to each two class b warrants effective september  through january  after january   the warrants reverted back to the original exercise price of per share until their expiration on february  holders of the registrant s class b warrants exercised  class b warrants in january  generating proceeds to the registrant of  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
given the registrant s current liquidity and cash balances and considering its future strategic plans  the registrant should have sufficient liquidity to fund operations into the year  which should be a sufficient time frame for the registrant to advance its strategic objectives and generate revenues and cash flow to support the registrant s cash flow needs 
the registrant  however  continues to explore alternative sources for financing its business activities 
in appropriate situations  that will be strategically determined  the registrant may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contribution by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development  testing  manufacturing and marketing of products under development and the sale of certain of the assets of  or its subsidiary 
impact of the year issue the year issue has arisen because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits of any particular year  rather than all four digits  to identify that year 
these computer programs can not properly distinguish between the years and or and  for example 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the year issue can affect information technoogy it as well as non it sytems 
in fact  many non it systems typically include imbedded technology such as microcontrollers 
these types of systems are more difficult to assess and repair than it systems 
it may even be necessary to replace non it systems if they cannot be modified 
the extent of the potential impact of the year issue is not yet known  and if not timely corrected  could affect the global economy 
the registrant has recognized the need to ensure that its business operations will not be adversely impacted by the year issue and is aware of the time sensitive nature of the problem 
as a result  the registrant has assessed how it may be impacted by the year issue 
consequently  the registrant is in the process of modifying  where needed  its computer applications to ensure that they will function properly beyond the registrant has replaced certain systems and applications and is in the process of replacing other systems and or applications with the assistance of external consultants 
the registrant believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software applications  which are year compliant  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the registrant 
for example  not only is it possible that management may not have access to vital information  which is used to make management decisions  but the manufacturing process could even be interrupted  due to unavailability of raw materials or inoperable equipment and or systems 
the registrant has polled its significant suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which it is vulnerable to a failure of any such third party to adequately address its own year issue 
the registrant s total year project cost and estimates to complete include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the registrant s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the registrant s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the registrant 
the registrant has determined it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold or anticipates selling in the future 
the registrant plans to complete the year project by september  the total remaining cost of the year project is estimated at  of the total project cost  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software  which is being capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
to date  the registrant has incurred and expensed approximately  related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
the costs of the year project and the date on which the registrant plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
because of the importance of addressing the year issue  the registrant is developing contingency plans to address any issues that may not be corrected by implementation of the registrant s year project in a timely manner 
such contingency plans may include considerations such as stock piling of raw matierals  production of greater than normal quantities of finished goods  and implementation of manual back up systems where appropriate 
derivative instruments and hedging statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas was issued in june and establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  gains and losses depends upon the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation if used as a hedge 
fas is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   and is not intended to be applied retroactively 
management does not believe that the adoption of fas will have a significant impact on the registrant s consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
a substantial amount of the registrant s business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced by the extent to which there are fluctuations in the dollar s value against other currencies  specifically the euro and the peseta 
on january   the euro became the official currency of european union eu member states with a fixed conversion rate against their national currencies 
the value of the euro against the dollar and all other currencies  including those of the four eu member states that are not participating in the eurozone  will fluctuate according to market conditions 
although euro notes and coins will not appear until january   the new currency can be used by consumers  retailers  companies and public administrations from january   in the form of written money  ie by means of checks  traveler s checks  bank transfers  credit card transactions  etc 
the permanent value of one euro is fixed at pesetas 
the exchange rate at december  and was and pesetas per us dollar  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate for the years ended december  and was and pesetas per us dollar  respectively 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was an increase of  and the cumulative historical effect was a decrease of  as reflected in the registrant s consolidated balance sheets in the liabilities and stockholders equity section 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  the registrant does not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to the registrant s results of operations as the expenses related to much of the registrant s foreign currency revenues are in the same currency as such revenues 
however  the carrying value of assets and reported values can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation 
nonetheless  the registrant does not plan to modify its business practices 
the registrant has relied primarily upon financing activities to fund the operations of the registrant in the united states 
in the event that the registrant is required to fund united states operations or cash needs with funds generated in spain  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on the registrant 
however  at the present time  the registrant does not anticipate altering its business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations
