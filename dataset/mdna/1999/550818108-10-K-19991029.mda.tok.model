in process research and development 
during  the company initiated a strategy of purchasing selected technologies as opposed to developing the products in house  in an effort to enhance the speed with which the company could bring new product offerings to market 
from february through july  the company purchased two such technologies of significance homepage building tools from tripod  inc in february  and automated directory services from wisewire  inc in april each of these companies were in early stages of development  had yet to develop any significant revenue streams and had devoted most of its efforts to date in the development of new technologies for the internet 
as a result of acquisitions during  the company recorded an in process research and development charge of million  representing the purchased in process research and development that has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
subsequent to the end of its fiscal year end  the company continued its acquisition strategy 
however  whereas the previous acquisitions had focused on purchasing technologies  the addition of whowhere  inc in august and wired ventures  inc in october centered around adding new users as well as a suite of more established products and services to the company s product offerings 
this change in focus was part of the company s strategic initiative to change the company from a technology focus to a mass market media company 
the following is a description of each of the company s acquisitions  including a summary of all major in process research and development projects at the time of acquisition 
the technologies described below for each acquisition have been determined to be in process research and development assets 
these technologies have not reached a state of technological feasibility as of the acquisition date  nor do they exhibit any alternative future use or uses as determined by management 
tripod  inc lycos acquired tripod  inc  on february  for total purchase consideration of million 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was million or approximately of the total purchase price 
at the acquisition date  tripod s major in process project was the development of an advanced home page building hpb technology and related web site management infrastructure to integrate and support this new hpb technology 
the objective of the project was to develop and package a community building technology product that could be licensed to other companies to build and manage their own community oriented sites 
the new hpb technology was designed to build everything from simple web pages to complex web sites 
beyond the basic technology  the in process hpb technology would offer two important features plug ins and templates 
plug ins provide new interactive software tools to homepage builders without altering the basic hpb technology 
for instance  plug ins can enable users to easily add games  quizzes  electronic commerce capabilities and other interactive elements to their homepages 
the hpb technology will also provide multiple template types  allowing a user to fill in a web form and build an electronic brochure without learning the html programming language 
at the date of acquisition  management estimated that completion of the hpb technology product would be accomplished by may  the initial development effort to create a licensable hpb technology product had commenced in june  the major obstacle to launching the product was completing software development  integrating the various components into a functional online system  completing the application programming interface api and the development of a user interface 
at the acquisition date  the new hpb technology product had not reached a completed prototype stage and beta testing had not yet commenced 
the project was delayed due to unexpected technical difficulty in completing software development  integrating and packaging the technology and creating a new user interface that performed in a live production environment 
at the acquisition date  approximately man months of effort had been invested in the hpb project and related development 
an additional man months of effort was necessary to complete the project in september at the time of the lycos purchase  the project was approximately complete 
wisewire  inc lycos acquired wisewire  inc  on april   for a total purchase price of million 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development was million or approximately of the total purchase price 
the theoretical concepts underlying wisewire s technology were conceived at carnegie mellon s artificial intelligence labs 
the wisewire technology is generally described by management as super personalization through adaptive machine learning techniques 
despite four years of development at carnegie mellon university and another three years at wisewire corporation  the primary components of the technology still had not yet reached a state of technological feasibility as of the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  wisewire was developing two primary product lines wisewire community directory  aimed at the consumer user and those web sites that seek to attract high volumes of consumers  and wisewire for web sites wisewire professional for the corporate intranet market segment 
the community directory was intended to enable clients to utilize wisewire s machine learning and collaborative filtering technology to rapidly deploy a full featured directory of web  net news  product descriptions  and proprietary content 
wisewire community directory product automatically creates and manages the entire directory structure eliminating the need for large editorial support 
the directory is intended to be dynamic in that it is constantly changing and being updated with new material independent of actions by an editorial staff 
over time  the content will change and reflect the needs and interests of the community of users 
at the acquisition date  a prototype of this product was being used to power the web guides on lycos  however  it is estimated that only about one third of the technology s long term intended performance capability and functionality was being utilized 
although a subset of the community directory technology was developed and was functioning at the lycos site in a limited capacity  approximately two thirds of its intended performance capability and feature set was still in development at the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  approximately man months of effort had been invested in the project and it was estimated that the community directory r d project would be completed within three to four months 
thus  at the time of the lycos purchase  the project was estimated to be approximately complete 
in addition to the community directory  wisewire was developing two other components of its product line as part of an expanded offering to the corporate  rather than consumer user wisewire for web sites the wisewire for web sites product will allow companies to easily integrate the wisewire technology into their existing web site  offering direct links to continuously updated  real time information specific to their business objectives 
wisewire uses artificial intelligence to search the broadest variety of online content tailored to the topics that their users have defined 
sources include hundreds of online newspapers and periodicals  web pages  online discussion groups  news wire feeds  and even the company s own proprietary content 
since the wisewire technology is interactive  users of the site contribute to the evolution and quality of the information 
wisewire professional the wisewire professional product provides a low cost  high value tool for personalizing a company s view of the internet 
wisewire technology easily integrates with the company s existing online network to give their employees high quality information while blocking content that is not applicable or is recreational in nature 
at the acquisition date  working prototypes of these products were in the testing and debugging phase 
significant technological advancements regarding portability of the technology to a client s site and scalability for high volume environments had yet to be resolved 
in addition  many of the usability enhancements described below needed to be integrated with the products so that customers could actually use the product as designed without continuous intervention and support by the company 
at the acquisition date  it was estimated that the wisewire for web sites and wisewire professional technology projects would be completed within three to six months  depending on resource availability  at a tax adjusted cost of the wisewire in process technology projects were completed by december in projecting the net earnings attributable to the in process research and development projects  management estimated revenues  revenue growth rates  operating expenses  income taxes  and the costs associated with the utilization of working capital and other complementary assets 
these estimates are based on the following assumptions 
projections of revenue growth over a five year forecast period are based on management s estimates of market potential that are supported by independent industry data regarding the internet 
tripod generated revenues of approximately  in and  in wisewire generated revenues of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year both tripod and wisewire were development stage enterprises when acquired by lycos 
because of the absence of meaningful historical revenues for tripod and wisewire  management projected revenues for the initial year of the forecast period based on its assessment of future market potential and each company s ability to successfully launch its new product offerings 
after the initial year of the five year forecast period  revenues were predicted to grow at rates comparable to the growth of internet users and online activity and the impact such growth would have on internet advertising and electronic commerce 
for tripod  forecasted annual growth rates range from in to in the fifth year of the projection period 
for wisewire  forecasted annual growth rates range from a high of in and then decline to an annual rate of in the fifth year of the forecast 

forecasted operating expenses were estimated at of revenues for both tripod and wisewire 
income taxes were estimated at a provisional rate of 
the estimated after tax margin as a percentage of revenue of is consistent with future industry expectations for businesses operating in this segment of the internet marketplace 
the rate is consistent with a convergence of the industry averages evident in the computer  software and telecommunications industries 
we believe that the rate takes into account on going maintenance and research and development costs typically associated with software technologies  as well as the costs to integrate the products into the lycos network 
as a result of a operating expense ratio  pre tax income is and after tax income is  assuming a tax rate 
we believe that an profit margin is reasonable and consistent with industry expectations 

the return on working capital and other assets necessary to support the growth of each company has been estimated so as to derive an income stream specifically attributable to the in process technology 
net working capital requirements have been estimated at of revenues 
the rate applied to working capital reflects the long term expectation for interest rates for working capital loans 
the projected return on working capital is based upon a market rate of return of  or on an after tax basis 
tangible assets have been estimated based upon the level of tangible assets currently deployed in each business and upon anticipated capital expenditures for normal asset replacement 
the tangible asset base required to support tripod s r d activities is estimated at approximately  over the year forecast period 
the tangible asset base required to support wisewire s r d activities is estimated at approximately  over the year forecast period 
the interest rate applied to fixed assets reflects the long term lending rate expectation for financing the purchase of equipment 
the projected return on tangible assets is based upon a market rate of return estimate of  or on an after tax basis 

the calculated weighted average cost of capital wacc is approximately 
the rate was based upon an analysis of the wacc for publicly traded companies within the same industry 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise 
the required rate of return for working capital and tangible assets would generally be lower than the wacc given the fact that less risk is associated with such assets 
as stated above  management estimates an return on working capital and a return on tangible assets 
for intangible assets that reflect a considerably higher degree of risk  such as in process technology  a rate range of to has been utilized depending on the relevant risk of the earning stream associated with the technology 
the risk rates used to present value the earnings streams relating to in process research and development are approximately higher than the rates used for valuing the developed technology 
we believe that this additional increment in the discount rate accounts for the additional risks involved in completing the project and gaining customer acceptance 
if actual results differ significantly from the above assumptions  the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
in addition  the value of other assets acquired may become impaired 
sales and marketing

amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased million to million for the year ended july   representing of revenues 
the increase is attributable to increased amortization related to developed technology and goodwill and other intangible assets recorded upon the acquisitions of tripod  wisewire and guestworld

year compliance lycos system may experience difficulties related to year computer problems 
the codes of many currently installed computer systems and software products accept only two digit entries in the date code field and cannot distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
many companies software and computer systems  including those of lycos and the companies on which lycos depends  may need to be upgraded or replaced so that they will be able to distinguish st century dates from th century dates in order to comply with year requirements and therefore be year compliant 
lycos state of year readiness 
lycos is currently evaluating the year readiness of the hardware and software products it sells  the information technology systems it uses and its non information technology systems  like building security  voice mail and other systems 
this evaluation includes the following phases identification of all hardware and software products it sells and information technology systems and non information technology systems it uses  assessment of repair or replacement requirements  repair or replacement  testing  implementation  and creation of contingency plans in the event of year failures 
lycos has completed its assessment of all current versions of these hardware and software products and believes that they are year compliant 
lycos is currently completing its testing of these systems which it expects to complete by december  there can be no assurance that these tests will be successful 
whether a complete system or device that uses hardware or software used by lycos will process st century dates depends on other components that are supplied by parties other than lycos 
lycos is in the process of contacting vendors regarding whether their software is year compliant 
lycos relies  both domestically and internationally  upon various service providers that are outside of its control including various vendors  governmental agencies  utility companies  telecommunications service companies  delivery service companies  and other service providers 
these third parties may suffer a year business disruption caused by the inability of various systems to process st century dates that could hinder lycos ability to conduct its business 
to the extent that lycos fails to identify and remedy any non compliant internal or external year problems  or the year phenomenon creates a systemic failure beyond lycos control  like a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure or a prolonged failure of third party software on which lycos relies  lycos could be prevented from operating its business and permitting users access to its web sites 
costs of year compliance to lycos 
to date  lycos has not incurred any material expenditures in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
most of its expenses thus far relate to retaining third party consultants to assist lycos in its compliance efforts and to the opportunity cost of time spent by lycos employees evaluating its software  the current versions of the hardware and software sold by lycos and year compliance matters generally 
status of lycos contingency plan 
lycos has not yet developed a year specific contingency plan 
if lycos discovers year compliance issues  it will evaluate the need for contingency plans relating to these issues

netscape or to enter into additional distribution relationships and strategic alliances  the ability of the company to maintain and increase levels of traffic on its web sites  the ability of the company to continue to develop or acquire content  features and functionality for its services  the development of equal or superior services or products by competitors  the failure of the market to adopt the web as an advertising or commercial medium  the reduction in market prices for web based advertising as a result of competition or otherwise  the company s ability to effectively generate commerce related revenues through sponsored services and placements in lycos services  the company s success in attracting  retaining and motivating qualified personnel and changes in the law governing activities in which the company participates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
the limited operating history of the company makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult or impossible  and therefore  the recent revenue growth experienced by the company should not be taken as indicative of the rate of growth  if any  that can be expected in the future 
the company has incurred significant losses since inception 
the company reported a loss of per share a loss per share before amortization and one time acquisition related charges for the year ended july  and there can be no assurance that the company will sustain revenue growth or maintain profitability in the future 
as of july   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results 
as a result of the company s limited operating history  the company does not have historical financial data for any significant period of time on which to base planned operating expenses 
the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenues and to a certain extent are fixed 
quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on the advertising  electronic commerce  license fees and other revenues received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
because the company s expense levels are based upon anticipated advertising  electronic commerce and licensing revenue  the company may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in relation to the company s expectations would have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company plans to significantly increase its operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  increase its sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  broaden its customer support capabilities  maintain brand identity and pursue strategic alliances 
in the future  leading web sites  browser providers and other distribution channels may require payments or other consideration in exchange for providing access to the company s products and services 
additionally  the company may incur costs pertaining to the introduction or enhancement of services offered by the company or the acquisition of businesses or technologies 
to the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenues  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  some of which are outside of the company s control 
these factors include general economic conditions  specific economic conditions in the internet industry  usage of the internet  the level of traffic to the company s web sites  demand for internet advertising and electronic commerce  the addition or loss of advertisers or electronic commerce sponsors  seasonal trends in advertising sales  the advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers  capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of operations  incurrence of costs relating to acquisitions  the introduction of new products or services by the company or its competitors  the mix of the services sold  the channels through which those services are sold  and pricing changes 
as a strategic response to a changing competitive environment  the company may elect from time to time to make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to the nascent nature of the internet industry  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon for an indication of future performance 
the company also has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonality in its business  with user traffic on the company s web sites and the web sites of its partners being lower during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods  when usage of the web and the company s services has typically declined 
due to all of the foregoing factors and others that the company cannot predict  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on advertising revenues  risks related to sponsorships 
the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of advertisements on its web pages 
for the fiscal year ended july   advertising revenues represented approximately of the company s total revenues 
the company s strategy is to continue to develop advertising and other methods of generating revenues through the use of its products and services 
the company s ability to increase its advertising revenues will depend  among other things  on advertisers acceptance of the internet as an attractive and sustainable medium  the development of a large base of users of the company s products and services possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers  the expansion of the company s advertising sales force and the development of the internet as an attractive platform for electronic commerce 
in addition  there is fluid and intense competition in the sale of advertising on the internet  resulting in a wide range of rates quoted and a variety of pricing models offered by different vendors for a variety of advertising services  which makes it difficult to project future levels of advertising revenues that will be realized generally or by any specific company 
it is also difficult to predict which pricing models will be adopted by the industry or advertisers 
for example  advertising rates based on the number of click throughs from the company s network to advertisers pages  instead of rates based solely on the number of impressions  could materially adversely affect the company s revenues 
in addition  filter software programs that limit or remove advertising from the web user s desktop are available 
the widespread adoption of such software by users could have a material adverse effect on the viability of advertising on the web 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating significant future advertising revenues  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  significant and consistent investment on the internet by many advertisers is dependent upon validation that the internet is an effective advertising medium  which validation has not yet occurred and which is essential to the achievement of steady and predictable advertising revenues 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business advertising 
the company has entered into sponsorship arrangements with third parties to provide sponsored services and placements on the company s web sites in addition to traditional banner advertising 
in connection with these arrangements  the company may receive sponsorship fees as well as a portion of transaction revenues received by such third party sponsors from users originated through the company s web sites  in return for minimum levels of user impressions or click throughs to be provided by the company 
to the extent implemented  these arrangements expose the company to potentially significant financial risks  including the risk that the company fails to deliver required minimum levels of user impressions or click throughs in which case  these agreements typically provide for adjustments to the fees payable thereunder or make good periods and that third party sponsors do not renew the agreements at the end of their terms 
certain of these arrangements also require the company to integrate sponsors content with the company s services  which requires the dedication of resources and significant programming and design efforts to accomplish 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract additional sponsors or that it will be able to renew existing sponsorship arrangements when they expire 
in addition  the company has granted exclusivity provisions to certain of its sponsors  and may in the future grant additional exclusivity provisions 
such exclusivity provisions may have the effect of preventing the company  for the duration of such exclusivity arrangements  from accepting advertising or sponsorship arrangements within a particular subject matter in the company s web sites or across the company s entire service 
the inability of the company to enter into further sponsorship or advertising arrangements as a result of its exclusivity arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business advertising and electronic commerce 
the internet as a commercial endeavor has been in existence for a short period of time 
the costs of establishing a web site are low  and new online service providers  content providers and advertisers are being launched regularly 
many of these companies are funded with venture capital and other forms of financing before they have proven both that their particular industry segment and their business strategy will be successful 
those companies that are unable to prove themselves successful before their initial funding is depleted may find it difficult or impossible to secure additional funding 
the failure of any of the company s advertisers or electronic commerce sponsors to pay amounts due to the company on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with electronic commerce 
the company believes that the portion of its business dedicated to electronic commerce will play a significant role in the company s future financial growth and development 
in order to support its electronic commerce initiative  the company must rely on the efficiencies and proper business practices of its third party suppliers 
the failure of such third parties to provide quality service to users of the company s web sites  timely deliver to such users the products purchased by users on the company s web sites  or deliver superior products may result in user dissatisfaction  which may  in turn  cause users to stop visiting the company s web sites or using the company s services 
in addition  to the extent that the company is an intermediary in such electronic commerce transactions  there is the potential that users may involve the company in claims associated with the sale of goods  including  without limitation  claims relating to product liability and consumer protection 
dependence on third party relationships 
the company is dependent on a number of third party relationships  including its relationship with netscape  to create traffic on the company s web sites and consequently generate revenues 
these relationships include arrangements relating to the positioning of the company s products and services on web browsers such as those offered by netscape and microsoft  and on other sites through license agreements in which internet sites are linked to or otherwise utilize the company s services 
for the fiscal year ended july   a significant portion of the traffic to the company s web sites was derived through the netscape and microsoft browsers 
in may  the company s agreement with microsoft expired and was not renewed 
however  on june   the company renewed its one year premier provider agreement with netscape the netscape agreement pursuant to which the company is designated as a premier provider of search and navigation services accessible from the net search button on the netscape browser through june  under the terms of the netscape agreement  as subsequently amended  netscape will commit search exposures during the one year term of the netscape agreement to the company s search services in exchange for a per impression payment by the company based on the actual number of exposures delivered to the company by netscape 
because netscape provides only exposures from its net search page as compared to a number of users who click through to the company s web sites  there can be no assurance that the netscape agreement will provide the company s web sites with material amounts of traffic 
although the netscape agreement may only be terminated under certain limited circumstances  if the company were unable to continue as a premier provider  the company s web sites could lose a material portion of their traffic  traffic on competing services could substantially increase  and the company s web sites could otherwise become less attractive to advertisers  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a traffic reduction could  in turn  result in advertisers on the company s web sites  including sponsors and partners  terminating their contracts with the company  as such contracts are typically of short duration and terminable on relatively short notice  or reducing the number of impressions purchased 
furthermore  the company s contracts with advertisers and sponsors generally guarantee a minimum number of page views  and a failure to achieve the minimum page views could result in a reduction in payments to the company or compel the company to provide make good impressions if such minimums are not met 
if the company is unable to maintain its relationships with third parties to create traffic on the company s web sites or is otherwise unable to offset a reduction in traffic  advertising revenues would be materially adversely affected  resulting in a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business strategic alliances 
the company is also dependent on web site operators that provide links to the company s web sites and  for certain elements of the company s properties  the company licenses technology and related databases from third parties  including directories  chat  street mapping and other similar services 
the company believes that certain of its third party relationships are important to its ability to attract traffic and advertisers 
any errors  failures or delays experienced in connection with these third party technologies and information services could alienate the company s users and adversely affect the company s brand and its business 
although the company views these relationships as important direct and indirect factors in the generation of revenues  many of the company s arrangements do not include minimum commitments to use the company s services or to provide access or links to the company s products or services in the future  are not exclusive and generally have a term of only one to three years 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s partners regard their relationship with the company as important to their own respective businesses and operations  that they will not reassess their commitment to the company s products or services at any time in the future  or that they will not develop their own competitive products or services 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing relationships will result in sustained business partnerships  successful product or service offerings or the generation of significant revenues for the company 
failure of one or more of the company s partnering relationships to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success  or the termination of one or more successful partnering relationships  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the termination of the company s position on a web browser  or the grant to a competitor of an exclusive arrangement with respect to positioning on a web browser  would significantly reduce traffic on the company s web sites  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition 
the market for internet products and services is highly competitive 
in addition  the market for internet advertising and electronic commerce arrangements is intensely competitive and the company expects that competition will continue to intensify 
although the company believes that the diverse segments of the internet market will provide opportunities for more than one supplier of products and services similar to those of the company  it is possible that a single supplier may dominate one or more market segments 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market are name recognition  distribution arrangements  performance  ease of use  a variety of value added services  functionality and features  and quality of support 
a number of companies offer competitive products addressing certain of the company s target markets 
the primary competitors of the company s products and services are other companies providing online services  including about 
com  inc formerly the mining company  america online including netscape s netcenter and compuserve  cmgi s alta vista  excite home including webcrawler  theglobe 
com  inc  disney s infoseek corporation  looksmart ltd  microsoft s msn  nbc s snap  xoom  inc  and yahoo inc 
including geocities 
in addition  a number of companies offering internet products and services  including direct competitors of the company  recently have begun to integrate multiple features within the products and services they offer to consumers 
integration of internet products and services is occurring through development of competing products and through acquisitions of  or entering into joint ventures and or licensing arrangements involving  competitors of the company 
for example  the web browsers offered by netscape and microsoft  which are the two most widely used browsers and substantial sources of traffic for the company  may incorporate and promote information search and retrieval capabilities in future releases or upgrades that could make it more difficult for internet viewers to find and use the company s products and services 
in addition  many large media companies have announced that they are contemplating developing or acquiring internet navigation services and are attempting to become gateway sites for web users 
in the event these companies develop such portal sites  the company could lose a substantial portion of its user traffic  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  entities that sponsor or maintain high traffic web sites or that provide an initial point of entry for internet viewers  such as the regional bell operating companies or isps such as prodigy  inc and america online  inc  currently offer and can be expected to consider further development  acquisition or licensing of internet search and navigation functions competitive with those offered by the company  or could take actions that make it more difficult for viewers to find and use the company s products and services 
consolidations  integration and strategic relationships involving competitors of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also competes with metasearch services that allow a user to search the databases of several catalogs and directories simultaneously 
the company also competes indirectly with database vendors that offer information search and retrieval capabilities with their core database products 
tripod and angelfire compete with other community based web sites  including yahoo inc s geocities  inc 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not offer internet products and services that are superior to those of the company or that achieve greater market acceptance than the company s offerings 
moreover  a number of the company s current advertising customers and partners have established relationships with certain of the company s competitors  and future advertising customers and partners may establish similar relationships 
the company competes with online services and other web site operators as well as traditional off line media  such as print and television  for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against its current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business competition 
risks associated with brand development 
the company believes that establishing and maintaining the lycos network brand is a crucial aspect of its efforts to continue to expand and attract its internet audience and that the importance of brand recognition will increase in the future due to the growing number of internet sites and the relatively low barriers to entry 
promotion and enhancement of the lycos network brand will depend largely on the company s ability to provide consistently high quality products and services  which cannot be assured 
if consumers do not perceive the company s existing products and services to be of high quality  or if the company introduces new products and services or enters into new business ventures that are not favorably received by consumers  the company will be unsuccessful in promoting and maintaining its brand  and will risk diluting its brand and decreasing the attractiveness of its audiences to advertisers 
developing market  unproven acceptance of the company s products and services  uncertain adoption of the internet as an advertising medium 
the market for the company s products and services has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products and services for use on the internet 
the company s market is highly dependent upon the increased use of the internet for information publication and distribution  commerce  and on the development of the internet as an advertising medium 
the company s future operating results will depend upon the growth of the internet advertising and commerce markets  the successful implementation of the company s advertising program and the company s ability to establish electronic commerce and licensing relationships and other strategic alliances 
there can be no assurance  however  that the internet advertising or commerce market will develop as an attractive and sustainable medium  that the company will achieve or sustain market acceptance of its products and services or that the company will be able to execute its business plan successfully 
as is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the industry is young and has few proven products 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  cost  ease of use and access  quality of service and acceptance of advertising and electronic commerce remain unresolved and may impact the growth of the internet  or the placement of advertisements on the internet or the growth of the internet as a means of electronic commerce 
if commercial use of the internet does not grow  if the internet does not develop as an attractive medium for advertising or electronic commerce  or if the internet infrastructure does not effectively support growth that may occur  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and investments 
the company has completed  and may in the future pursue  acquisitions of companies  technologies or assets that complement the company s business  such as the recent wired ventures and sonique acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates available for sale at reasonable prices  consummate any acquisition or successfully integrate any acquired business into the company s operations 
acquisitions may result in the potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the write off of in process research and development or software acquisition and development costs  and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions would involve numerous additional risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns along with the risks involved in entering markets in which the company has little or no experience 
problems with an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on the performance of the company 
the company has made  and may in the future make  investments in companies involved in the development of technologies or services that are complementary or related to the company s operations 
the company has recently made investments in bidder s edge  valent software  and frictionless commerce 
these companies are in early stages of development and may be expected to incur substantial losses 
there can be no assurance that any investments in such companies will result in any return  nor can there be any assurance as to the timing of any such return  or that the company will not suffer the loss of its entire investment

management of growth  need to establish infrastructure  additional personnel 
the rapid execution necessary for the company to successfully offer its products and services and implement its business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
the company s rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial and operational resources 
to manage its growth  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
further  the company will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with this expansion and transition  that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations  or that the company s management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to offer successfully the company s products and services and implement its business plan 
the company s future operating results will also depend on many factors  including its ability to expand its advertising sales and business development organizations and expand its support organization commensurate with the growth of its business 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
see item a executive officers of the registrant 
risks associated with international expansion 
international sales  primarily from licensing the company s products and services  accounted for less than of the company s revenues for the fiscal year ended july  as part of its business strategy  the company has entered into joint ventures in europe with bertelsmann ag  in may  japan with sumitomo corporation and internet initiative japan iij  in march  korea with mirae corporation  in march  and  after the close of the fiscal year  asia with singapore telecom  in september 
most recently  the company announced that it has launched localized  company owned and operated sites in six south and central american countries 
the company currently offers localized versions of the lycos service in argentina  belgium  brazil  chile  denmark  france  germany  italy  japan  korea  luxembourg  the netherlands  norway  mexico  peru  spain  sweden  switzerland  the united kingdom and venezuela 
the company believes that this expansion is important to the company s ability to continue to grow and to market its products and services 
in marketing its products and services internationally  however  the company will face new competitors 
in addition  the ability of the company to enter international markets will be dependent upon the company s ability to create localized versions of its products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in creating localized versions of its products and services  marketing or distributing its products abroad or that  if the company is successful  its international revenues will be adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining international operations 
to date  the company has limited experience in marketing and distributing its products internationally 
in addition to the uncertainty as to the company s ability to establish an international presence  there are certain difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level  such as compliance with regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements  export restrictions  export controls relating to technology  tariffs and other trade barriers  protection of intellectual property rights  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on any international operations established by the company and  consequently  on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and consolidated financial statements 
dependence on the internet 
the use of the company s products and services will depend in large part upon the development by others of an infrastructure for providing internet access and services 
because global commerce and online exchange of information on the internet and other similar open wide area networks are relatively new and evolving  it is difficult to predict with any certainty whether the internet will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including lack of acceptable security technologies  potentially inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone  or timely development and commercialization of performance improvements  including high speed modems or an alternative to them 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it by such potential growth or that the performance or reliability of the web will not be adversely affected by this continued growth 
in addition  the internet could lose its commercial viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols for example  the next generation internet protocol to handle increased levels of internet activity 
there can be no assurance that the infrastructure or complementary services necessary to make the internet a viable commercial marketplace will be developed or  if developed  that the internet will become a viable commercial marketplace for products and services such as those offered by the company 
if the necessary infrastructure or complementary services or facilities are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace or platform for advertising and electronic commerce  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
risk of capacity constraints and system failure 
a key element of the company s strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic to its products and services  which the company makes available free of charge to users of the internet 
accordingly  the performance of the company s products and services is critical to the company s reputation  its ability to attract advertisers to the company s web sites and the market acceptance of these products and services 
any system failure that causes interruptions in the availability  or increases response time  of the company s products and services could result in less traffic to the company s web sites and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of the company s products and services to advertisers and partners 
an increase in the volume of searches conducted through the company s products and services could strain the capacity of the software or hardware deployed by the company or the capacity of the company s network infrastructure  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
in addition  as the number of web pages and users increases  there can be no assurance that the company s products and services will be able to scale proportionately 
any failure to expand the capacity of the company s hardware or network infrastructure on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is dependent upon web browsers and internet and online service providers for access to its products and services  and users have experienced difficulties due to browser and provider system failures unrelated to the company s systems  products and services 
the company is also dependent on hardware suppliers for prompt delivery  installation and service of servers and other equipment and services used to provide its products and services 
the company outsources substantially all of its hardware operations to third parties 
there can be no assurance that a system failure at any of these locations would not adversely affect the performance of the company s products and services 
this system is vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
the company does not presently have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan  and relies  instead  on maintaining most of its core services on two mirror sites  if one server fails  all of the traffic can be redirected and served from the other server 
despite the implementation of network security measures by the company  its servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems 
computer viruses  break ins or other problems caused by third parties could lead to interruptions  delays or cessation in service to users of the company s products and services 
the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business properties 
advertising management system 
the process of managing advertising within large  high traffic web sites such as the company s is an increasingly important and complex task 
the company licenses from a third party an advertising management system 
to the extent that the company encounters system failures or material difficulties in the operation of this system  the company could be unable to deliver banner advertisements and sponsorships through its web sites 
any extended failure of  or material difficulties encountered in connection with  the company s advertising management system may expose the company to make good obligations with its advertising customers  which  by displacing advertising inventory  among other consequences  would reduce revenue and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

technological change and new products 
the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and customer demands  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
these market characteristics are exacerbated by the emerging nature of this market and the fact that many companies are expected to introduce new internet products in the near future 
the company s future success will depend in significant part on its ability to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of the lycos search and navigation services in response to both evolving demands of the marketplace and competitive product offerings  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful 
in addition  a key element of the company s business strategy is the development  introduction and integration of new products that capitalize on the increasing use of the internet 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or integrating such products or services or that such products and services will meet with market acceptance 
in addition  new product releases by the company may contain undetected errors that require significant design modifications  resulting in a loss of customer confidence and viewer support  which will adversely affect the use of the company s products and services and  consequently  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business strategy and technology  intellectual property and proprietary rights 
intellectual property and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology 
the company currently relies on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees and with its consultants and partners 
the company has registered and applied for registration of certain service marks and trademarks  and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks  as appropriate 
in addition  carnegie mellon university cmu has been issued a patent in the united states relating to lycos search and indexing technology  which has been licensed to the company on a perpetual basis 
there can be no assurance that such patent will not be challenged  and if such challenges are brought  that the patent will not be invalidated 
there also can be no assurance that the company will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide the company with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or services or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and the company does not currently have any patents or patent applications pending in any foreign country 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology or duplicate the company s products or design around patents issued to the company or other intellectual property rights of the company 
there have been substantial amounts of litigation in the computer industry regarding intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not in the future claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products  trademarks or other proprietary rights 
any such claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention  cause product release delays  require the company to redesign its products or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
see business technology 
government regulation and legal uncertainties 
the company currently is subject only to limited direct regulation by government agencies  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the web  it is likely that a number of laws and regulations will be adopted with respect to the web  covering issues such as user privacy  consumer protection  content and database use  and others 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the web  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s services and products or increase the company s cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that  although transmission of the company s services originate from its operations centers in massachusetts  california and new jersey  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions or prosecute the company for violations of their laws 
there can be no assurance that violations of local laws will not be alleged or charged by state or foreign governments  that the company might not unintentionally violate such law or that such laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
it is also possible that states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales taxes on out of state companies that engage in commerce over the internet 
in the event that states or foreign countries succeed in imposing sales or other taxes on internet commerce  the growth of the use of the internet for commerce could slow substantially 
any of the foregoing developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees  all of whom have worked together for only a short period of time
