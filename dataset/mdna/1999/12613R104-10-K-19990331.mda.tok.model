the losses in and reflected substantial expenditures to develop and launch our various internet channels and television programs

the increase in television programming and internet channels has also required increased sales and marketing expenses as well as increased general and administrative costs

advertising rates vary depending upon whether a program is impression or performance based  where advertisements are placed and the amount and length of the advertiser s commitment 
advertising revenues are recognized in the period in which the advertisements are delivered

com  an online comparison shopping service for computer and consumer electronics products 
seasonality we believe that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television  are generally lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year than in the respective preceding quarters and that advertising expenditures fluctuate significantly with economic cycles 
depending on the extent to which the internet is accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality and cyclicality in the level of advertising expenditures generally could become more pronounced for internet advertising 
seasonality and cyclicality in advertising expenditures generally  or with respect to internet based advertising specifically  could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
we may also experience seasonality in our operating results  particularly in connection with our shopping services which may reflect seasonal trends in the retail industry 
the level of consumer retail spending generally decreases in the first and third calendar quarters 
advertising expenditures  which account for substantially all of our revenues  are also subject to seasonal fluctuations and are influenced by consumer spending patterns 
year compliance we are aware of the issues associated with the programming code and embedded technology in existing systems as the year approaches 
the year issue arises from the potential for computers to fail or operate incorrectly because their programs incorrectly interpret the two digit date fields as or some other year  rather than the year the year issue creates risk for us from unforeseen problems in our own computer systems and from third parties  including customers  vendors and manufacturers  with whom we deal 
failures of our and or third parties computer systems could result in an interruption in  or a failure of certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
to mitigate this risk  we have established a formal year program to oversee and coordinate the assessment  remediation  testing and reporting activities related to this issue 
we are currently in the assessment phase of our year program 
as part of this assessment  we will review the following systems to determine if they are year compliant our application systems financial systems  various custom developed business applications technology infrastructure networks  servers  desktop equipment facilities security systems  fire alarm systems vendors partners and products 
this review will include the collection of documentation from software and hardware manufacturers the detailed review of programming code for custom applications the physical testing of desktop equipment using software designed to test for year compliance the examination of key vendors partners year programs the ongoing testing of our products as part of normal quality assurance activities 
we anticipate that we will complete the assessment and remediation phase and begin the testing phase of our year program by the third quarter of we have not made estimates for the costs associated with completing our year program  but will do so after completion of the assessment phase of the project 
costs incurred to date  including costs of personnel  have not been material 
we can offer no assurance that we will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or additional material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems  or by failures of our vendors partners to address their year issues in a timely and effective manner 
should miscalculations or other operational errors occur as a result of the year issue  we or the parties on which we depend may be unable to produce reliable information or to process routine transactions 
furthermore  in the worst case  we or the parties on which we depend may be incapable of conducting critical business activities which include  but are not limited to  the production and delivery of our internet channels  invoicing customers and paying vendors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
cautionary statement regarding factors that may affect our business and our future results our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are any statements other than statements of historical fact 
examples of forward looking statements include projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations  statements concerning proposed new products or services  statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by the use of words such as may  will  expects  believes  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  and any other words of similar meaning 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors mentioned in the discussion in this report will be important in determining future results 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed 
actual future results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our q and k reports to the sec 
also note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks  uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our businesses 
these are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect the company 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of we have a limited operating history and an accumulated deficit 
we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate us 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in developing industries  particularly companies in the relatively new and rapidly evolving market for internet products  content and services 
such risks for us include  but are not limited to an evolving and unpredictable business model uncertain acceptance of new services including cnet shopper 
com competition management of growth 
to address these risks  we must  among other things develop new relationships and maintain existing relationships with our advertising customers  their advertising agencies and other third parties provide original and compelling content to internet users and television viewers develop and upgrade our technology implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy successfully expand into new products  services or markets effectively manage and integrate acquisitions and other business combinations respond to competitive developments attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in addressing such risks 
if we fail to do so  our revenues and operating results could be materially reduced 
additionally  our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete makes the prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we can offer no assurance that our revenues will increase or even continue at their current level or that we will maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
in addition  interest that we pay on our convertible subordinated notes and costs of our acquisitions  including amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles and ongoing operating expenses  will or may further affect our operating results 
from our inception until the third quarter of  we incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may continue to incur losses in the future 
for example  if we were to increase significantly our marketing expenses  which we are considering  it is possible that we would incur losses as a result 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
if currently available cash and cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms that we find acceptable 
we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
factors that may adversely affect our quarterly operating results attributable to our internet operations include  among others demand for internet advertising the addition or loss of advertisers  and the advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers the level of traffic on our network of internet channels the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs including marketing costs relating to the expansion of our internet operations competition our ability to manage effectively our development of new business segments and markets our ability to successfully manage the integration of operations and technology of acquisitions and other business combinations our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure technical difficulties  system downtime or internet brownouts governmental regulation and taxation policies general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the internet and internet media 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our planned expenditures could materially reduce our operating results and adversely affect our financial condition 
quarterly operating results attributable to our television operations are generally dependent on the costs we incur in producing our television programming 
if the costs of producing television programs exceed licensing and distribution revenues  we could incur a gross deficit with respect to our television operations 
as a result of our strategy to cross market our television and internet operations  a decrease in the number of viewers of our television programs may have a negative effect on the usage of our internet channels which would materially reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is likely that our operating results may fall below our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter 
in such event  the trading price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
our internet content and services may not be accepted 
our future success depends upon our ability to deliver original and compelling internet content and services in order to attract and retain users 
we cannot assure you that our content and services will be attractive to a sufficient number of internet users to generate revenues sufficient for us to sustain operations 
if we are unable to develop internet content and services that allow us to attract  retain and expand a loyal user base possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers and sellers of technology products  we will be unable to generate revenue 
our television programming may not be accepted 
we cannot assure you that television broadcasters  cable networks or their viewers will accept our television programming 
the successful development and production of television programming is subject to numerous uncertainties  including the ability to anticipate and successfully respond to rapidly changing consumer tastes and preferences obtain favorable distribution rights fund new program development attract and retain qualified producers  writers  technical personnel and television hosts 
we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenues if we fail to develop television programming that allows us to attract  retain and expand a loyal television audience  or if we fail to retain or develop distribution channels for our television programming 
we face significant competition 
the market for internet content and services is new  intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  there are minimal barriers to entry  and current and new competitors can launch new sites at relatively low cost 
there can be no assurance that we will compete successfully with current or future competitors 
we may have difficulties managing our growth 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and anticipate that further expansion of our operations may be required in order to address potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that our current personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations  that management will be able to identify  hire  train  motivate or manage required personnel or that management will be able to successfully identify and exploit existing and potential market opportunities 
we have risks associated with system development and operations 
our internet revenues consist primarily of revenues derived from the sale of advertisements and other fees from sellers of technology products on our internet channels  in particular from arrangements with our advertising customers that provide for a guaranteed number of impressions 
any system interruptions that result in the unavailability of our internet channels may result in us being unable to deliver the number of impressions guaranteed by such agreements 
during  we experienced two power interruptions which resulted in the unavailability of our internet channels and services for portions of two days 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our internet channels or will be able to  in a timely manner  effectively upgrade and expand our systems 
we are dependent on our advertising revenues 
our revenues through december  were derived primarily from the sale of advertising and other fees from sellers of technology products on our internet channels and from advertising and license fees from producing our television programs 
most of our advertising contracts can be terminated by the customer at any time on very short notice 
if we lose advertising customers  fail to attract new customers or are forced to reduce advertising rates in order to retain or attract customers  our revenues and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the internet may not be accepted as an advertising medium 
our internet advertising customers have only limited experience with the internet as an advertising medium and neither such customers nor their advertising agencies have devoted a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet based advertising in the past 
some of our potential customers have little or no experience with the internet as an advertising medium and have not devoted significant portions of their advertising budgets to internet based advertising in the past 
in order for us to generate advertising revenues  advertisers and advertising agencies must direct a significant portion of their budgets to the internet and  specifically  to our internet sites 
acceptance of the internet among advertisers and advertising agencies also depends to a large extent on the growth of use of the internet by consumers  which is highly uncertain  and on the acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
if internet based advertising is not widely accepted by advertisers and advertising agencies  our revenues and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  users can purchase software that is designed to block banner advertisements from appearing on their computer screens as the user navigates on the internet 
this software is intended to increase the navigation speed for the user 
our revenues could be materially reduced if this software or other ad blocking technology becomes widely used 
brand may not be accepted or maintained 
promotion of the cnet brand will depend largely on our success in providing high quality internet and television programming 
if consumers do not perceive our existing internet and television content to be of high quality  or if we introduce new internet channels or television programs or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by consumers  we will not be successful in promoting and maintaining our brand 
if we are unable to provide high quality content and services or otherwise fail to promote and maintain our brand  or if we incur excessive expenses in an attempt to or promote and maintain our brand  our revenues and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of halsey m 
minor  shelby w 
bonnie and the other members of our senior management team  as well as on our ability to retain and motivate our other officers and key employees 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or other employees 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
the production of content and services for the internet and television requires highly skilled writers and editors and personnel with sophisticated technical expertise 
we have encountered difficulties in attracting qualified software developers for our internet channels and related technologies 
the failure to attract and retain the necessary technical  managerial  editorial and sales personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we have risks associated with television distribution and we are dependent on usa networks 
our television programming is currently carried primarily on the usa network and the sci fi channel  both of which are owned by usa networks  pursuant to an agreement that expires on june  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain distribution for our television programming after june  in such event  our brand  revenues and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with technological change 
the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
the emerging character of these products and services and their rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our internet content  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in responding quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet technologies or standards could require substantial expenditures by us to modify or adapt our internet channels and services and could fundamentally affect the character  viability and frequency of internet based advertising 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we depend on third parties for our internet operations 
we rely on the cooperation of owners and operators of other internet sites in connection with the operation of our internet channels and services 
we can offer no assurance that such cooperation will be available on acceptable commercial terms or at all 
our ability to develop original and compelling internet content and service is also dependent on maintaining relationships with and using products provided by third party vendors of internet development tools and technologies  such as macromedia s shockwave microsoft s activex progressive networks realaudio sun microsystems java our ability to advertise on other internet sites and the willingness of the owners of such sites to direct users to our internet channels through hypertext links are also critical to the success of our internet operations 
if we are unable to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with such third parties on acceptable commercial terms  or if our competitors are better able to leverage such relationships  our financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected 
we have risks associated with our potential acquisitions and investments 
from time to time  we consider new business opportunities and ventures  including acquisitions  in a broad range of areas 
any decision by us to pursue a significant business expansion or new business opportunity would likely require a substantial investment of capital  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to implement our existing business strategy  or the issuance of additional equity interests  which would be dilutive to our current stockholders 
any investment could also result in operating losses for us 
further  the pursuit of expansion or new business opportunities would place additional  substantial burdens on our management personnel and our financial and operational systems 
in addition  we can offer no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to pursue any investment or acquisition 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to develop any new internet channel or service or other new business venture in a cost effective or timely manner or that it would achieve market acceptance 
we cannot assure you that any significant business expansion or new business opportunity would ever be profitable 
we have risks associated with business combinations and strategic alliances 
we may choose to expand our operations or market presence by entering into agreements  business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with third parties  such as our agreement with america online  or our joint venture with an affiliate of nbc to operate the snap 
internet portal service 
any such transaction will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in such transactions  which include  among others the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business the possible inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel additional expenses associated with amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets additional operating losses and expenses associated with the activities and expansion of acquired businesses the possible impairment of relationships with existing employees and advertising customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such business combination  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances  or that such transactions will be profitable 
we are dependent on intellectual property rights and others may infringe upon those rights 
we rely on trade secret and copyright laws to protect our proprietary technologies 
we cannot assure you that such laws will provide sufficient protection  that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to ours  or that third parties will not copy or otherwise obtain and use our technologies without authorization 
we have risks associated with domain names 
we currently hold various web domain names relating to our brand and sites 
the acquisition and maintenance of domain names generally is regulated by governmental agencies and their designees 
for example  in the united states  the national science foundation has appointed network solutions  inc as the current exclusive registrar for the 
com  
net and 
org generic top level domains 
the regulation of domain names in the united states and in foreign countries is subject to change 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire or maintain relevant domain names in all countries in which we conduct business 
furthermore  the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting trademarks and similar proprietary rights is unclear 
we  therefore  may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to  or infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
any such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have risks associated with government regulation and legal uncertainties 
although there are currently few laws and regulations directly applicable to the internet  it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted covering issues such as privacy  copyrights  obscene or indecent communications and the pricing  characteristics and quality of internet products and services 
the adoption of restrictive laws or regulations could decrease the growth of the internet or expose us to significant liabilities 
we are dependent on the continued growth in use of the internet 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent phenomenon 
we can offer no assurance that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficient base of users will emerge to support our business 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience an increase in users  an increase in frequency of use or an increase in the bandwidth requirements of users  we can offer no assurance that the internet infrastructure will be able to support the demands placed upon it 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability as a commercial medium due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or due to increased government regulation 
if use of the internet does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  or if the internet infrastructure does not effectively support growth that may occur  our revenues and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
we have capacity constraints and may be subject to system disruptions 
the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our internet channels and our network infrastructure are critical to attracting internet users and maintaining relationships with advertising customers 
our internet advertising revenues are directly related to the number of advertisements delivered by us to users 
system interruptions that result in the unavailability of our internet channels or slower response times for users would reduce the number of advertisements delivered and reduce the attractiveness of our internet channels to users and advertisers 
we have experienced periodic system interruptions in the past and believe that such interruptions will continue to occur from time to time in the future 
any increase in system interruptions or slower response times resulting from the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
our internet and television operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
all of our servers and television production equipment is currently located in san francisco  california  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes 
since launching our first internet site in june  we have experienced system downtime for limited periods of up to a few hours due to power loss and telecommunications failures  and there can be no assurance that interruptions in service will not materially adversely affect our operations in the future 
we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance and do not carry earthquake insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may be liable for our internet and television content 
as a publisher and a distributor of content over the internet and television  we also face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we publish or distribute 
such claims have been brought  and sometimes successfully pressed  against online services 
in addition  we could be exposed to liability with respect to material indexed or offered on our sites 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have security risks 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our internet operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
for example  so called spiders have and can be used in efforts to copy our databases  including our database of technology products and prices 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet  particularly as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
to the extent that activities of us or third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as computer software or credit card numbers  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
there can be no assurance that contractual provisions attempting to limit our liability in such areas will be successful or enforceable  or that other parties will accept such contractual provisions as part of our agreements 
we are dependent on licensed technology 
we rely on certain technology licensed from third parties  and there can be no assurance that these third party technology licenses will be available or will continue to be available to us on acceptable commercial terms or at all 
we have substantial indebtedness 
as a result of the sale of our convertible subordinated notes in march we incurred million of additional indebtedness 
along with the notes  we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on the notes make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations including our obligations under the notes 
we may be unable to pay our debt service and other obligations 
our operating income and cash flow generated during would have been insufficient to pay the amount of interest payable annually on our indebtedness  including our notes 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to pay interest and other amounts due on the notes or our other indebtedness 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in our indebtedness  we would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under our other indebtedness 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we face uncertainty relating to the year issue 
we are in the assessment phase of our year program 
we can offer no assurance that we will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or additional material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our internal systems  or by failures of our vendors partners to address their year issues in a timely and effective manner 
the price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuation 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations 
trading prices of our common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results announcements of innovations new products  strategic developments or business combinations by us or our competitors changes in our expected operating expense levels or losses changes in financial estimates and recommendations of securities analysts the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us news reports relating to trends in the internet 
other events or factors many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  prevent or make more difficult a merger  tender offer  proxy contest or change of control 
our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interest since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock 
among other things  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year permit directors to be removed only for cause specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations in addition  with certain exceptions  the delaware general corporation law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires or more of our voting stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if force to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held  information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less that 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in february  one of these investments in a privately held company became a marketable equity security when the investees completed an initial public offering 
such investment  which is in the internet industry  is subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and is recorded as long term investments
