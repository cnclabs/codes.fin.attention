vending revenue represents cash receipts from customers using vending machines and is recognized when collected 
the cost of vending revenue is comprised of the cost of vended products  location commissions  depreciation and direct service cost

product sold to the franchisees and non franchisee customers consists of goods to vend in shoppes 
equipment sales to the franchisees have been done on a pass through basis from the company s main suppliers 
the company anticipates that franchise and other revenue will increase in the future as a result of the sale of product to non franchisee customers

in  the decline in vending margin also resulted from a higher average shoppe commission rate paid to locations 
during the third quarter of  the company found it necessary to handle its own plush product warehousing in the seattle area due to increased product requirements and insufficient space available at the public warehouse previously used by the company

during such periods  accrued distributions on the trust preferred securities will compound quarterly and the company may not declare or pay distributions on its common stock or debt securities that rank equal or junior to the trust preferred securities 
issuance costs of approximately million related to the trust preferred securities are deferred and are being amortized over the period until mandatory redemption at september  approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the company s reducing revolving loan agreement the credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that cash will continue to be provided by operations as additional skill crane machines and other amusement devices are placed in service

the credit facility is available through july  and at december  there was a principal amount of approximately million outstanding and million available under the facility

the company was in compliance with such financial ratios and restrictions at december  the company may use a portion of its capital resources to effect acquisitions of franchisees

recent accounting pronouncement in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june  statement no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company has not yet adopted statement no 
the company believes the accounting and reporting standards required by this statement will not be significant 
the company will comply with the accounting and reporting requirements under this statement when required 
year compliance the year issue refers to the fact that certain management information systems use two digit date fields which recognize dates using the assumption that the first two digits are ie  the number is recognized as the year 
when the year occurs  these systems could interpret the year as versus  which in turn  could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to the company and its suppliers 
to address the issue  the company has established a compliance team that includes outside consulting staff 
the team has instituted a multi phase plan that includes inventorying all computer systems  software and business equipment to assess the impact of the year  obtaining documentation from each software vendor to ascertain their compliance  developing solution plans related to upgrading  modifying or replacing affected systems  and obtaining documentation from significant suppliers stating their year readiness 
the compliance team has determined that the company s critical operating systems  accounting systems  computer systems and business equipment are the major resources that are affected by the year issue 
while certain of these systems will need to be upgraded or replaced  the identified systems and or programs are primarily off the shelf products with year updates available 
the company expects to have these systems fully compliant by june  as part of its year plan  the company is in the process of contacting its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the systems of such suppliers are year compliant 
the company will continue to contact its suppliers in an effort to minimize any potential year compliance impact  however  it is not possible to guarantee the compliance of suppliers 
the total cost for the year plan has been and is expected to be minimal 
management believes that it has an effective plan in place to adequately address the year issue in a timely manner 
nevertheless  failure of third parties upon which the company s business relies could result in disruption of the company s supply of equipment and other general problems related to daily operations 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could adversely affect the company 
although  the company believes its year plan will adequately address the company s internal issues  the overall risks associated with the year issue cannot be fully identified until the company receives more responses from significant suppliers 
accordingly  the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements 
because such statements include risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and in the sections entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business as well as those discussed in this report and the company s prospectus dated september  growth and management of growth 
the company has recently experienced substantial growth 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow at historical rates or at all 
the company has completed acquisitions since january   including ten acquisitions since october  the company s ability to generate increased revenue and achieve higher levels of profitability will depend upon its ability and the ability of its franchisees to place additional shoppes in retail accounts as well as to maintain or increase the average financial performance of the shoppes 
the company s ability to place additional shoppes depends on a number of factors beyond the company s control  including general business and economic conditions 
installation of additional shoppes will also depend  in part  upon the company s ability to secure additional national and regional retail accounts and to obtain approval to place additional shoppes in individual locations of such accounts 
the company  its franchisees and their suppliers also may be unable to place and adequately service additional shoppes  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company has limited experience with product offerings beyond skill cranes  and new product offerings including kiddie rides  bulk vending  redemption equipment and video games may involve risks and operational requirements different from those of the shoppes 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that any additional company product offerings will meet with success or generate significant additional revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its expanding operations effectively or that it will be able to maintain or accelerate its growth 
the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on all aspects of the company s business  including shoppe servicing  merchandising  financial and administrative personnel and systems 
the company s future operating results are substantially dependent upon the ability of the company s officers and key personnel to manage anticipated growth and increased demand effectively  to attract  train and retain additional qualified personnel  and to implement and improve technical  service  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
either deterioration in shoppe performance or the company s failure to manage growth effectively could adversely and materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
shoppe performance 
the cash vending gross profit achieved during the fourth quarter of was  which is 
percentage points lower than the comparable period in the company attributes some of the shortfall to lower per week average shoppe revenue due to an ineffective product mix 
while the company has taken steps to address some of these problems  there can be no assurance that such efforts will have a positive impact on the performance of the shoppes 
the average weekly revenue generated per shoppe may continue to decline or fluctuate in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial indebtedness  effect of financial leverage 
the company intends to use funds available under the credit facility million at december  for a number of purposes  including future acquisitions of franchisees 
further use of funds from the credit facility could result in the company incurring additional indebtedness that is substantial in relation to its stockholders equity and cash flow 
as a result of the issuance of the subordinated debentures and the amount the company owes pursuant to the credit facility  fixed charges could exceed earnings for the foreseeable future 
substantial leverage poses the risk that the company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its indebtedness  or to adequately fund its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase its revenue and leverage the acquisitions it has made to achieve sufficient cash flow to meet its potential debt service obligations 
in particular  there can be no assurance that the company s operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its debt service obligations under the credit facility 
the company s leverage also could limit its ability to effect future financings or may otherwise restrict the company s operations and growth 
integration of acquisitions 
the company has recently completed a number of acquisitions and intends to continue to acquire franchisees in the future 
acquisitions have placed  and are likely to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s managerial  operating  financial and other resources 
the company s future performance will depend  in part  upon its ability to integrate its acquisitions effectively  which will require that the company implement additional management information systems capabilities  further develop its operating  administrative and financial and accounting systems and controls  improve coordination among accounting  finance  marketing and operations  and hire and train additional personnel 
failure by the company to develop adequate operational and control systems or to attract and retain additional qualified management  financial  sales and marketing and customer care personnel could materially adversely affect the company s ability to integrate the businesses it has acquired and continues to acquire 
while the company anticipates that it will recognize various economies and efficiencies of scale as a result of its acquisitions and the integration of the businesses it has acquired  the process of consolidating the businesses and implementing integrations  even if successful  may take a significant period of time  will place a significant strain on the company s resources and could subject the company to additional expenses during the integration process 
furthermore  the company s performance will depend on the internal growth generated through acquired operations 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate the businesses it has acquired successfully or in a timely manner in accordance with its strategic objectives 
failure to effectively and efficiently integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trade relations and dependence on major accounts 
the company s largest account  wal mart  accounted for approximately of total revenue in the company has entered into a contract with wal mart which expires on january   generally national and regional retail accounts enter into long term contracts with vendors 
in individual location accounts  the company and its franchisees generally place shoppes pursuant to oral agreements with location managers 
the arrangements of the company and its franchisees with most of these accounts may be terminated at any time 
in addition  wal mart may terminate its contract with the company under certain limited circumstances 
the loss of the wal mart account  or the loss of a significant number of other major accounts  or a significant reduction in the number of shoppes placed at such accounts  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the company competes with a number of regional and local operators of skill crane machines 
many of these competitors are engaged in aggressive expansion programs  and the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience intense competition for new locations and acquisition candidates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with these companies in the future 
the company s shoppes also compete with other vending machines and coin operated amusement devices and seasonal and bulk merchandise for sites within retail locations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its current sites in the retail locations or that it will be able to obtain sites in the future on attractive terms or at all 
there also are few barriers to entry in the company s business  and it would be possible for well financed vending machine manufacturers or other vending machine operators with existing relationships with retail accounts targeted by the company to compete readily with the company in certain markets 
dependence on suppliers and foreign sourcing 
substantially all of the plush toys and other products dispensed from the shoppes are produced by foreign manufacturers 
a majority are purchased directly by the company from manufacturers in china 
the company purchases its other products indirectly from vendors who obtain a significant percentage of such products from foreign manufacturers 
as a result  the company is subject to changes in governmental policies  the imposition of tariffs  import and export controls  transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions and labor strikes which could disrupt the supply of products from such manufacturers 
among other things  the loss of china s most favored nation status under us tariff laws could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of certain products manufactured in china  which could result in substantially increased costs for certain products purchased by the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also could be affected by labor strikes in the sea shipping  trucking and railroad industries  all of which the company utilizes to varying degrees 
although the company believes that alternative means of transportation would be available for its products in the event of a labor strike affecting a particular mode of transportation  such a disruption could increase the company s transportation costs and thereby reduce its profit margins in a particular period 
the company does not have a long term supply agreement with any of its crane suppliers 
while the company believes that it will continue to be able to purchase skill crane machines from existing or alternative suppliers  no assurance can be given that skill cranes will be available on a cost efficient basis or that shortages or other disruptions in the company s sources of supply for skill crane machines and components would not have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonality and variability of results 
the financial performance of the shoppes is substantially dependent on the level of retail traffic at such shoppes particular location 
accordingly  the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company can be materially and adversely affected by factors which reduce retail traffic at shoppe locations 
these include numerous factors beyond the company s control such as weather  labor strikes and other disruptions of the business at retail accounts and local and national business and economic conditions 
the company s results are also linked to seasonal increases in foot traffic at retail accounts  and disruptions of past trends  including traditional increases during holiday seasons  could decrease the company s revenue 
as a result  the company s operating results may vary significantly over time 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and the company s past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
changing consumer trends  technological innovations 
consumer preferences are constantly changing and difficult to predict  and consumer interest in the company s shoppes or the products dispensed could decline suddenly or other prize dispensing equipment or amusement devices could replace the shoppes in consumer preference 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to offer new and appealing products and on the continuing appeal of its shoppes skill crane format in both existing markets and in new markets into which the company may expand 
there can be no assurance that the use of skill crane machines and the company s operating results will not be adversely affected by changing consumer trends 
the company s business also is susceptible to advances in the design and manufacture of skill crane machines and other vending technology 
the company s failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such technological changes could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
dependence on key employees 
the company s success to date has been dependent in part upon the efforts and abilities of jerome m 
lapin its president  chief executive officer and chairman  w 
john cash its vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  randall j 
fagundo its chief operating officer and secretary  abbe m 
stutsman its vice president of purchasing and product development and certain other key personnel 
the company s continued success will depend upon its ability to retain a number of its current key employees and to attract  train and retain new key management and operational personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its existing key employees or attract and retain qualified employees in the future 
the company does not maintain any key man insurance 
in addition  executives or other employees with knowledge of the company s operations and policies may leave the company and establish competitive businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to effectively enforce non compete provisions against these individuals
