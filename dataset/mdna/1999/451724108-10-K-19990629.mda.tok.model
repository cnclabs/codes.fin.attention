overview pentegra provides practice management services to fee for service dental practices in the united states 
on march   pentegra acquired simultaneously with the closing of its initial public offering ipo  substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets  and assumed the liabilities  of affiliated practices 
pentegra also began to provide practice management services to professional corporations or associations owned by the dentist owners of those affiliated practices one of which split into two separate dental practices immediately after the ipo pursuant to long term management service agreements entered into at the time of the ipo 
throughout fiscal  pentegra added affiliate practices

on september   the company filed a registration statement on form s for  shares of common stock  and  in convertible subordinated debt securities  which the company may issue from time to time in connection with the direct and indirect acquisitions of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
the terms upon which it issues the shares and convertible subordinated debt securities are determined through negotiations of the businesses whose securities or assets are to be acquired 
the shares of common stock that are issued are valued at market prices 
persons receiving common stock in connection with such acquisitions may be contractually required to hold all or some portion of the common stock for varying periods of time 
the convertible subordinated debt securities will be convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock  at any time on or after their convertibility commencement date  and at or before maturity  unless previously redeemed at their conversion price 
the convertible subordinated debt securities will be i unsecured and ii subordinate to all present and future senior indebtedness of pentegra and iii effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of subsidiaries of pentegra

as of march    shares and  aggregate principal amount or convertible subordinated notes registered under these filings had been issued 
year issue a number of computer programs and other equipment with embedded chips or processors systems use two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any systems that are date sensitive may recognize a date of as the year rather than the year this could result in miscalculations or system failures causing disruptions of operations  as well as potentially exposing pentegra to third party liability 
this issue is commonly referred to as the year problem yk 
pentegra has initiated a yk compliance program to ensure that all of the critical systems and processes that are under its direct control remain functional 
pentegra completed the installation of year compliant software for its operations prior to the ipo 
accordingly pentegra does not expect the year issue to have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
although pentegra s yk compliance program will attempt to determine the yk readiness of key third parties  there may be certain systems or processes relied on by pentegra that are outside of its control  and there can be no assurance that these systems or processes will remain functional 
non compliance by key third parties could have a material adverse effect on the operations of pentegra 
to date  the costs incurred by pentegra that relate solely to the yk compliance program have been minimal 
in the opinion of management  the costs to complete pentegra s yk compliance program will not have a material adverse effect on pentegra s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
pentegra has received assurance that the systems implemented prior to the ipo are yk compliant 
in addition  pentegra has inventoried all hardware and software at the affiliated practices that process information related to practice management 
pentegra has estimated it will incur approximately  in computer upgrades for yk compliance 
these upgrades are estimated to be completed by september the failure to correct a material year problem could possibly result in an interruption in or failure of  certain normal business activities operations 
such failure would materially and adversely affect pentegra s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  including uncertainty regarding the year readiness of third party suppliers and potential future acquisitions  pentegra is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of any possible year failures will have a material adverse impact on pentegra s financial position  results or operations and cash flows 
pentegra believes that  with the scheduled completion of its computer system upgrades  the possibility of any material interruption to normal operations should be significantly reduced 
pentegra s plans to comply with year requirements and completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
there can be no assurances  however  that the estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those estimates 
specific factors that might cause such material difference include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to identify and correct potential problems and similar uncertainties 
contingency plans if during the course of the company s assessments of its critical systems if it is determined that the risk of yk disruptions is significant  contingency plans will be developed as appropriate 
such plans might include the use of alternative service providers or product suppliers should they incur significant yk issues 
currently  the company does not have any contingency plans in place based on current yk readiness assessments
