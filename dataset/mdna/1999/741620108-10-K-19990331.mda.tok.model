item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was incorporated in january since its inception  primix has helped organizations build applications that integrate and extend disparate information systems 
in the past  primix focused on developing and marketing its application development products  along with implementation services 
during  there was a change in control of the company 
avix ventures  lp avix purchased a majority interest in the company from a group of the company s principal shareholders 
two senior executives resigned  and lennart mengwall  a principal at avix with years of experience in the information technology industry  was thereafter appointed the new chairman and  subsequently  chief executive officer of the company 
new management immediately undertook a comprehensive review of the company s strategy and operations 
as a result of this review  the company took steps to reduce expenses  including reducing primix s workforce by approximately 
at the same time  the company was re organized into two distinct business units the consulting services group csg and the software products group spg 
the company believed that a re organization into two separate business units would allow each business to focus on its core competencies 
during the first quarter of  the company unified its software products and consulting services business units into a single consulting services organization focused on delivering e business solutions 
e business encompasses a wide variety of business processes in which internet technologies are used to more effectively manage relationships between customers  vendors  suppliers  distributors and employees  and thereby increase sales  reduce costs  improve productivity and or promote customer loyalty 
companies wishing to leverage the potential of e business often face a mix of strategic  technical  and creative challenges for which they require outsourced services 
in competing to deliver those services  large  well established professional services firms such as management consultancies  systems integrators and advertising agencies face great operational and cultural challenges in trying to address the unique inter disciplinary requirements of such projects 
by contrast  primix was at the optimal stage of development by the end of to begin to narrow its focus on the e business opportunity 
having made strategic investments in developing the company s fixed time fixed price delivery methodology  corporate identity  consulting  and sales organizations  primix added executives with deep experience in cross media brand development  web site design  and strategic and business process consulting to its management team during the first quarter of this expertise which added to the company s established strength in e business consulting  systems integration and solution development  has allowed the company to build a balanced approach to strategy  design and technology on a foundation of technical excellence 
on december   primix acquired advis  inc  a privately held boston based e business consulting company  which augmented the depth and breadth of the company s capabilities in developing highly advanced systems architectures that support e business solutions 
in addition to adding approximately highly skilled technical consultants  the advis acquisition brought valuable existing customer relationships 
primix now brings together o the strategic insight of a management consulting firm o the creative talent and graphic design expertise of an advertising agency  and o the technical depth of a systems integrator to help clients define  develop and deploy e business solutions that deliver real business results 
as a result of the company s significant transition during  management can not currently anticipate future revenue levels 
however  management does anticipate incurring significant expenses as the company continues to grow its sales  creative  strategy and consulting staff 
the company has a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of the company and its prospects 
the company and its prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets and technologies 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  grow the consulting business  respond to competitive developments  successfully adjust the company s strategy to changes in the marketplace  identify channels for the company s services  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified management and other employees  and remain knowledgeable with new and emerging technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing such risks 
the company has achieved only limited revenues to date and its ability to generate significant revenues is subject to substantial uncertainty 
the limited operating history of the company makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult and therefore  there can be no assurance that the company will sustain revenue growth or achieve profitability 
the company has incurred net losses since inception and expects to continue to incur losses on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock may be materially adversely affected
