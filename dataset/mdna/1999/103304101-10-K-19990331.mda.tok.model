the company may discover year issues in the course of its evaluation processes in phases one or two  or issues may not be detected  that would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
phase three of the process involves the implementation of remediation plans for it and non it systems that were identified in phase one and two as non compliant 
this process is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of and will involve either the replacement of the company s existing systems with systems that are year compliant or the remedial review and replacement of the software code with code that does not use the two digit year code 
as part of this phase  the company intends to perform date sensitive testing including testing on systems that vendors have certified to be year compliant  to ensure that the modifications developed adequately resolve the year issue 
while the company believes the testing program should provide additional evidence of its ability to operate in the year  the company may discover year issues in the course of its testing process  or issues may not be detected  that would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
phase four  expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of  involves evaluating year compliance for those vendors who provide the company with goods and services critical to the servicing of our guests  mainly in the non gaming portions of our business 
while no individual vendor supplies the company with a significant portion of the goods or services used in the non gaming operations  the company may discover year issues in the course of evaluation of its vendors  or issues may not be detected  that would have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the final phase of the process  expected to be completed during the third quarter of  will involve the development of a contingency plan in the event any non compliant critical systems remain by january  as part of this phase  the company will attempt to quantify the impact  if any  of the failure to complete any necessary corrective action 
the company currently believes that the majority of the equipment and processes used by the company have adequate manual backup procedures that would allow the company to continue to operate a significant portion of the business in the event the conversion project is not completed on schedule or the systems of other companies on which the company may rely are not timely converted 
however  in most of the central region gaming jurisdictions  electronic monitoring of operations is required 
waivers for manual processes may be obtained from these gaming jurisdictions  however  there can be no assurance that a material portion of the gaming business at those properties would not be affected until the time at which a waiver is granted or if a waiver is granted at all 
if the company is able to obtain timely waivers for the central region properties  the remaining primary risks associated with the year may be an effect on the timing of the reporting of certain operating results to management and may include an adverse effect on business volumes if the year problems could not be timely corrected 
although the company cannot currently estimate the magnitude of such impact  if systems material to the company s operations have not been made year compliant upon completion of this phase  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
the company recently reevaluated its estimates and assumptions of the costs directly associated with the year project and currently estimates approximately million in costs directly associated with the project that is expected to be funded from cash flow from operations and availability under the company s bank credit facility 
this current estimate includes approximately million in operating expenses related to the remediation efforts  including training 
at december   the company had incurred approximately million in costs directly related to the year project  substantially all of which were capitalized as they related to replacement of systems that were not year compliant 
given the inherent risks for a project of this magnitude and the resources required  the timing and costs involved could differ materially from those anticipated by the company 
there can be no assurance that the year project will be completed on schedule or within budget

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
to reduce such risks  the company selectively uses financial instruments for its floating rate debt 
on december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million 
the agreement calls for the company to swap its variable libor rate at december  for a fixed libor rate of 
the variable libor rate readjusts each quarter and the agreement is cancelable should the libor rate exceed 
the swap agreement terminates in december the fair value of the swap liability at december  is approximately  based on the present value of future cash outflows expected from the company based on the libor rate at december  the company also has certain fixed rate debt which it believes to have a fair value that approximates its reported amounts 
the company believes that the market risk arising from these financial instruments is not material
