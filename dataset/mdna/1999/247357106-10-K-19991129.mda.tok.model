item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview increased sales of the company s transgenic cotton varieties containing the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  or both  to of total unit sales coupled with increased sales in australia and china are the major reasons that d pl reported record sales of million up from million in the company sold in the us sufficient quantities of seed containing the transgenic traits to plant approximately million acres in versus approximately million acres in domestic upland cotton acreage increased to million acres in from million acres in even though cotton prices were at recent record lows 
since the prices of crops that compete for the cotton acreage in d pl s primary territory corn and soybeans were also lower  cotton acreage was favorably affected 
soybean unit sales  although greater than levels  were significantly one third lower than forecast 
since soybeans do not carry over from year to year  the inventory purchased to meet the demand that did not materialize was written down to net realizable value at year end 
cottonseed sales by the company s joint venture in china nearly doubled in over levels 
the venture sold enough seed to plant over  acres up from  acres in in addition  the company s australian subsidiary s sales doubled due to the sale of transgenic products and  as a result  reported its first ever operating profit which reduced the pretax operating loss from all international operations to million in from million in due to the uncertainty by the company of planted acres in  and the company s uncertainty of the rate at which farmers would continue to plant transgenic products compared to conventional products  the company purchased additional quantities of seed to ensure that it had an adequate supply of seed of both conventional and transgenic varieties to meet demand by its farmer customers 
the accelerated shift to transgenic cottonseed products which complicates inventory management and product line design  coupled with significantly less than expected soybean sales  resulted in the company recording inventory write offs of million in excess of normal levels 
such excess portion is separately stated as a component of cost of sales 
in july  the company announced the consolidation of the three divisional sales and marketing staffs and three divisional technical services staffs into one corporate wide sales and marketing team and one corporate wide technical services team that will serve the three brands deltapine  suregrow  and paymaster 
approximately forty salaried positions were eliminated which generated severance pay and relocation costs of approximately million which were recorded as special charges 
future savings are expected to be million annually 
the three divisional research programs were combined into a single company wide program  and two new research programs were launched in the company s effort to invest its resources where it believes it has the best opportunity for developing new products for commercial introduction 
in  the company recorded special and nonrecurring pretax charges of  that relate to additional inventory reserves and  to a lesser degree  costs related to the evaluation of various strategic alternatives which ultimately resulted in the company entering into the merger agreement with monsanto 
the unprecedented level of inventory reserves and write offs were a result of excess inventory quantities resulting from a reduction in acreage and the realignment of the company s product line 
furthermore  the company s domestic market share declined which the company believes resulted from the second quarter recall of certain varieties that did not meet quality standards that contained both the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
the accelerated shift to transgenic products significantly complicates inventory management and product line design and will require continued dedicated efforts to effectively manage the company s changing product line 
the costs related to the merger are primarily fees for legal advice  investment bankers and other professionals 
in  d pl announced a program to optimize production cost and operating efficiencies which included the idling of three of its less efficient delinting plants  the write down of assets whose value has been impaired as a result of implementing the plan  plant consolidation costs relating to implementation of a new process manufacturing system and costs to phase out certain products 
the company reduced its existing domestic work force as a result of the plant closings and by offering an early retirement program to all employees who met certain criteria 
net sales and licensing fees in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
the increase is primarily the result of a increased sales of upland picker cottonseed varieties that contain either or both of the bollgard and roundup ready genes  b increased sales of roundup ready soybeans and c record sales reported by the australian subsidiary and the joint venture in china 
in  transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in roundup ready soybean units comprised approximately of total units sold in compared to in international sales increased to million in from million in due to sales increases in australia and china which resulted in both entities reporting profits in the effects of these increases were partially offset by a decline in export sales to mexico which was caused by a reduction in planted cotton acreage due to inclement weather and lower commodity prices 
in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
the increase is primarily the result of a increased sales of stripper cottonseed containing monsanto s roundup ready gene b increased sales of picker cottonseed containing both the bollgard and roundup ready genes  and c the commercial introduction of soybean seed containing monsanto s roundup ready gene 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of picker cottonseed varieties resulting from inclement weather during the planting season and commodity prices 
the usda estimated that the planted cotton acreage approximated million acres in subsequently revised to million which is a decrease from cotton acres planted of million 
soybean unit sales increased over due to increased planted soybean acres and market share gains by the company s varieties 
in  the company and monsanto changed the method used to calculate the acres to be used for billing purposes for the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
in prior years  the farmers were billed based on their stated planting rates  which  if within a prescribed range for a particular geographic territory  were used for purposes of calculating the number of licensed acres and therefore billable acres 
in  assumed planting rates were established by d pl and monsanto for seven specific territories and farmers were billed for the number of acres that could be planted for each bag of seed sold  using the predetermined territorial formula 
in  total transgenic seed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to in roundup ready soybean units comprised of total units sold in versus less than in international sales including exports increased in to million from million in  primarily from the initial sales derived from hebei jai dai  the joint venture in shiujiazhuang  hebei  people s republic of china 
gross profit d pl s consolidated gross profit after special cotton and soybean seed inventory write offs of million was million in compared to million in special pretax charges of million were recorded in that relate to the write off of excess cottonseed and soybean seed 
the cottonseed was purchased to ensure that d pl had ample supplies of both conventional and transgenic cottonseed varieties since management was uncertain of the ultimate sales mix for the season 
commodity prices of corn  cotton and soybeans  and their impact on farmer planting decisions  the increased flexibility of planting decisions by farmers afforded by the freedom to farm act  coupled with wide scale availability in of cottonseed of varieties that contained both the bollgard and roundup ready genes which were available only in limited quantities and varieties in as well as the introduction of new varieties  made forecasting with any degree of certainty difficult 
the company wanted to be prepared to meet farmer demand and purchased additional seed in to ensure it had adequate supplies of both conventional and transgenic varieties 
soybean seed sales were one third less than planned for  and the resultant excess inventory approximately million was written off at year end 
the product line of both cotton and soybeans continue to realign to those varieties with transgenic traits 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales before special inventory charges was in compared to in the decline is attributable to increased sales of transgenic cottonseed varieties which carry a lower gross margin compared to conventional varieties since the company s gross margin on technology fees approximates 
d pl s consolidated gross profit after special and nonrecurring charges was million in compared to million in special pretax charges of approximately million were recorded in that relate to a additional inventory reserves established to provide for excess inventory resulting from a reduction in planted cotton acres in and the further realignment of the company s product line to seed with new technologies  and b a recall of certain products that did not meet the company s quality standards 
gross margin expressed as a percentage of sales before the special charges was consistent between and at 
operating expenses operating expenses before special charges increased to million in from million in due in part to international joint ventures 
recurring operating expenses are expected to remain consistent in with levels 
special charges related to severance pay and benefits of million resulting from the elimination of the divisional sales and marketing and divisional technical services staffs  and costs associated with the merger with monsanto which approximated million  are included as operating expenses 
these charges are in addition to the inventory write offs noted earlier which are recorded as cost of sales 
in  the company s total operating expenses increased  as planned  to million before special charges  from million before special charges in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased transgenic seed development activities  additional variety trials and seed testing and increased cotton research activities in argentina  australia  brazil  china  greece  and spain 
the company expects further increases in research and development expenses in since it plans to start two new domestic cotton breeding programs 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of additional transgenic costs associated with development and evaluation of new technologies  transformation of the company s product line and collaboration with outside research providers 
selling expenses selling expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is related to higher fees paid to the california department of food and agriculture on seed sales  sales and marketing activities by the company s joint ventures in argentina and brazil  increased advertising  and the costs associated with an incentive program designed to promote the sale of transgenic seed 
selling expenses increased in to million from in the increase was primarily due to an aggressive advertising and promotional program and expansion of international sales and marketing in china 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase relates to expenses related to operations in argentina and brazil and higher legal fees associated with non us patents  trademark and variety registrations 
general and administrative expenses were essentially flat between and special charges and unusual charges related to acquisitions the company incurred approximately million in costs related to the planned merger with monsanto 
such costs are primarily legal and professional fees and reserves established for losses on the planned disposition of certain assets that may be necessary to close the merger with monsanto 
the company also paid severance and related benefits of approximately million to approximately forty employees who were terminated in august  in connection with the reorganization of the sales and marketing and technical services departments 
in connection with the evaluation and pursuit of various strategic alternatives and ultimately the planned merger with monsanto see item  the company incurred  in  approximately million associated with legal  investment banker and other professional fees 
in connection with the production and cost optimization program  the company recorded or special charge of million of which million was included in cost of sales and million was included in operating expenses 
these charges include costs associated with the plan to optimize operating efficiencies  plant consolidation costs  costs to phase out certain products  the write down of assets whose value has been impaired as a result of the plan and  to a lesser extent  severance costs 
in connection with the merger with the sure grow companies  the company recorded approximately million during fiscal for costs associated with this transaction including legal costs incurred in connection with the u 
s 
department of justice s review of that transaction 
interest expense interest expense net of interest income increased to million in from million in which was attributable to higher bank fees and lower capitalized interest 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings throughout the year used to finance international ventures and higher inventory levels  the effects of which were partially offset by lower interest rates 
other income expense in  the company recorded losses on the disposition of fixed assets and other non recurring charges of million 
in and  other income expense included primarily gains on sales of fixed assets and accounts payable discounts received for early payments 
net income and earnings per share net income applicable to common shares increased to million in from million in and million in net income per share diluted after special and nonrecurring charges was  and in  and  respectively 
net income per share diluted before special and nonrecurring charges was  and in  and  respectively 
the number of shares deemed outstanding was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
the company maintains credit facilities  uses early payments by customers and uses cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
for more than years d pl has borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
in the united states  d pl purchases seed from contract growers in its first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal borrowings normally commence in the first fiscal quarter and peak in the third fiscal quarter 
loan repayments normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
d pl also offers customers financial incentives to make early payments 
in fiscal  d pl received approximately million in early payments 
to the extent d pl attracts early payments from customers  bank borrowings under the credit facility are reduced 
the company records receivables for licensing fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales as the seed is shipped  usually in the company s second and third quarters 
the company has contracted the billing and collection activities for bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees to monsanto 
in september  the technology fees are due at which time d pl receives payment from monsanto 
d pl then pays monsanto its royalty for the bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees 
in april  the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with its existing lender and two other financial institutions which provides for aggregate borrowings of million 
this agreement provides a base commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
the base commitment is a long term loan that may be borrowed upon at any time and is due april  the seasonal commitment is a working capital loan that may be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year and expires april  each commitment offers variable and fixed interest rate options and requires the company to pay facility or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
at august   the company had million available for borrowing under the base commitment 
in addition the lead lender has approved a million credit line that can be activated by the company as needed 
on april   the company activated the previously approved million additional seasonal credit facility 
such facility was available from april  to september  and incurred interest at rates comparable to the existing facility 
the financial covenants under the loan agreements require the company to a maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at august  of less than or equal to to to at the company s other quarter ends b maintain a fixed charge ratio at the end of each quarter greater than or equal to to and c maintain at all times tangible net worth of not less than the sum of i million plus ii of net income but not losses determined on the last day of each fiscal year  commencing with august  at august  and the company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth exceeded the permitted ratio 
the financial institutions waived compliance with this covenant 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that domestic capital expenditures will approximate million in  excluding expected capital expenditures for foreign joint ventures which will be funded by cash from operations  borrowings or investments from joint venture partners  as necessary 
capital expenditures in for international ventures are expected to range from million to million depending on the timing and outcome of such projects 
cash provided from operations  early payments from customers and borrowings under the loan agreement should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  existing products  technical developments  new products  research and development activities  preparation for year issues  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include those noted elsewhere in this item and filing and the following d pl s contemplated merger with monsanto is subject to approval by the united states department of justice antitrust division 
the inability to complete this merger may have a material effect on the company 
however  such effect is not known at this time 
demand for d pl s seed will be affected by government programs and policies and  most importantly  by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive  and d pl varieties face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products and new technologies that may compete with the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
the company s seed products and technologies contained therein may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of the company s competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the production  distribution or sale of crop seed in or to foreign markets may be subject to special risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rate controls  expropriation  nationalization and other agricultural  economic  tax and regulatory policies of foreign governments 
particular policies which may affect the domestic and international operations of d pl include the use of and the acceptance of products that were produced from plants that were genetically modified  the testing  quarantine and other restrictions relating to the import and export of plants and seed products and the availability or lack thereof of proprietary protection for plant products 
in addition  united states government policies  particularly those affecting foreign trade and investment  may impact the company s international operations 
the recent publicity related to genetically modified organisms gmo s or products made from plants that contain gmo s may have an effect on the company s sales in the future 
in  approximately of the company s cottonseed that was sold contained either the bollgard  roundup ready  or both gene technologies and of the company s soybean seed sales contained the roundup ready gene technology 
although many farmers have rapidly adopted these technologies  the alleged concern over finished products that contain gmo s could impact demand for crops raised from seed containing such traits 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which the company operates and because of factors within the particular international markets targeted by the company  international profitability and growth may be less stable and predictable than domestic profitability and growth 
overall profitability will depend on the factors noted above as well as weather conditions  government policies in all countries where the company sells products and operates  worldwide commodity prices  the company s ability to successfully open new international markets  the company s ability to successfully continue the development of the high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and the company are working and the company s ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability
