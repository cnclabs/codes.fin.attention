 disclosures about segments of a business enterprise  the company was organized into two primary segments  the california and national business segments  during the year ended december  effective april   the company intends to modify its internal business operations 
it is anticipated that the impact of this internal change will also affect the disclosures of the company s segments from that presented as of december  the company is currently evaluating the effect of this proposed change and expects that future filings under the securities exchange act of on or after the effective date of this reorganization will reflect such modified segments 
sale of workers compensation segment on july   wellpoint entered into a stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement by and between wellpoint and fremont indemnity company fremont 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  fremont acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of unicare specialty services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of wellpoint unicare specialty 
the transaction was completed on september  the principal asset of unicare specialty was the capital stock of unicare workers compensation insurance company unicare workers compensation 
the purchase price for the acquisition was the statutory surplus adjusted in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement of unicare workers compensation as of the date of the closing 
the purchase price based upon adjusted statutory surplus of unicare workers compensation as of september   the closing date of the transaction  was approximately million 
subsequent to september   the company and fremont are jointly marketing integrated workers compensation and medical insurance products in the small employer group market 
national expansion and other recent developments in an effort to pursue the expansion of the company s national business segment  during the past three years the company has completed the acquisition of two businesses outside the state of california  the life and health benefits management division mmhd of massachusetts mutual life insurance company and the group benefits operations the gbo of john hancock mutual life insurance company 
the purchase method of accounting has been used to account for both of the aforementioned transactions 
the excess purchase price over net assets acquired was approximately million for the gbo and million for mmhd 
during the fourth quarter of  the company re evaluated the useful life of the intangible assets and goodwill related to these acquisitions and reduced such composite lives from to years 
the company s pending transaction with cerulean companies  inc is also a component of this expansion 
on march   the company completed its acquisition of the gbo 
the purchase price was million  subject to the resolution of certain items related to the post closing audit 
the purchase method of accounting has been used to account for the acquisition of the gbo 
the gbo  with an associated million acquired members  targets large employers with  or more employees and a majority of the medical members it serves are in health plans that are self funded by employers 
as a result of the gbo and mmhd acquisitions  the company has significantly expanded its operations outside of california 
in order to integrate its acquired businesses and implement the company s regional expansion strategy  the company will need to develop satisfactory provider and sales networks and successfully convert these books of business to the company s existing information systems  which will require additional expenditures by the company 
on may   the company completed the recapitalization  including the acquisition of the commercial operations of bcc the bcc commercial operations for million in cash 
the recapitalization included the payment of a million special dividend funded by million in revolving debt and the remainder in cash 
in september  the company received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service with respect to the treatment of certain payments in conjunction with the recapitalization and acquisition of the bcc commercial operations 
the ruling allows the company to deduct as an ordinary and necessary business expense an million cash payment made by blue cross of california in may to one of two newly formed charitable foundations 
as a result of such private letter ruling  the company reduced the remaining intangible asset related to its acquisition of the bcc commercial operations to zero 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has acquired certain businesses over the last three years which historically experienced a higher overall loss ratio than the company 
these acquired businesses have contributed to an increase in the company s overall loss ratio 
in order to control the respective loss ratios and reduce the financial risk of these acquired businesses  the company has undertaken a variety of measures  including significant premium increases and changes in product design 
the gbo and mmhd businesses have historically also experienced a higher administrative expense ratio than the company s traditional california business due to the higher percentage of management services business 
these higher administrative expense ratios have contributed to an increase in the company s overall administrative expense ratio since the respective dates of acquisition 
pending acquisition of cerulean on july   the company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with cerulean companies inc cerulean see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cerulean  principally through its blue cross blue shield of georgia subsidiary  offers insured and administrative services products primarily in the state of georgia 
cerulean has historically experienced a higher administrative expense ratio than the company s core businesses due to its higher concentration of administrative services business 
cerulean has also historically experienced a higher loss ratio than the company s core businesses due to its higher percentage of large group business  which generally reduces the company s overall risk and also underwriting margins 
accordingly  it is expected that cerulean s higher loss and administrative expense ratios will ultimately contribute to an increase in those ratios for the company after the transaction is completed 
this transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of legislation a variety of health care reform measures are currently pending or have been recently enacted at the federal  state and local levels 
federal legislation enacted during the last two years seeks  among other things  to insure the portability of health coverage and mandates minimum maternity hospital stays 
these and other proposed measures may have the effect of dramatically altering the regulation of health care and of increasing the company s loss ratio or decreasing the affordability of the company s products 
in may  the texas legislature adopted senate bill no 
sb 
among other things  this legislation purports to make managed care organizations mcos such as the company liable for the failure by the mco  its employees or agents to exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions as defined in sb 
the legislation was effective as of september  in september  the united states district court for the southern district of texas ruled  in part  that the mco liability provisions of sb are not preempted by the federal employee retirement income security act of erisa 
to date  this legislation has not adversely affected the company s results of operations 
similar legislation is currently pending in both the california and georgia legislatures 
although the company maintains insurance covering such liabilities  to the extent that this legislation or similar legislation that may be subsequently adopted at the federal or state level effectively expands the scope of liability of mcos such as the company  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
even if the company is not held to be liable under any litigation  the existence of potential mco liability may cause the company to incur greater costs in defending such litigation 
year the company is substantially dependent on its computer systems  business applications and other information technology systems it systems  due to the nature of its managed health care business and the increasing number of electronic transactions in the industry 
historically  many it systems were developed to recognize the year as a two digit number  with the digits being recognized as the year the year presents a number of potential problems for such systems  including potentially significant processing errors or failure 
given the company s reliance on its computer systems  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any significant errors or failures 
additionally  the year presents potential problems for other systems and applications containing date dependent embedded microprocessors non it systems  such as elevators and heating and ventilation equipment 
the company has developed and is in the midst of executing a comprehensive plan designed to address the year issue for its it and non it systems and applications 
with respect to it systems  during the company completed a detailed risk assessment of its various computer systems  business applications and other affected systems  formulated a plan for specific remediation efforts and began certain of such remediation efforts 
during and the first quarter of  the company completed its remediation efforts and undertook internal testing of its systems and applications 
in the second quarter of  the company expects to undergo third party review of certain of its year remediation efforts 
this third party review will include an assessment of the procedures undertaken by the company as well as a computer software test of selected portions of the company s computer code 
with respect to non it systems  the company is currently in the process of completing the replacement or renovation of company owned systems to address year issues 
the company is also undertaking a review of non it systems in leased facilities and  where appropriate  obtaining certifications from the property owners that non it systems in leased facilities will be remediated or replaced on a timely basis 
the company currently expects that its year remediation efforts and third party review with respect to non it systems will be completed by the second quarter of the company currently estimates that its costs related to year compliance remediation for company owned it systems and applications will be approximately to million in the amounts expected to be expended during represent less than of the company s it systems budget 
during the year ended december   the company expended approximately million and million for remediation of its it software systems and applications and for renovation or replacement of its telecommunications equipment  respectively 
the company currently estimates that its total costs in with respect to non it systems and applications will be approximately million 
the company s expenditures with respect to non it systems will include the acquisition of back up power supplies for the company s headquarters and data center facilities 
the company expenses year remediation costs as incurred and expects to fund these costs through cash flow from operations 
while the immediacy of year compliance measures has caused the company to defer or cancel certain it projects  the company does not expect such actions to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
assuming the company s pending acquisition of cerulean is consummated see note to the consolidated financial statements  similar remediation and testing efforts with respect to cerulean owned it and non it systems and applications may increase the company s total expenditures 
the company is currently formulating detailed contingency plans in the event that its various systems and applications do not achieve year compliance in a timely fashion 
the contingency plans are focused on identifying potential failure scenarios for the company s it and non it systems and those of third parties with which the company interacts and on ensuring the continuation of critical business operations 
during the first half of  the company expects to integrate each of these contingency plans into a company wide contingency plan 
the company continues to assemble survey data from health care transaction clearing houses  third party vendors and certain other parties with which the company communicates electronically to determine the compliance efforts being undertaken by these parties and to assess the company s potential business exposure to any non compliant systems operated by these parties 
health care claims submitted electronically to the company are usually submitted through clearing houses on behalf of health care providers 
based on the survey data and other information compiled by the company to date  the company has not identified any third parties that the company expects will suffer year related problems which are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the company s operations 
however  many of these third parties are currently in the process of implementing the critical portions of their own year compliance measures 
as a result  at the current time the company does not have sufficient information to determine whether its external relationships will be materially adversely affected by year compliance problems 
if the company s year issues were not completely resolved prior to the end of  the company could be subject to a number of potential consequences  including  among other things  an inability to timely and accurately process health care claims  collect customers premiums or administrative fees  verify subscriber eligibility  assess utilization trends or compile accurate financial data for use by management 
in particular  the company may experience a decrease in electronic health claims submission  which could cause the company s claims inventory to increase on a temporary basis 
an increase in claims inventory could prevent the company from identifying emerging utilization trends quickly and taking appropriate actions to mitigate such trends through pricing actions  benefit redesign or other actions 
the company is attempting to limit its exposure to year issues by closely monitoring its own year remediation efforts  assessing the year compliance efforts of various third parties with which it interacts and developing contingency plans addressing potential problems that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
although the company intends to put into place programs and procedures designed to mitigate the aforementioned risks  there can be no assurances that all potential problems may be mitigated by these procedures

the total notional amount of the outstanding swaps exceeded the company s long term debt balance at december  the swaps that are considered hedges for currently outstanding debt are the million swap at maturing october  and the million swap which bears a fixed interest rate of and matures october  the company has entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for each of the fixed maturity securities on hand as of december  denominated in foreign currencies in order to hedge asset positions with respect to these securities

the company believes that cash flow generated by operations and its cash and investment balances  supplemented by the company s ability to borrow under its existing revolving credit facility or to conduct a public offering under its debt registration statement  will be sufficient to fund continuing operations and expected capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the aicpa issued statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop no 
provides guidance on the accounting for start up costs and organization costs 
it requires these costs to be expensed as incurred and  with certain exceptions  requires the initial application to be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  during the first quarter of  the company expects to recognize an after tax charge of approximately million related to the cumulative effect of the implementation of this pronouncement 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 all derivatives must be recognized on the balance sheet at their then fair value 
any stand alone deferred gains and losses remaining on the balance sheet under previous hedge accounting rules must be removed from the balance sheet and all hedging relationships must be designated anew and documented pursuant to the new accounting rules 
the new standard will be effective in the first quarter of the company is presently assessing the effect of sfas no 
on the financial statements of the company 
risk management and market sensitive instruments the company regularly evaluates its asset and liability interest rate risks as well as the appropriateness of investments relative to its internal investment guidelines 
the company operates within these guidelines by maintaining a well diversified portfolio  both across and within asset classes 
the company has retained an independent consultant to advise the company on the appropriateness of its investment policy and the compliance therewith 
asset interest rate risk is managed within a duration band tied to the company s liability interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by maintaining high average quality ratings and a well diversified portfolio 
the company s use of derivative instruments is generally limited to hedging purposes and has principally consisted of forward exchange contracts intended to minimize the portfolio s exposure to currency volatility associated with certain foreign bond holdings 
the company s investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for leveraging purposes as well as the creation of risk exposures not otherwise allowed within the policy 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements by exchanging the floating debt payments due under its outstanding indebtedness for fixed rate payments 
the company believes that this allows it to better anticipate its interest payments while helping to manage the asset liability relationship 
interest rate risk as of december   approximately of the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities maturing in more than one year  the value of which generally varies inversely with changes in interest rates 
however  the company s risk of fluctuation in the value of its fixed income portfolio due to changes in interest rates is partially mitigated by the company s existing interest rate swap agreements 
the company has evaluated the net impact to the fair value of its fixed income investments and interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical change in all interest rates of  and basis points bp 
in doing so  optionality was addressed through monte carlo simulation of the price behavior of securities with embedded options 
changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio are reflected in the balance sheet through stockholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements  to the extent they serve as effective hedges  are not currently reflected on the balance sheet 
under the requirements of sfas no 
 effective january   all derivative financial instruments will be reflected on the balance sheet at fair value 
the terms of the company s interest rate swap agreements are discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of this analysis as of december  are reflected in the table below 
increase decrease in fair value given an interest rate increase of bp bp bp in millions fixed income portfolio valuation of interest rate swap agreements the company believes that an interest rate shift in a month period of bp represents a moderately adverse outcome  while a bp shift is significantly adverse and a bp shift is unlikely given historical precedents 
although the company holds its bonds as available for sale for purposes of sfas no 
 the company s cash flows and the short duration of its investment portfolio should allow it to hold securities to maturity  thereby avoiding the recognition of losses  should interest rates rise significantly 
interest rate swap agreements the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to reduce the volatility of interest expense resulting from changes in interest rates 
as of december   the company had entered into million of floating to fixed rate swap agreements and also had million of libor based floating rate debt outstanding 
the company also receives a libor based payment as a result of its swap arrangements  thereby eliminating the payment exposure to changes in interest rates on that million of outstanding debt 
the marginal million of interest rate swaps in which the company has agreed to pay a fixed rate in exchange for receiving a libor based floating interest rate does expose the company to receiving a lower interest payment in the event of declining interest rates 
should libor decline by bp  the company would receive million less in annual pre tax interest income as a result of its swap arrangement 
rate declines of bp and bp would result in lower annual pre tax interest income of approximately million and million  respectively 
equity price risk the company s equity securities are comprised primarily of domestic stocks as well as certain foreign holdings 
assuming an immediate decrease of in equity prices  as of december   the hypothetical loss in fair value of stockholders equity is estimated to be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk the company has generally hedged the foreign exchange risk associated with its fixed income portfolio 
the company generally uses short term foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain fixed income securities denominated in foreign currencies 
therefore  the company believes that there is minimal risk to the fixed income portfolio due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s hedging program related to its foreign currency denominated investments is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not hedge its foreign exchange risk arising from equity investments denominated in foreign currencies 
assuming a foreign exchange loss of across all foreign equity investments  the net hypothetical pre tax loss in fair value as of december  is estimated to be million 
factors that may affect future results of operations certain statements contained herein  such as statements concerning potential or future loss ratios  expected membership attrition as the company continues to integrate its recently acquired operations  the pending transaction with cerulean and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements as such term is defined in the securities exchange act of 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those projected 
factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those discussed from time to time in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission 
completion of the company s pending transaction with cerulean is contingent upon  among other things  receipt of necessary approvals from certain federal and state agencies 
broad latitude in administering the applicable regulations is given to the agencies from which wellpoint and cerulean must seek these approvals 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained 
as a condition to approval of the transaction  regulatory agencies may impose requirements or limitations or costs on the way that the combined company conducts business after consummation of the transaction 
if the company or cerulean were to agree to any material requirements or limitations in order to obtain any approvals required to consummate the transaction  such requirements or limitations or additional costs associated therewith could adversely affect wellpoint s ability to integrate the operations of cerulean with those of wellpoint 
a material adverse effect on wellpoint s revenues and results of operations following completion of the transaction could result 
the company intends to incur debt to finance some or all of the cash payments to be made to cerulean shareholders in connection with the pending acquisition 
in addition  wellpoint has received authorization to  and is currently in the process of  repurchasing shares of wellpoint stock to offset shares that are expected to be issued in connection with the transaction 
the company has made significant purchases of treasury stock for this purpose utilizing excess cash as well as the incurrence of additional debt 
upon completion of the cerulean transaction  wellpoint could incur significant additional indebtedness to fund not only the cash portion of the transaction but to fund any further repurchase of shares of wellpoint stock 
such additional indebtedness may require that a significant amount of the company s cash flow be applied to the payment of interest  and there can be no assurance that the company s operations will generate sufficient cash flow to service the indebtedness 
any additional indebtedness may adversely affect the company s ability to finance its operations and could limit its ability to pursue business opportunities that may be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
as part of the company s business strategy  over the past three years the company has acquired substantial operations in new geographic markets 
the company has also recently entered into a merger agreement with cerulean  pursuant to which cerulean will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
these businesses  which include substantial indemnity based insurance operations  have experienced varying profitability or losses in recent periods 
since the relevant dates of acquisition of mmhd and gbo  the company has continued to work extensively on the integration of these businesses  however  there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate success of the company s integration efforts or regarding the ability of the company to maintain or improve the results of operations of the businesses of completed or pending transactions as the company pursues its strategy of motivating the acquired members to select managed care products 
in order to implement this business strategy  the company has and will  among other things  need to continue to incur considerable expenditures for provider networks  distribution channels and information systems in addition to the costs associated with the integration of these acquisitions 
the integration of these complex businesses may result in  among other things  temporary increases in claims inventory or other service related issues that may negatively affect the company s relationship with its customers and contribute to increased attrition of such customers 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected in the event that the company experiences such problems or is otherwise unable to implement fully its expansion strategy 
the company s operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal  state and local agencies in all jurisdictions in which the company operates 
many of these agencies have increased their scrutiny of managed health care companies in recent periods 
the company also provides insurance products to medi cal beneficiaries in various california counties under contracts with the california department of health services and provides administrative services to the health care finance administration hcfa in various capacities 
there can be no assurance that acting as a government contractor in these circumstances will not increase the risk of heightened scrutiny by such government agencies and that profitability from this business will not be adversely affected through inadequate premium rate increases due to governmental budgetary issues 
future actions by any regulatory agencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements by the california department of corporations  various other state departments of insurance and the blue cross blue shield association 
although the company is currently in compliance with all applicable requirements  there can be no assurances that such requirements will not be increased in the future 
the company s future results will depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs incurred on existing business and upon the company s ability to control future health care costs through product and benefit design  underwriting criteria  utilization management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in mandated benefits  utilization rates  demographic characteristics  health care practices  provider consolidation  inflation  new pharmaceuticals technologies  clusters of high cost cases  the regulatory environment and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan provider and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
periodic renegotiation of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs and limit the company s ability to negotiate favorable rates 
recently  large physician practice management companies have experienced extreme financial difficulties including bankruptcy  which may subject the company to increased credit risk related to provider groups 
additionally  the company faces competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  select underwriting criteria or negotiate competitive provider contracts may adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
managed care organizations  both inside and outside california  operate in a highly competitive environment that has undergone significant change in recent years as a result of business consolidations  new strategic alliances  aggressive marketing practices by competitors and other market pressures 
additional increases in competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
as a result of the company s recent acquisitions  the company now operates on a national basis and offers a spectrum of health care and specialty products through various risk sharing arrangements 
the company s health care products include a variety of managed care offerings as well as traditional fee for service coverage 
with respect to product type  fee for service products are generally less profitable than managed care products 
a critical component of the company s expansion strategy is to transition over time the traditional insurance members of the company s acquired businesses to more managed care products 
with respect to the risk sharing nature of products  managed care products that involve greater potential risk to the company generally tend to be more profitable than management services products and those managed care products where the company is able to shift risks to employer groups 
individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase the company s higher risk managed care products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditures 
typically  government sponsored programs involve the company s higher risk managed care products 
over the past few years  the company has experienced greater margin erosion in its higher risk managed care products than in its lower risk managed care and management services products 
this margin erosion is attributable to product mix change  product design  competitive pressure and greater regulatory restrictions applicable to the small employer group market 
in  the company implemented price increases in certain of its managed care businesses 
in response to higher than anticipated utilization with respect to certain co payment products offered to the company s individual and small group customers in california  the company has recently implemented premium increases with respect to such products 
while these price increases are intended to improve profitability  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
subsequent unfavorable changes in the relative profitability between the company s various products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and on the continued feasibility of the company s geographic expansion strategy 
substantially all of the company s investment assets are in interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities or equity securities 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase or increasing as such rates decrease 
in addition  the value of equity securities can fluctuate significantly with changes in market conditions 
changes in the value of the company s investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  can affect the company s stockholders equity 
there can be no assurances that interest rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the company is dependent on retaining existing employees and attracting additional qualified employees to meet its future needs 
the company faces intense competition for qualified personnel  especially qualified computer programmers  actuaries and other professional and technical employees 
there can be no assurances that an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations
