the teams responsibilities included the following functional areas factory equipment and facilities  business system software  desktop computers  telecommunications system and network hardware and software systems  and customers  suppliers  and business partners 
factory equipment includes automated test equipment and test data collection systems 
the high reliability nature of the company s products calls for test  test data collection and data retention 
this need is generally called for in product performance specifications  such as mil prf the factory and facility equipment are yk compliant

in most cases  the company has multiple sources of supplies 
the sole source supplier of the company has sufficient supplies on hand for microsemi 
the activities of the company s yk project teams include the development of contingency plans 
due to the complexity of the yk issues  there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to address all internal and external failures or that undetected yk issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the contingency plans  even if successful and effective  may result in loss of efficiencies  increased costs  and other adverse effects on the company s business and operations
