item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations for cornerstone propane partners  lp and its subsidiary  cornerstone propane  lp collectively cornerstone or the partnership should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and the pro forma financial information elsewhere herein 
general the partnership is a delaware limited partnership formed in october to own and operate the propane businesses and assets of syn inc and its subsidiaries synergy  empire energy corporation and its subsidiaries empire  and cgi holdings  inc and its subsidiaries coast 
the partnership s two principal business segments are its retail and coast energy group ceg operations 
the partnership believes it is the fourth largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  serving more than  residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural customers from customer service centers in states 
because a substantial portion of the partnership s propane is used in the weather sensitive residential markets  the heating degree days in the partnership s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  have a significant effect on the financial performance of the partnership 
heating degree days are a general indicator of weather impacting propane usage and are calculated by taking the difference between degrees and the average temperature of the day if less than degrees 
warmer than normal temperatures will generally result in reduced propane use 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers ordinarily generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  gross profit margins could vary significantly from year to year in a period of identical sales volumes

financing and sources of liquidity financing of investments in acquisitions and property  plant and equipment had been obtained through a balanced funding approach which included issuance of additional common units  placement of senior notes and utilization of bank credit facility advances 
in october  the partnership filed a form s registration statement covering the proposed issuance of  common units for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions  working capital  expansion of the partnership s propane business by internal growth and repayment of indebtedness 
in december  the partnership issued million additional common units as part of the funding for the propane continental  inc acquisition 
approximately  units are available for issuance under this registration statement as of june  additionally  approximately  units were issued in fiscal to the selling shareholders of propane continental  inc and other acquired businesses  which did not require the use of cash 
in june  cornerstone propane partners  lp the master limited partnership issued million of senior notes with a fixed annual interest rate of pursuant to note purchase agreements with various investors 
these notes were issued principally to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
these notes mature on june   and require semi annual interest payments each december and june the note agreement requires that the principal be paid in equal annual installments of million starting june in december  cornerstone propane  lp the operating partnership issued million of senior notes with a fixed annual interest rate of pursuant to note purchase agreements with various investors 
the proceeds from these notes were principally related to the propane continental  inc acquisition 
these notes mature on january   and require semi annual interest payments each january and july the note agreement requires that the principal be paid in equal annual installments of million starting january  in addition to the senior notes mentioned above  the operating partnership had previously issued million of senior notes with a fixed annual interest rate of pursuant to note purchase agreements with various investors 
these notes were issued in conjunction with the ipo in december these notes mature on december   and require semi annual interest payments each december and june the note agreement requires that the principal be paid in equal annual installments of million starting december  during fiscal  the operating partnership entered into a refunding credit agreement the refunding credit agreement which principally modified the allocation of funds available for working capital and acquisition needs and revised some of the debt covenants from the previous agreement 
the refunding credit agreement has a working capital facility the working capital facility and an acquisition facility the acquisition facility 
the working capital facility provides for revolving borrowings up to million including a million sublimit for letters of credit and matures on november  the refunding credit agreement provides that there must be no amount outstanding under the working capital facility excluding letters of credit in excess of million for at least consecutive days during each fiscal year 
at june   million was outstanding under the working capital facility 
issued outstanding letters of credit totaled million at june  the acquisition facility provides the operating partnership with the ability to borrow up to million to finance propane business acquisitions 
the acquisition facility operates as a revolving facility through november  there were no amounts outstanding on the acquisition facility at june  both the working capital facility and the acquisition facility can be extended one year upon approval of the banks 
the acquisition facility can be converted to a two year term note beginning on november  at june   the applicable base and eurodollar rates were and  respectively

to 
depending upon coverage ratios 
the operating partnership s obligations under the senior notes and refunding credit agreements and the master limited partnership s obligations are secured by a security interest in the partnership s inventory  accounts receivable and propane storage tanks 
the notes and refunding credit agreements contain various terms and covenants including financial covenants with respect to debt and interest coverage and limitations  among others  on the ability of the partnership and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  make investments and loans  sell assets and enter into mergers  consolidations or sales of all or substantially all assets 
the operating partnership and master limited partnership were in compliance with all terms and covenants at june  market risk the partnership has limited exposure to technology risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
strategies and procedures in the normal course of business  the partnership employs various strategies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and changes in commodity prices 
concentration of credit risk the partnership s trade receivables and short term investments do not represent significant concentration of credit risk at june   due to the wide variety of customers and markets in which the partnership s products and services are sold 
none of the partnership s customers account for more than of the partnership s revenue or receivable balances at june  short term investments at any single financial institution account for less than of the partnership s current assets 
commodity price risk commodity price risk arises from the risk of price changes in the commodities that the partnership buys and sells and as a consequence of providing price risk management services to customers 
futures and forward contracts are utilized to alter the partnership s exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of propane  natural gas and crude oil 
if commodity prices changed by  the impact on open positions at june  would be approximately million 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to the partnership s customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
the partnership enters into hedging instruments to lock into purchases when prices are deemed favorable by management 
interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from having variable rate debt obligations  as changing interest rates impact the partnership s future cash flows and net income 
the partnership s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the partnership maintains the majority of its debt in fixed rate instruments and periodically places some of its floating rate debt under short term fixed rate eurodollar loans 
on the partnership s variable rate debt  a change in interest rates of one percentage point would change interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency rate risk arises from the partnership s canadian operations 
the partnership s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes and to allow management to focus its attention on its core business issues and activities 
accordingly  the partnership enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities and foreign currency sales 
if foreign exchange rates changed by  projected earnings would change by approximately million due to the translation of earnings in foreign currencies 
it is the partnership s policy to enter into interest rate and foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the partnership does not enter into interest or foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
year readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of computer programs using only the last two digits to indicate the year 
if uncorrected  such computer programs will not be able to interpret dates correctly beyond the year and  in some cases prior to that time as some computer experts believe  which could cause computer system failures or other computer errors disrupting business operations 
recognizing the potentially severe consequences of the failure to be year compliant  the partnership s management has developed and implemented a company wide program to identify and remedy the year issues 
a project team  consisting of the partnership s director of information systems and the partnership s key is managers who supervise operations at each of the partnership s three main regional facilities in california  missouri and texas  together with the chief information officer of northwestern corporation  the managing general partner s parent corporation  was created to manage the partnership s year issues  enabling a smooth transition into the year the project team reports directly to executive management who have assigned a high priority to such efforts within the partnership 
the scope of the partnership s year readiness program includes the review and evaluation of i the partnership s information technology it such as hardware and software utilized in the operation of the partnership s business  ii the partnership s non it systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various equipment and facilities  and iii the readiness of third parties  including customers  suppliers and other key vendors to the partnership  and the electronic data interchange edi with those key third parties 
if needed modifications and conversions are not made on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s operations 
the partnership is currently using internal and external resources to identify  correct and test large quantities of lines of application software code for systems that were developed internally 
remediation of these systems is scheduled for completion in october except for the partnership s retail information system  consisting principally of its billing and accounts receivable systems  which is already year compliant 
since january  the partnership has been converting its old billing system installed at each of the approximately customer service centers to the new retail information system 
currently  approximately of the partnership s customer service centers are running the new system  with the roll out to the balance of the centers scheduled to be completed in october software developed externally has been evaluated for year compliance and is being upgraded or replaced 
the partnership s nt platform based year compliant financial system was installed in january the new financial system encompasses general ledger  accounts payable and fixed assets 
remediation efforts for sub systems integrated with the financial system are scheduled for completion in october the partnership s oil and gas systems are being replaced with a year compliant third party vendor solution 
scheduled completion date for this project is november the partnership is using this process as an opportunity to upgrade and enhance its information systems 
in addition to internal year remediation activities  the partnership has contacted key suppliers  vendors and customers to determine their readiness for the year  surveying each of them about their compliance and contingency plans to supply the partnership upon the approach and arrival of the year while none of the partnership s products are directly date sensitive  the supply and transportation of propane gas products are dependent upon companies whose own systems may need to be year compliant 
if third parties do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way compatible with the partnership s systems  the arrival of the year could have an adverse effect on partnership operations 
the partnership believes that its actions with key suppliers  vendors and customers minimizes these risks 
furthermore  no single customer accounts for more than of the partnership s consolidated gross profits  thus mitigating the adverse risk to the partnership s business if some but not all customers are not year compliant 
also  only a minimal number of transactions are conducted through edi 
the partnership s primary focus has been directed at resolving the year problem 
while the partnership expects its internal it and non it systems to be year compliant by the dates specified  the partnership has developed a contingency plan specifying what the partnership will do if it or important third parties are not year compliant by the required dates 
a majority of such a contingency plan is based on manual back up systems  procedures and practices 
through june   the partnership estimates that incremental costs of approximately million have been incurred and expensed related to year issues 
since many systems are being modified to provide significant enhanced capabilities  the year expenses have not been nor are planned to be specifically tracked 
the current estimated additional cost to complete remediation is expected to be less than million 
the partnership expects that a portion of these costs will be capitalized  as they are principally related to adding new software applications and functionality 
other costs will continue to be expensed as incurred 
the partnership s current estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to remediate and test its computer systems are based on the facts and circumstances existing at this time 
the estimates were made using assumptions of future events including the continued availability of existing resources  year modification plans  implementation success by third parties  and other factors 
new developments may occur that could affect the partnership s estimates of the amount of time and costs necessary to modify and test its it and non it systems for year compliance 
these developments include  but are not limited to  i the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  ii the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and equipment and iii the planning and year compliance success that key suppliers  vendors and customers attain 
in october  president clinton signed into law the year readiness disclosure act 
the partnership intends to obtain the benefits of the act s protections by implementing certain procedures described in that act 
forward looking statements the information presented herein may contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
the partnership s actual future performance will be affected by a number of factors  risks and uncertainties  including without limitation  weather conditions  regulatory changes  competitive factors  the partnership s success in dealing with the year issues and the operations of vendors  suppliers and customers  many of which are beyond the partnership s control 
future events and results may vary substantially from what the partnership currently foresees  and there can be no assurance that the partnership s actual results will not differ materially from its expectations 
the partnership undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revision to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
inflation and economic trends although its operations are affected by general economic trends  the partnership does not believe that inflation had a material effect on the results of its operations during the past three fiscal years
