the year issue is the result of many computer programs being written abbreviating dates by using two digits rather than four digits in the year field 
as a result  unless corrected  a computer program that has date sensitive software may recognize a date using in the year field as rather than the year this could result in system failures and errors causing disruptions to various aspects of our business  including computer systems  voice and data networks and building infrastructures 
the company began a review of its computer systems and related software in fiscal to identify systems and software which might malfunction due to a misidentification of the year a committee consisting of members of senior management from various disciplines was formed and is meeting regularly to discuss the steps to be taken  and the results of steps that have been completed  to deal with any potential year issues 
the company s plan to address the year issue consists of six phases i awareness ii assessment iii remediation iv testing v implementation and vi contingency planning 
for the company s internal computer systems and software  the awareness and assessment phases have been completed and the remediation stage is in process 
testing and implementation are expected to be completed by september most of the company s customer related computer systems and databases  including its billing systems  are managed by third parties under contractual arrangements 
we have taken an active role in monitoring the progress of these third parties  including selective year compliance testing 
the company has been informed by these third parties that their remediation efforts are in various stages with final completion anticipated in september for the local equipment used in the transmission and reception of all signals  the company completed the awareness and assessment phases in any remediation efforts that were necessary have since been completed and the company believes this local equipment is year compliant 
the company s systems are interconnected with various networks and systems operated by third parties  including landline communications networks  long distance networks  the networks of other wireless service providers as well as public utilities 
the operators of these networks and systems are responsible for addressing the year issue in their own systems 
the ability of the company s systems to operate  including the ability to provide wireless service  is dependent upon these third party networks and systems being year compliant 
we have requested information from these vendors in order to determine to what extent we may be exposed to their failure to correct their own year problems 
while many of these third parties have indicated to the company that they are or anticipate being year compliant prior to december   the company cannot assure that these third parties will have taken the necessary corrective actions prior to the year we currently believe that the company s worst case scenario with respect to the year may involve the interruption of telecommunications or public utilities services and or interruption of customer billing 
either or both of these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has contingency plans in place for maintaining and restoring service in the event of a natural disaster  power failure or software related interruption of service  and is working to utilize this experience in the development and implementation of its year contingency plans 
the company s year contingency plans will consist of the following identifying teams that will be on site at the network operating centers at the time of the date change to monitor the networks and critical systems to react immediately to commence repairs  developing alternate plans for critical work processes in the event these processes experience year disruptions  and developing alternate processes to support critical customer functions in the event mechanized processes experience year disruptions 
the company anticipates having these year contingency plans in place before december the amounts expended to date by the company related to year compliance have not been material and have been expensed as incurred 
the company does not anticipate that future amounts to be expended related to year compliance will be material or have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

highly competitive industry the company s ability to maintain or increase its offering of wireless telephone and other communications services can be subject to the changes in consumer demand  price competition  and the cost and supply of hardware  software and other technology required to provide such services 
future profitability also may be affected by the company s ability to compete with other communications service enterprises 
in each market the company offers service  there are competitive providers of wireless telephone service  including providers of cellular  pcs  enhanced specialized mobile radio esmr and satellite services 
competition for customers in each of the company s markets is principally on the basis of the technical quality of service  price  size of area covered  services and enhancements offered  capacity and responsiveness of customer service 
many of the company s competitors have financial resources which are substantially greater than those of the company and its partners in such markets 
the company also faces competition from resellers 
the fcc requires providers of wireless telephone services to offer service to resellers on a nondiscriminatory basis 
a reseller buys blocks of telephone numbers from a wireless telephone service provider  usually at a discounted rate  and resells the service to the public for a profit 
many telecommunications companies resell wireless telephone service as a complement to other services  such as long distance or local telephone services 
in addition to competition from cellular and broadband pcs licensees  there is also competition from a variety of other communications technologies 
see item business competition competing technologies 
continuing technological advances in the communications field make it impossible to predict the extent of additional future competition for wireless systems  but it is certain that in the future there will be more potential substitutes for wireless service 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face significant future competition or that the company s current wireless technology will not eventually become obsolete 
highly regulated industry the licensing  ownership  construction  operation and sale of controlling interests in wireless telephone systems are regulated by the fcc 
certain aspects of wireless telephone system ownership  sale  construction  and operation including  but not limited to  rates and the resale of wireless service may be subject to public utility or other state and municipal regulation in the areas in which the company provides service 
changes in the regulation of wireless telephone system operators or their activities such as increased price regulation by state authorities or a decision by the fcc to permit more than two licensees in each service area could adversely affect the business and operating results of the company 
in addition  fcc licenses are subject to renewal and regulatory compliance requirements 
the transfer of a license or any controlling interest in a license is subject to prior approval by the fcc 
developing and changing technologies  subscriber cancellations the success of the company s operations may be adversely affected by matters beyond its control  such as changes in technology  decisions by the federal government as to spectrum allocation and competition  and the future cost of wireless telephones 
the company and the industry have also been affected by high rates of subscriber cancellations that require continuing replacement of the customer base in order to maintain subscription levels and revenues 
restrictive covenants  consequences of default the terms of the company s credit facility require the company to meet and maintain certain financial and operating covenants 
the credit facility also restricts the company from directly or indirectly declaring or paying any dividends on its presently or subsequently issued common stock  limits the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness and limits any distributions of assets to its stockholders 
the company was in compliance with all of the above covenants as of may  the company presently expects to remain in compliance with such covenants  but there can be no assurance to such effect
