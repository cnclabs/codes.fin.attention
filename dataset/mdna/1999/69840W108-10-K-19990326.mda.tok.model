the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
the year issue is the result of manufactured equipment and computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s equipment and computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions  generate invoices or engage in similar normal business practices 
during  the company formed an ongoing internal review team to address the year issue that encompasses operating and administrative areas of the company 
internal information technology professionals are working to identify and resolve all significant year issues in a timely and effective manner 
the company s executive management monitors the status of the year remediation plans  including an assessment of issues and development of said remediation plans  where necessary  as they relate to internally used software  computer hardware and use of computer applications 
to date  the company has assigned a full time year manager  completed a comprehensive inventory of all systems in the cafes  commissaries and corporate offices and has notified critical vendors of the company s requirements pertaining to the year issue 
the company has completed its assessment of the year impact for both information technology it and non it systems 
in regards to it systems  the company has identified the following as the main areas of year focus payroll systems  financial systems  network integration systems  register and store management systems 
network integration systems are corporate office electronic systems and tools which link various information subsystems and databases  encompassing e mail and all major financial systems  such as general ledger database systems  and all major operational systems  such as store operating performance database systems 
register systems are the point of sale systems used within each retail bakery cafe  which are electronically linked with the personal computer based store management systems also located within each retail bakery cafe  providing cafe management tools for the cafe management

the company is currently in contact with vendors and or landlords in order to assess the potential impact 
based on initial review the company believes the potential impact of year issues pertaining to non it systems to be minor 
upon full assessment of the impact of year issues  the company will address  in order of criticality  the potential issues  and will develop remediation and contingency plans 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to assure year compliance  it is dependent on key business partner and or vendor compliance to some extent 
the year issue is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
if  due to unforeseen circumstances  the implementation is not completed on a timely basis  or key business partners and or vendors fail to resolve all significant year issues in a timely and effective manner  the year could have a material adverse impact on the company 
in addition to the estimated costs outlined above  the company has estimated the costs for adopting all worst case contingency plans to be approximately the following chart depicts the phases  status  timetable  estimated cost of completion  contingency plans and risks  and estimated cost of implementing contingency plans pertaining to year issues associated with it systems
