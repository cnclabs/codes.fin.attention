d cash dividends per common share are those of the savannah bancorp  inc historical liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the objectives of funds management include maintaining adequate liquidity and reasonable harmony between the repricing of sources and uses of funds or interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the goal of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funds to meet the loan demand and the deposit withdrawal needs of the bank s customers 
this is achieved through maintaining a combination of sufficient liquid assets  core deposit growth and unused capacity to purchase funds in the money markets 
during  loans increased million  or  and deposits increased million  or resulting in an decrease in the loan to deposit ratio from at the beginning of the year to at year end 
during  management plans to emphasize both loan and deposit growth and to target a loan to deposit ratio in the to range 
core deposit growth will be accomplished through marketing strategies  competitive interest rates and through the opportunities at our new medical arts office which opened in september both subsidiary banks are members and shareholders of the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
as a member of the fhlb  the bank has access to short term and long term borrowings at favorable rates 
these borrowings can be used for liquidity  asset liability management and matched loan funding purposes 
the subsidiary banks also have million of federal funds borrowing lines available from correspondent banks 
a continuing objective of the bank s asset liability management is to maintain a high level of variable rate assets  including variable rate loans and shorter maturity investments  to balance increases in interest rate sensitive liabilities 
interest sensitivity management and its effects on the net interest margin require analyses and actions that take into consideration volumes repriced and the timing and magnitude of their change 
the company s cash flow maturity and repricing gap at december   was million within one year  or percent of total interest earning assets 
fixed rate earning assets with maturities over five years totaled  or percent of total interest earning assets 
the maturity and repricing gap between one and five years will adjust significantly each year through normal loan and deposit activity 
based on the presently expected principal cash flows and interest rates and the policies and procedures in place to monitor interest rate risk  management believes interest rate risk is being adequately managed within reasonable earnings fluctuation tolerances 
the short term asset sensitivity position of the company indicates that net interest income will be impacted negatively when the prime rate and deposit rates decline 
soon after the rate declines stop  net interest income will be impacted positively due to the continued time deposit repricing at lower rates 
the opposite is true in the event of rising rates 
the gap position after one year is of less concern because management has time to respond to changing financial conditions with actions that reduce the impact of the longer term gap positions 
however  fixed rate assets with maturities over five years may include significant rate risk in the event of significant market rate increases where the subsidiary banks have no opportunity to reprice the earning asset 
the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had unfunded commitments to extend credit of  and outstanding stand by letters of credit of  since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
management does not anticipate that funding obligations arising from these financial instruments will adversely impact its ability to fund future loan growth or deposit withdrawals 
table long term maturity gap and repricing data the following is the long term maturity and repricing data for the company as of december  thousands fair interest bearing assets beyond total value investment securities         federal funds sold    loans fixed rates         loans variable rates         total earning assets         interest bearing deposits now and savings a         money market accounts a         time  m and over     other time        total interest bearing deposits         other borrowings    federal home loan bank advances     total interest bearing liabilities         gap excess assets liabilities        gap cumulative        a estimated cash flow runoff of per year has been assumed 
the company s cash flow gap is  within one year  or ten percent of total interest earning assets 
fixed rate earning assets with maturities over five years total  or five percent of total interest earning assets 
the cash flow gaps between one and five years will adjust significantly each year through normal loan and deposit activity 
based on the principal cash flows and interest rates presented above  and the policies and procedures in place to monitor interest rate risk  management believes interest rate risk is being adequately managed within reasonable earnings fluctuation tolerances of percent of the net interest income 
financial condition and capital resources the financial condition of the company can be assessed by examining the changes and relationships in the sources and uses of funds as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
good loan and core deposit growth resulted in an increase of  or percent  in net interest income 
the company increased its investment in callable us government agency securities in in general  investments have expected maturities of less than five years 
tax exempt bank qualified municipals total million  or approximately percent of the investment portfolio  and have weighted average maturities of approximately years 
at december   approximately percent of equity capital  or  was invested in bank premises and equipment 
the savannah bank  na has classified all investment securities as available for sale since january  bryan bank trust classified their municipal bonds as held to maturity until their merger with the company in december  in  a decrease in us treasury market rates of approximately to basis points caused net unrealized gains on available for sale securities to increase to from at december  these amounts are included in shareholders equity at december  in other accumulated comprehensive income 
the company s lending and investment policies continue to emphasize high quality growth 
these policies do translate in to lower net interest margins  however  management believes these policies are in the best interests of the shareholders and customers in the long term  as they lessen the negative impact of a recessionary business cycle 
management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company 
the office of the comptroller of the currency occ has adopted capital requirements that specify the minimum level for which no prompt corrective action is required 
in addition  the fdic adopted fdic insurance assessment rates based on certain well capitalized risk based and equity capital ratios 
as of december   the company and the bank exceed the minimum requirements necessary to be classified as well capitalized 
total equity capital for the company is  or of total assets 
management expects that the company s and the bank s capital ratios will continue to remain above the well capitalized capital ratio level  even in the event of future substantial increases in market rates 
the high capital ratio and expected future earnings will allow the bank to continue its aggressive growth objectives without having to raise additional capital in the near future
