item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes associated with them contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future 
such discussion represents only the best present assessment by management of the company 
during  management implemented a business strategy that emphasized acquisition of long lived  proved reserves with significant exploitation and development opportunities that management considered to have a lower risk profile than the company s historic projects 
prior to and under prior management  the company was primarily focused on developing and selling higher risk  non operated exploratory and development projects and did not focus on acquisitions 
in order to improve the economics of acquisitions  the company emphasizes strict cost control in all aspects of its business and seeks to operate its properties wherever possible 
the company also participates  to a lesser extent  in selected exploration projects on a controlled risk basis 
as a part of the company s new strategy  in june the company acquired the panoma properties for a net purchase price of million from burlington  which included interests in gas wells in the texas panhandle and western oklahoma and an associated mile gas gathering system 
the company assumed operations of approximately of the wells and of the gathering system and began planning for increased density development drilling on the panoma properties 
in january the company purchased for million a interest in a gas processing plant  the mclean gas plant  which currently processes of the gas produced from the panoma properties 
the company receives of the net profits of the plant until it recoups its investment  after which time the company will receive of the net profits 
at january   the company had recouped approximately of its million investment 
management believes that the acquisition of the mclean gas plant allows the company to capture a significant portion of the profits generated from processing the gas produced at the panoma properties that would otherwise go to third party processors 
in april the company purchased the permian basin properties from burlington for a net purchase price of million after purchase price adjustments of million 
these properties consist of approximately  producing oil and gas wells and associated acreage in west texas and southeast new mexico 
this acquisition substantially increased the company s cash flow and inventory of exploitation  development and exploration opportunities 
on april  the company received and accepted two new loan commitments from bankers trust company  as agent  and other banks for senior credit facilities for the company and several of its subsidiaries 
the two new senior credit facilities were structured as the million credit facility with a term of five years and a million one year senior subordinated bridge facility the term loan facility convertible into a five year term loan 
the new credit facilities were conditioned  among other things  upon the closing of the permian basin acquisition  which took place on april  the credit facility provided the company the flexibility of choosing a range of either libor or prime based interest rate options 
this credit facility replaced the company s previously existing million revolving credit facility 
on may   the company placed  through a rule a private placement offering  million in senior notes due the notes have a coupon  with interest payable on june and december  commencing on december  except for bluebird energy  inc there is no restriction on the ability of any consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiary to transfer funds to the company in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances 
net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to completely repay the company s outstanding bridge loan facility in the principal amount of million with the remaining proceeds used to repay a substantial portion of the company s outstanding revolving credit facility 
at that time  the maximum commitment under the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million  with a borrowing base of million 
the credit facility was amended as of september   to increase the maximum commitment from million to million  increase the borrowing base by million to million  and modify the interest expense coverage ratio test 
on december   the company acquired a thirty percent membership interest in ngts  llc  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of natural gas transmission services  inc  a natural gas marketing and trading company 
ngts  llc assumed all of the parent company s operations as of december  the company  as of december   dedicated its natural gas production to ngts  llc for marketing 
the company s million acquisition was completed for a combination of cash million and promissory notes million that had equity put features 
the company retired the promissory notes with cash on january  on january   the company commenced a cash purchase offer for units of tel offshore trust 
previous to the offer  the company owned  units representing of the units outstanding 
as amended  the offer was to purchase between forty percent and sixty percent of the trust s outstanding units at per unit 
on march   the company purchased  units pursuant to the tender offer and  together with the units it previously owned  became the owner of approximately of the total number of units outstanding for an aggregate of million 
on december   the company through its newly formed owned subsidiary  bluebird energy  inc acquired from spirit natural gas reserves and associated assets in producing fields located in oklahoma and texas currently producing about million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day 
the net purchase price was approximately million after certain purchase price adjustments  including preferential rights exercised by third parties and other customary adjustments 
as part of the capitalization of bluebird  the company contributed  units of tel offshore trust 
bluebird  as an unrestricted subsidiary as defined under certain credit agreements  is neither a guarantor of the company s senior notes due nor can it be included in the determining compliance with certain financial covenants under the company s credit agreements 
to finance the spirit acquisition  bluebird borrowed million under a bridge loan facility with banks 
the maturity date of the bridge loan facility  as amended  is april  the loan is non recourse to the company 
bluebird has secured a commitment for permanent financing from a bank providing for a revolving credit facility of million with an initial borrowing base of million  due three years from the date of closing anticipated to be april  with interest rates for both libor and base rate prime 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved oil and gas reserves 
to the extent that such capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes exceed the sec pv of estimated future net cash flow from proved reserves of oil and gas  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties after income tax effects  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices increase 
due primarily to the severe decline in world crude oil and natural gas prices experienced in  the company recognized a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties of million at december  pursuant to the ceiling limitation required by the full cost method of accounting  using certain improvements in pricing experienced after the end of the period 
without the benefit of improvements in pricing subsequent to december   the company would have incurred an impairment of million 
results of operations for the years ended and as discussed above  the company acquired the permian basin properties in april  and its interest in tel in march unless otherwise stated  the increases in the period over the period were substantially a result of these acquisitions and the increases in daily oil and gas production associated with the company s successful drilling operations

 from the early extinguishment of bank debt 
the early extinguishment was a result of the notes financing and new amended revolving credit agreements with banks arranged to repay the company s previous credit facility in conjunction with the purchase of the permian basin properties from burlington 
the net loss in  after the extraordinary charge  applicable to common shareholders was million per common share compared to net income of  
per common share in the company accrued  in dividends on its preferred stock in versus  in liquidity and capital resources the company has three principal operating sources of cash i sales of oil and gas  ii revenues from gas gathering  processing  and marketing  and iii revenues from petroleum management and consulting services 
the company s cash flow is highly dependent upon oil and gas prices 
decreases in the market price of oil and gas could result in reductions of both cash flow and the borrowing base under the company s credit facility  which would result in decreased funds available  including funds for capital expenditures 
in december the company issued million of tcw preferred stock to facilitate its development drilling program 
on april  the company closed the acquisition of the permian basin properties for a net purchase price of approximately million 
at the same time  the company s previously existing million credit facility was replaced by two new credit facilities  a million credit facility and a million term loan facility for a combined aggregate amount of million 
the initial advances under these new facilities totaled million  including funds to complete the permian basin acquisition  to pay principal and accrued interest remaining on the company s previous credit facility  and to provide cash for working capital purposes 
on may  the company sold  through a rule a private placement offering  million aggregate principal amount of notes 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to completely repay the company s term loan facility in the principal amount of million and to repay a substantial portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
the notes bear interest at per annum  with interest payable on june and december commencing on december  after paydown  the maximum commitment under the credit facility was reduced from million to million  with a borrowing base of million 
the credit facility was amended effective september  to increase the maximum commitment from million to million  increase the borrowing base by million to million and modify the consolidated ebitda to interest expense ratio 
in july  the credit facility was enhanced by extending the term of the facility from four to five years  improving the tests concerning certain financial covenants which the company must meet  and lowering interest rate spreads by percent 
in december  the credit facility was amended to allow for a temporary increase of the borrowing base to million in anticipation of the sale of preferred stock described below 
with these adjustments  total long term debt under the credit facility at december  was million  leaving million available to draw at such time  prior to the next borrowing base redetermination 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents a working capital deficiency of thousand  in addition to the funds available under the credit facility 
the company called for redemption on november  its publicly traded warrants  each of which was exercisable for three shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and redeemable at per warrant 
as a result  warrants were exercised for an aggregate of  shares of common stock and the remaining warrants covering  shares of common stock were redeemed 
the company received cash proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  during june and october    warrants and  warrants were exercised at per share and an average of per share  respectively  resulting in net proceeds to the company of  on november   the company sold  newly issued shares of its common stock in a public offering  receiving cash proceeds of approximately million after fees and expenses 
in september  the company announced a stock repurchase program of up to one million shares at a cost not to exceed million 
at december   the company had repurchased  shares for million 
in february  the program was revised to remove the share limitation discussed above 
in december  the company s owned subsidiary  bluebird energy  inc  acquired for approximately million  certain natural gas reserves and related assets from spirit additionally  the company capitalized bluebird with  units of tel offshore trust 
to finance the spirit acquisition  bluebird borrowed million under a bridge loan facility with banks 
the maturity date of the bridge loan facility  as amended  is april   and is non recourse to the company 
bluebird has secured a commitment for permanent financing from a bank providing for a revolving credit facility of million with an initial borrowing base of million  due three years from the date of closing anticipated to be april  with interest rates for both libor and base rate prime 
in december  the company announced a letter of intent for a strategic alliance with another company  to include the purchase by this company of million of the company s convertible preferred stock 
in february this transaction was consummated 
the preferred stock has a liquidation value of million and is convertible into the company s common stock at per share 
dividends on the preferred stock will be payable in cash beginning august of at the rate of per annum and will be cumulative 
the net proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock  million  was used to repay senior bank indebtedness 
for  the company had a net increase in cash of million 
the company s operating activities provided net cash of million  principally from operating income before depreciation  depletion  write down of oil and gas properties and deferred tax benefit  as well as a reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable 
the company used million in investing activities for additions to property and equipment and other investments 
cash flow from financing activities were million  consisting of proceeds from issuance of long term debt of million  the payment of principal on long and short term debt of million  the purchase of treasury stock for million and other uses  including the payment of thousand in dividends on preferred stock 
for  the company had a net increase in cash of million 
the company s operating activities provided net cash of million  principally from operating income before depreciation  depletion  and deferred taxes  reduced by a net increase in accounts receivable over accounts payable 
the company used million in investing activities  principally for additions to property and equipment of million 
financing activities provided million of cash  principally from the aggregate proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million  less principal payments of million on this debt  as well as proceeds from issuance of common stock of million and proceeds from short term notes payable of million 
the company also paid  in dividends on preferred stock 
for  the company had a net increase in cash of  the company s operating activities provided net cash of million  principally from operating income before depreciation  depletion and deferred taxes  reduced by a net increase in accounts receivable over accounts payable 
the company used million in investing activities  principally for additions to property and equipment of million  as well as increases in deposits and other assets 
financing activities provided million of cash  principally from the aggregate proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million and production payments of  less the combined payments on such debt and production payments totaling million  as well as proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million 
the company also paid  to redeem a portion of the outstanding series c preferred stock and  to pay dividends on preferred stock 
capital requirements for fiscal the company has budgeted approximately million for development and exploration activities  including million budgeted for development projects on the permian basin  panoma properties and walker county and million budgeted for exploration projects 
while the company has not yet developed a budget for fiscal  the reserve report includes capital expenditures of approximately million on development activities 
the company is not contractually obligated to proceed with any of its budgeted capital expenditures 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within the company s control or ability to forecast  including drilling results and changes in oil and gas prices 
due to the recent decline in oil and gas prices  the company may redirect some of its budgeted funds or it may defer certain projects until a later date 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
in connection with the acquisition of of the outstanding common member s equity of ngts  the company was obligated to pay a note of million to current and former shareholders of ngts 
the loan repayment was originally at the company s option payable in common stock or cash at december  the repayment date was amended to february  and was paid on such date by the company with cash 
during february  the company closed its sale of convertible preferred stock realizing net proceeds of approximately million  which were principally used to repay senior bank indebtedness 
based upon the company s anticipated level of operations  the company believes that cash flow from operations together with the availability under the credit facility approximately million after the sale of convertible preferred stock in february will be adequate to meet its anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled interest payments for the foreseeable future 
the credit facility contains several financial loan covenants  one of which in particular  the ebitda to interest ratio  is very sensitive to oil and natural gas price levels 
while the company is in compliance with this covenant at december   a continuation of low product prices in the future might jeopardize this ratio 
the company has been considering several alternatives to reduce this risk  including the acquisition or drilling of higher cash flow producing properties shorter reserve life to somewhat offset its long lived reserve base or monetizing certain non strategic assets 
in the normal course of business  the company reviews opportunities for the possible acquisition of oil and gas reserves and activities related thereto 
when potential acquisition opportunities are deemed consistent with the company s growth strategy  bids or offers in amounts and with terms acceptable to the company may be submitted 
it is uncertain whether any such bids or offers which may be submitted by the company would be acceptable to the sellers 
in the event of a future significant acquisition  the company may require additional financing in connection therewith 
inflation and changes in prices during  the company experienced some inflation in oil and gas prices with moderate increases in property acquisition and development costs 
during  the company received significantly lower oil prices and slightly lower gas prices for the natural resources produced from its properties 
in  the company experienced a further erosion of prices of for oil and gas 
due to the severity of the decline in prices  the company experienced a loss from the write down of its full cost pool 
the results of operations and cash flow of the company have been  and will continue to be  affected by the volatility in oil and gas prices 
should the company experience a significant increase in oil and gas prices that is sustained over a prolonged period  it would expect that there would also be a corresponding increase in oil and gas finding costs  lease acquisition costs  and operating expenses 
periodically the company enters into futures  options  and swap contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuations in crude oil and gas prices 
it is policy of the company not to enter into any such arrangements which exceed of the company s oil and gas production during the next months 
subsequent to year end  oil prices rose while gas prices declined slightly 
the company markets oil and gas for its own account  which exposes the company to the attendant commodities risk 
a substantial portion of the company s gas production is currently sold to ngts  llc or end users either on the spot market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or under long term contracts based on current spot market prices 
the company normally sells its oil under month to month contracts to a variety of purchasers 
hedging activity periodically  the company enters into futures  options  and swap contracts to mitigate the effects of significant fluctuations in crude oil and gas prices 
at december   the company had the following open contracts type volume month duration avg 
price oil collar  bbl jan dec floor cap call option 
 bbl jan dec gas swap  mmbtu jan mar swap  mmbtu apr oct collar  mmbtu jan mar floor cap call option 
 mmbtu jan mar net gains and losses related to derivative transactions for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
at december   the unrealized gain from derivative transactions was  year compliance year issues relate to the ability of computer programs or equipment to accurately calculate  store or use dates after december  these dates can be handled or interpreted in a number of different ways  but the most common errors are for the system to contain a two digit year which may cause the system to interpret the year as or  and the system will not recognize the year as a leap year 
errors such as these can result in system failures  miscalculations and the disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
in response to the year issues  the company has developed a strategic plan divided into the following phases inventory  product compliance based on vendor representations and in house testing  third party integration and development of a contingency plan 
all of the company s processing needs are handled by third party systems  none of which have been substantially modified and all of which have been purchased or upgraded within the last few years 
therefore  the company s initial review of its in house systems with regard to year issues required an inventory of its systems and a review of the vendor representations 
the company has completed this initial review of its information systems  various types of equipment and non information technology have also been reviewed  and based on vendor representations  are either compliant  will be compliant with the next forthcoming software release or are systems that are not date specific 
the company s non information technology consists primarily of various oil and gas exploration and production equipment 
the initial review has established that the primary non information technology systems functions are either not date sensitive or are year compliant based on vendor representations  and are therefore predicted to operate in customary manners when faced with year issues 
however  the company has determined that in the event such systems are unable to address the year  employees can manually perform most  if not all  functions 
in anticipation of year issues  the company is also evaluating the year readiness status of its third party service suppliers 
in addition to reviewing year readiness statements issued by the third parties handling the company s processing needs  to date the company has received and is relying upon  year readiness reports periodically issued by its financial services and electrical service providers  vendors and purchasers of the company s oil and natural gas products 
the company is continuing to review year readiness of third party service suppliers and based on their representations  does not currently foresee material disruptions in the company s business as a result of year issues 
unanticipated prolonged losses of certain services  such as electrical power  could cause material disruptions for which no economically feasible contingency plan has been developed 
the company is continuing to conduct in house testing of the core systems and non information technology  and to date either all systems tested have adequately addressed possible year scenarios or the company has a plan in place to remedy the deficiency 
the company expects testing to be completed during the second quarter of after the completion of its year review and testing  the company will further develop a contingency plan as required  including replacing or upgrading by december  any system incapable of addressing the year correctly 
this final step is expected to be completed during the third quarter of although the effects of year issues cannot be predicted with certainty  the company believes that the potential impact  if any  of such events will  at most  require employees to manually complete otherwise automated tasks or calculations  other than those which might occur in a worst case scenario as described below  which the company does not anticipate will occur 
after considering year effects on in house operations  the company expects a minimal level of additional training would be required to perform these tasks on a manual basis due to the level of experience of its personnel and the routine nature of the tasks being performed 
if  based on the results of its in house testing  the company should determine that certain systems are not year compliant and it appears as though the system is not likely to be compliant within a reasonable time period  the company will either elect to perform the task manually or will attempt to purchase a different system for that particular task and convert before december  the company does not believe that either option would impact the company s ability to continue exploration drilling  production or sales activities  although the tasks may require additional time and personnel to complete the same functions or may require incremental time and personnel during for a conversion to a new system 
the company s core business consists primarily of oil and gas acquisitions  development and exploration activities 
the equipment that is deemed mission critical to the company s activities requires external power sources such as electricity supplied by third parties 
although the company maintains limited on site secondary power sources such as generators  it is not economically feasible to maintain secondary power supplies for any major component of its mission critical equipment 
therefore  the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario for the company would involve a disruption of third party supplied electrical power  which would result in a substantial decrease in the company s oil production 
such event could result in a business interruption that could materially affect the company s operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company has initiated the third party integration phase and will continue to have formal communications with its significant suppliers  business partners and key customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to either the third parties or its own failure to correct their year issues 
the company has been communicating with such third parties to keep them informed of the company s internal assessment of its year review and plans 
this portion of the review and discussions with third parties is expected to be completed during the second quarter of to date  approximately three quarters of these third parties have provided certain favorable representations as to their year readiness and received similar representations from the company 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that the conversion will be compatible with the company s systems 
however  after reviewing and estimating the effects of such events  the company s contingency plan involves identifying and arranging for other vendors  purchasers and third party contractors to provide such services  if necessary  in order to maintain its normal operations 
the company has  and will continue to  utilize both internal and external resources to complete tasks and perform testing necessary to address the year issue 
the company has not incurred  and does not anticipate that it will incur  any significant costs relating to the assessment and remediation of year issues 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 which will be effective for the company s fiscal year  requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in fair value be reported in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of the statement on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk energy swap agreements 
the company engages in futures contracts with certain of its production through various contracts swap agreements 
the company considers these contracts to be hedging activities and  as such  monthly settlements on these contracts are reflected in oil and gas sales 
in order to consider these contracts as hedges  i the company must designate the contract as a hedge of future production and ii the contract must reduce the company s exposure to the risk of changes in prices 
changes in the market value of contracts treated as hedges are not recognized in income until the hedged item is also recognized in income 
if the above criteria are not met  the company will record the market value of the contract at the end of the month and recognize a related gain or loss 
proceeds received or paid relating to terminated contracts or contracts that have been sold are amortized over the original contract period and reflected in oil and gas sales 
the company enters into hedging activities in order to secure an acceptable future price relating to a portion of future production 
the primary objective of these activities is to protect against decreases in price during the term of the hedge 
the swap agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet oil and the inside ferc natural gas index price posting index 
the company has contracts which contain specific contracted prices swaps that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract prices and the specified index prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the index exceeds the contract price  the company pays the spread  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the index price the company receives the spread 
in addition  the company has combined contracts which have agreed upon price floors and ceilings costless collars 
to the extent the index price exceeds the contract ceiling  the company pays the spread between the ceiling and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the contract floor exceeds the index  the company receives the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the company receives the spread between the contract floor and the index price applies to related contract volumes  the company has a credit risk in the event of nonperformance of the counterparty to the agreement 
the company does not anticipate any material impact to its results of operations as a result of nonperformance by such parties 
at march   the company had the following open contracts type volume month duration avg
