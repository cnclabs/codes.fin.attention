increases in collaborative revenues were primarily due to the expansion as of april  of the pfizer anaderm program  for the discovery and development of cosmeceuticals  pharmacologically active compounds for use in certain cosmetic and quality of life indications 
this agreement could result in up to million in total payments to the company over a year period 
the new research agreement with solvay  which also contributed to the increase in collaborative revenues  was acquired on july  with the acquisition of certain assets from cadus 
this program is directed toward gpcr drug discovery in the cardiovascular field 
collaborative revenues were partially offset by the conclusion in october of one of the company s funded collaborative programs with hmri relating to the discovery and development of orally active drugs for the treatment of chronic anemia 
sales revenue  representing service revenue from the company s aston and osdi subsidiaries  increased approximately  or compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the growth in sales of the company s diagnostic tests 
other research revenue  representing primarily government grants and other research grants  decreased approximately  or compared to the prior fiscal year 
this is related to a reduction in the number of government grants received 
osi has narrowed its grant applications to its disease areas of focus in order to more fully leverage its resources 
license revenue increased approximately million or compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily related to a million fee resulting from a license agreement entered into in march  with biochem pharma  which replaces an earlier collaborative program focused on anti viral drug discovery 
under the terms of the agreement  the company is licensing to biochem pharma rights to the company s joint technology in certain anti viral targets 
in addition to the licensing fee  the company will receive milestones and royalties based upon biochem pharma s successful development of drugs arising from leads discovered in the program 
during fiscal  the company recognized license revenue of approximately  from the signing of a license agreement with aurora biosciences covering the company s gene transcription patent estate 
the increase in total revenues of approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to the commencement on october  of the funded phase of the collaborative research and license agreement among the company  anaderm and pfizer as well as an increased level of research in the collaborative program with sankyo to discover and develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat influenza which commenced in february  this increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in revenues related to the company s collaborative program with hmri to discover and develop small molecules that induce gene expression of the protein erythropoietin 
this decrease in revenues was attributable to the company s receipt of a million initiation fee from hmri for the erythropoietin  or epo  program in fiscal and reduced funding in connection with the extension of the first phase of this program in april  the epo program did not achieve sufficient positive data to warrant further development 
consequently  in october   this program was terminated 
the increase in revenue was also offset by the completion in fiscal of the funded discovery phase of the company s collaborative program with wyeth ayerst laboratories relating to the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of diabetes and osteoporosis

the company has also acquired cadus directed library of  small molecule compounds specifically designed for drug discovery in the gpcr area 
the company recorded a charge of  for in process r d acquired in connection with the cadus asset acquisition which is included in r d expense in fiscal also contributing to the increase in research and development expense is the continued expansion of the company s collaboration with anaderm for the discovery and development of novel compounds to treat pigmentation disorders  wrinkles and baldness 
the company also expanded its medicinal chemistry facility at its aston subsidiary in the united kingdom to accommodate the increased chemistry efforts required in the expanded anaderm collaboration 
these costs were somewhat offset by the conclusion in october  of the company s funded collaborative program with hmri relating to the discovery and development of orally active drugs for the treatment of chronic anemia 
the increase in r d expenses in fiscal was due to the expansion of the company s collaboration with anaderm and the collaborative agreement with sankyo for the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products to treat influenza

on july   the company acquired certain assets from cadus for approximately million in cash which included professional fees and other costs and the assumption of certain liabilities 
forty seven cadus employees were hired by the company 
the company intends to utilize the acquired assets in the gpcr directed drug discovery program and the collaboration with solvay  but expects to deploy the balance of the assets in other research areas 
the company also assumed cadus facility lease in tarrytown  new york approximately  square feet as of july  approximately  in rental payments per annum through december  and an equipment lease with general electric capital corporation gecc 
on august   the company elected to payoff the gecc lease in exchange for a payment of million and obtained ownership of the fixed assets covered by the lease agreement 
on september   cadus reimbursed the company  in exchange for those fixed assets that have been retained by cadus for its own use 
the source of the cash portion of the purchase price and the subsequent decision to payoff the lease agreement with gecc was the company s existing cash resources 
liabilities and facility lease obligation assumed will be paid from existing cash resources and working capital to be generated in future periods 
the company is dependent upon collaborative research revenues  government research grants  interest income and cash balances  and will remain so until products developed from its technology are successfully commercialized 
the company believes that with the funding from its collaborative research programs  government research grants  interest income  and cash balances  its financial resources are adequate for its operations for approximately the next three years based on its current business plan even if no milestone payments or royalties are received during this period 
however  the company s capital requirements may vary as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  competitive and technological developments  funds required for further expansion or enhancement of the company s technology platform  including possible additional joint ventures  collaborations and acquisitions  potential milestone payments  and the time and expense required to obtain governmental approval of products  some of which factors are beyond the company s control 
one of the company s strategic objectives is to manage its financial resources and the growth of its drug discovery and development programs so as to balance its proprietary efforts and funded collaborations 
in pursuing this objective  the company in fiscal expanded the scope of its discovery and development activities without significantly increasing its rate of cash consumption 
the company expects to continue its current level of expenditures and capital investment over the next several years to enhance its drug discovery platform and pursue internal proprietary drug discovery programs 
there can be no assurance that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that government research grants will continue to be received at current levels  that milestone payments will be made  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any additional required funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain additional funds when required would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
yk the company is aware of the challenges associated with the inability of certain systems to properly format information after december  the company has worked to resolve the potential impact of the yk problem on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the yk problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define an applicable year 
substantially all of the company s biology and chemistry databases are stored on oracle tables and isis chemical structure databases  which are yk compliant  as are its novell network servers 
the company has completed the conversion of its financial records to an oracle based system which is yk compliant 
the company expects these systems to be operational on december  the company believes it has fully remediated its yk programs and does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as the result of any failure by the company to fully remediate such programs 
to date  the company has not incurred any significant costs in addressing the yk problem 
based on current information  the cost of addressing remaining potential yk problems associated with the company s internal systems and operations are not expected to have a material adverse impact to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows in future periods 
the company has conducted an evaluation of the extent to which the operations of the material third parties with whom it regularly deals may be disrupted by any yk non compliance of any of their systems 
these third parties include the company s collaborative partners and its suppliers and vendors 
disruption of the operations of any of its partners could delay or halt important research and development programs  cause the loss of data or have other unforeseen consequences 
the company has contacted significant collaborators  suppliers  vendors and financial institutions in order to identify potential areas of concern 
given the responses it has received from suppliers and vendors  the company has not deemed it necessary to seek alternative suppliers or vendors 
if the company determines to seek other alternative suppliers or vendors in the future because of the current suppliers or venders inability to assure yk compliance  the company may not be able to find adequate replacements 
yk problems experienced by the company s suppliers and vendors could cause a disruption of the company s operations 
the company currently is unable to estimate the likelihood of any of these risks being realized  or if realized  the impact they may have on the company 
the company has developed a contingency plan with respect to electric power which the company believes would most significantly affect its research activity and operations 
the company s ability to conduct its r d programs and to function as a viable business enterprise  however  depends on the continued availability of these basic infrastructure systems
