item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion which follows analyzes suffolk bancorp s the company or suffolk operations for each of the past three years  and its financial condition as of december  and  respectively 
selected tabular data are presented for each of the past five years 
suffolk s business nearly all of suffolk s business is to provide banking services to its commercial and retail customers in suffolk county  on long island  new york

other investments are made in short term united states treasury debt  high quality obligations of municipalities in new york state  issues of agencies of the united states government  collateralized mortgage obligations and stock in the federal reserve bank and the federal home loan bank of new york required as a condition of membership 
the bank finances most of its activities with deposits  including demand  savings  now  and money market accounts  as well as term certificates 
to a much lesser degree  it relies on other short term sources of funds  including interbank overnight loans and  when needed  sale repurchase agreements 
general economic conditions growth in long island s economy was steady during increased demand for finance  information  transportation and tourism were offset by layoffs resulting from corporate consolidations and down sizing 
long island has a highly educated and skilled work force  and a diverse industrial base 
it is adjacent to new york city  one of the world s largest centers of distribution and a magnet for finance and culture 
the island s economic cycles vary from those of the national economy 
during  interest rates were stable throughout the year  and there was less difference between short and long term rates than in previous years 
results of operations net income net income was  compared to  last year and  in these represents increases of percent and percent respectively 
basic earnings per share were compared to  last year and in net interest income net interest income during was  up percent from  and up percent from  in and  respectively 
net interest income is the most important part of the net income of suffolk

the rate used for this adjustment was approximately for federal income taxes and for new york state income taxes for all periods 
for each of the years  and  of nontaxable income from obligations of states and political subdivisions equates to fully taxable income of 
in addition  in  and  of nontaxable income on us treasury securities equates to of fully taxable income 
the amortization of loan fees is included in interest income 
analysis of changes in net interest income the table below presents a summary of changes in interest income  interest expense and the resulting net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods presented  each as compared with the preceding period 
because of numerous  simultaneous changes in volume and rate during the period  it is not possible to allocate precisely the changes between volumes and rates 
in this table changes not due solely to volume or to rate have been allocated to these categories based on percentage changes in average volume and average rate as they compare to each other in thousands in over in over changes due to changes due to volume rate net change volume rate net change interest earning assets us treasury us  obligations of states political subdivisions us govt

these securities are suffolk s primary source of liquidity 
these balances decreased as funds were shifted into government agency issues as the spread between treasury and agency yields widened during the period 
us treasury  us government agency  and municipal securities provide collateral for various liabilities to municipal depositors

loan portfolio loans  net of unearned discounts  but before the allowance for possible loan losses totaled  consumer loans are the largest component of the suffolk s loan portfolio 
net of unearned discounts  they totaled  at the end of  up percent from  at the year end consumer loans include primarily indirect  dealer generated automobile loans 
competition among commercial banks  and with captive finance companies of automobile manufacturers has limited yields 
commercial real estate mortgages closed the year at  up percent from  last year 
commercial and industrial loans followed at  up percent from  at the end of as commerce on long island continued to expand  both commercial mortgages and loans offered the greatest opportunity for growth  although competition forced concessions on rates in order to maintain the quality of the suffolk s commercial portfolio 
these loans are made to small local businesses throughout suffolk county 
loan balances are seasonal  particularly in the hamptons where retail inventories rise in the spring and fall by autumn 
the remaining  significant components of the loan portfolio are residential mortgages at  up percent from  home equity loans at  down percent from  and construction loans at  up percent from  the following table categorizes total loans net of unearned discounts at december in thousands commercial  financial agricultural loans      commercial real estate mortgages      real estate construction loans      residential mortgages st and nd liens      home equity loans      consumer loans      lease finance other loans      total loans net of unearned discounts      non performing loans generally  recognition of interest income is discontinued where reasonable doubt exists as to whether interest can be collected 
ordinarily  loans no longer accrue interest when days past due 
when a loan stops accruing interest  all interest accrued in the current year  but not collected  is reversed against interest income in the current year 
any interest accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for possible loan losses 
loans start accruing interest again when they become current as to principal and interest  and when  in the opinion of management  they can be collected in full 
all non performing loans  of a material amount  are reflected in the foregoing tables 
the following table shows non accrual  past due  and restructured loans at december in thousands loans accruing but past due contractually days or more     loans not accruing interest      restructured loans total      interest on loans that are restructured or are no longer accruing interest would have amounted to about  for under the contractual terms of those loans 
suffolk records the payment of interest on such loans as a reduction of principal 
interest income recognized on restructured and non accrual loans was immaterial for the years  and suffolk has a formal procedure for internal credit review to more precisely identify risk and exposure in the loan portfolio 
summary of loan losses and allowances for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is determined by continuous analysis of the loan portfolio 
that analysis includes changes in the size and composition of the portfolio  historical loan losses  industry wide losses  current and anticipated economic trends  and details about individual loans 
it also includes estimates of the actual value of collateral and other possible sources of repayment 
there can be no assurance that the allowance is  in fact  adequate 
when a loan or part of is deemed uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
this happens when it is well past due  and the borrower has not shown the ability or intent to make the loan current  or the borrower does not have enough assets to pay the debt  or the value of the collateral is less than the balance of the loan and not likely to improve in the near future 
residential real estate and consumer loans are not analyzed individually because of the large number of loans  small balances  and historically low losses 
in the future  the provision for loan losses may change as a percentage of total loans 
the percentage of net charge offs to average net loans during was  compared to percent in  and percent during the ratio of the allowance for possible loan losses to loans  net of discounts  was percent at the end of  percent in  and percent in the allowance for possible loan losses has seven major categories 
a summary of transactions follows in thousands year ended december  allowance for possible loan losses  january allowance acquired from hamptons  loans charged off commercial  financial agricultural loans commercial real estate mortgages real estate construction loans residential mortgages st and nd liens home equity loans consumer loans lease finance other loans total charge offs    year ended december  loans recovered after being charged off commercial  financial agricultural loans commercial real estate mortgages real estate construction loans residential mortgages st and nd liens home equity loans consumer loans lease finance other loans total recoveries net loans charged off  provision for possible loan losses   allowance for possible loan losses  december the following table presents information concerning loan balances and asset quality dollars in thousands year ended december  loans  net of discounts average      at end of period      non performing assets total loans net of discounts non performing assets total assets ratio of net charge offs average net loans net charge offs net loans at december  allowance for possible loan losses loans  net of discounts the disparity between average net loans and net loans at december  is mostly attributable to the acquisition of hampton s portfolio of loans 
interest expense interest expense in was  up percent from  the year before  which was up percent from  during most interest was paid for the deposits of individuals  businesses  and various governments and their agencies 
short term borrowings  including federal funds purchased short term lending by other banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and federal reserve bank borrowings were used occasionally 
short term borrowings averaged  during   during and  during deposits average interest bearing deposits increased to  in  up percent from  in savings  now and money market deposits decreased during  averaging  down percent from when they averaged  average time certificates of less than  totaled  up percent from  in average time certificates of  or more totaled  up percent from  during average average average average rate paid average rate paid average rate paid demand deposits    savings deposits    now money market now    time certificates of  or more    other time deposits    total deposits    the following table classifies average deposits for each of the periods indicated in thousands at december   the remaining maturities of time certificates of  or more were as follows in thousands months or less  over through months  over through months  over months total  short term borrowings occasionally  suffolk uses short term funding 
this includes lines of credit for federal funds with correspondent banks  retail sale repurchase agreements  and the federal reserve bank discount window

average balances of federal reserve bank borrowings were none during and  during retail repurchase agreements averaged  during and  during there were none outstanding during other income other income increased to  during  up percent from  during and up percent  during service charges on deposit accounts were down percent from to  and up percent from to other service charges were up and for the same periods 
fiduciary fees in totaled  up percent from when they amounted to  and up percent from  when they amounted to  other expense other expense during was  up percent from when it was  up percent from  in during  equipment and other operating expense increased as the result of a conversion to a new  client server core data processing system during the first quarter 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is determined by the date when each asset and liability in suffolk s portfolio can be repriced 
sensitivity increases when the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities cannot be repriced at the same time 
while this analysis presents the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each period of time  it does not consider how quickly various assets and liabilities might actually be repriced in response to changes in interest rates 
management reviews its interest rate sensitivity regularly and adjusts its asset liability strategy accordingly 
because the interest rates of assets and liabilities vary according to their maturity  management may selectively mismatch the repricing of assets and liabilities to take advantage of temporary or projected differences between short and long term interest rates 
the following table reflects the sensitivity of suffolk s assets and liabilities at december  dollars in thousands less than to to more than not rate months months months one year sensitive total interest earning assets maturity domestic loans net of unearned discount       investment securities       federal funds sold   total interest earning assets       demand deposits and interest bearing liabilities demand deposits      now money market now      interest bearing deposits      total demand deposits interest bearing liabilities      gap       cumulative difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities      cumulative difference total assets based on contractual maturity  instrument repricing date  if applicable  projected prepayments and prepayments of principal experience 
based on contractual maturity  and projected prepayments based on experience 
frb and fhlb stock is not considered rate sensitive based on contractual maturity 
based on experience of historical stable core deposit relationships 
now and money market accounts are assumed to decline over a period of five years 
fixed rate deposits and deposits with fixed pricing intervals are reflected as maturing in the period of contractual maturity assumed to decline over a period of five years 
as of december   interest earning assets with maturities of less than one year exceed interest bearing liabilities of similar maturity 
this cumulative gap might result in increased net interest income if interest rates increase 
if interest rates decline  net interest income might decrease 
market risk market risk is the risk that a financial instrument will lose value as the result of adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  or the prices of equity securities 
suffolk s primary exposure to market risk is to changing interest rates 
monitoring and managing this risk is an important part of suffolk s asset liability management process 
it is governed by policies established by its board of directors 
these policies are reviewed and approved annually 
the board delegates responsibility for asset liability management to the asset liability committee alco 
alco then develops guidelines and strategies to implement the policy 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  interest income and expense also change  thereby changing net interest income nii 
nii is the primary component of suffolk s earnings 
alco uses a detailed and dynamic model to quantify the effect of sustained changes in interest rates on nii 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity two years into the future  it uses other tools to monitor longer term interest rate risk 
the model measures the effect of changing interest rates on both interest income and interest expense for all assets and liabilities  as well as for derivative financial instruments that do not appear on the balance sheet 
the results are compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum effect on nii one year in the future  assuming no growth in assets or liabilities  and a percent of basis point bp change in interest rates  either upward or downward 
following is suffolk s nii sensitivity as of december  suffolk s board has approved a policy limit of 
rate change estimated nii bp bp this estimate should not be interpreted as suffolk s forecast  and should not be considered as indicative of management s expectations for operating results 
these are hypothetical estimates which are based on many assumptions including the nature and time of changes in interest rates  the shape of the yield curve variations in interest rates for financial instruments of varying maturity at a given moment in time  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit outflows  pricing on loans and deposits  the reinvestment of cash flows from assets and liabilities  among others 
while these assumptions are based on management s best estimate of current economic conditions  suffolk cannot give any assurance that these will actually predict results  nor can they anticipate how the behavior of customers and competitors may change in the future 
factors which may affect actual results include prepayment and refinancing of loans other than as assumed  interest rate change caps and floors  repricing intervals on adjustable rate instruments  changes in debt service on adjustable rate loans  and early withdrawal of deposits 
actual results may also be affected by actions alco takes in response to changes in interest rates  actual or anticipated 
when appropriate  alco may use off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its position with regard to interest rate risk 
the board directors has approved a hedging policy statement that governs the use of such instruments 
as of december   there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding

the committee includes two outside directors  executive management  the comptroller  and the heads of commercial lending  retail lending  and retail banking 
it uses computer simulations to quantify interest rate risk and to project liquidity 
the simulations also help the committee to develop contingent strategies to increase net interest income 
the committee always assesses the impact of any change in strategy on suffolk s ability to make loans and repay deposits 
only strategies and policies that meet regulatory guidelines  and which are appropriate under the economic and competitive circumstances are considered by the committee 
suffolk has not used forward contracts or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
readiness for the year suffolk has established a formal program to identify and assess the effect of the year on its software  hardware  and suffolk s business 
much of suffolk s data processing is done by outside vendors  and suffolk is dependent on them to evaluate and address problems that may arise when computers cannot distinguish between the years with the same final two digits in the current century and in the next 
management believes that these vendors will modify both software and hardware to accommodate the change in both the century and the millennium before they cause problems 
however  if one or more of them fail to do so  it could have an adverse effect on suffolk s operations 
at this time  however  management does not expect that the expense of modifying systems to identify the year correctly will have a significant effect on suffolk s results of operation  financial condition or liquidity  now or in the future 
suffolk has identified ways in which the year yk may affect its operations 
suffolk s readiness 
suffolk is in the final phase of its evaluation and improvement of its internal information systems 
during the first quarter  suffolk converted its core processing systems including loans  deposits  and general ledger to a state of the art distributed client server system which is fully ready for yk 
various accounting subsystems non core have been evaluated  and all modifications were made by december  as a banking corporation  suffolk relies mainly on its information systems to conduct business 
management does not expect that technology embedded in microprocessors which may not work properly after the year to have a material effect on suffolk s operations or profitability 
cost to address yk 
management expects the cost of evaluating and modifying systems in preparation for the year to be approximately  for risk of yk 
management at suffolk believes that it has made provision for its systems to continue processing information correctly through and beyond the year management has also confirmed  in writing  that key providers of information have also made proper provision 
however  suffolk has no control over the readiness of major utilities and communications networks 
in the opinion of management  the failure of such outside services presents the greatest risk to suffolk of yk problems 
contingency plan 
as a matter of standard practice  suffolk maintains a disaster recovery plan which is reviewed and updated annually 
while suffolk has no means of accurately measuring risk to the systems of major utilities and communications networks  its disaster recovery plan assumes that these systems may fail  both for reasons related to yk  as well as for other reasons  and makes provision for operations to continue without them  albeit with reduced efficiency 
assessment of suffolk s readiness 
suffolk s readiness for yk has been and continues to be evaluated by its management 
it will also be evaluated by its primary banking regulator  the office of the comptroller of the currency 
capital resources primary capital  including stockholders equity  not including the net unrealized gain on securities available for sale  net of tax  and the allowance for possible loan losses  amounted to  compared to  at year end and  at year end during  suffolk repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of  management determined that this would increase leverage while preserving capital ratios well above regulatory requirements 
the following table presents suffolk s capital ratio  and other related ratios  for each of the last five years dollars in thousands primary capital at year end      primary capital at year end as a percentage of year end total assets plus allowance for possible loan losses loans  net of unearned discounts total deposits capital ratios do not include the effect of sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and investment securities 
suffolk measures how effectively it uses capital by two widely accepted performance ratios return on average assets and return on average common stockholders equity 
the returns in on average assets of percent and average common equity of percent increased from when returns were percent and percent  respectively 
all dividends must conform to applicable statutory requirements 
suffolk bancorp s ability to pay dividends depends on the suffolk county national bank s ability to pay dividends 
under usc  a national bank may not pay a dividend on its common stock if the dividend would exceed net undivided profits then on hand 
further  under usc  a national bank must obtain prior approval from the office of the comptroller of the currency to pay dividends on either common or preferred stock that would exceed the bank s net profits for the current year combined with retained net profits net profits minus dividends paid during that period of the prior two years 
the amount currently available is approximately  risk based capital and leverage guidelines the federal reserve bank s risk based capital guidelines call for bank holding companies to require minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets  which include certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit 
the guidelines define capital as being core  or tier  capital  which includes common stockholders equity  a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  minority interest in unconsolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  or supplementary or tier capital which includes subordinated debt  redeemable preferred stock  and a limited amount of the allowance for possible loan losses 
all bank holding companies must meet a minimum ratio of total qualifying capital to risk weighted assets of percent  of which at least percent should be in the form of tier capital 
at december   suffolk s ratios of core capital and total qualifying capital core capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets were percent and percent  respectively 
discussion of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for the bank on january  and will not impact the bank s accounting or disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement conforms to the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans by a mortgage banking enterprise with the subsequent accounting for securities retained after the securitization of other types of assets by a non mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  it is not expected to have a material effect on suffolk s operations
