results of operations revenues dollars in thousands increase increase decrease product sales food safety    animal safety    total revenues    the increase in sales of food safety products was primarily due to increases in sales in two areas 
large sections of the southern united states suffered from hot  dry weather conditions during the summer months  which promoted mold growth in corn and other commodity crops 
sales of test kits to detect aflatoxin  a harmful residue from molds that proliferate in hot  dry weather conditions  increased  during sales of test kits to detect harmful bacteria increased  in due to strong international demand and because of higher sales to meat processors concerned about well publicized e 
coli and listeria outbreaks in hamburger  hot dogs and luncheon meats 
in  food safety sales declined by 
sales of diagnostic test kits sold to the meat and poultry market for the detection of harmful bacteria increased by  however  sales of test kits to detect vomitoxin declined by  sales of diagnostic tests for the detection of harmful naturally occurring toxins  such as vomitoxin and aflatoxin  are influenced by the uncertainty of weather conditions  which impacts growing conditions differently each year 
accordingly  it is not uncommon for the company to experience significant year to year fluctuations in sales of test kits to detect naturally occurring toxins 
animal safety sales increased in and in the acquisitions of vetoquinol usa  inc effective december  and triple crown  effective july  contributed  and  in increased sales in and  respectively 
other products experiencing increased demand in included the company s vaccine to prevent type b botulism in horses  and sales of oem products such as specialty needles and syringes used to inject spices and marinades into meat and poultry

cost of goods sold dollars in thousands increase increase cost of goods sold    costs of goods sold increased in and in principally due to the overall increase in product sales 
expressed as a percent of sales  cost of goods sold was  and in   and respectively 
the percentages for and are higher than due exclusively to a higher mix of animal safety sales in and compared to operating expenses dollars in thousands increase increase sales and marketing    general administrative    research and development    many sales and marketing expense categories increased in and including salaries  fringe  royalties  commissions  trade shows and technical service 
the increase in compared to is the direct result of expanding sales activities both domestically and internationally to gain wider distribution of products dedicated to food and animal safety 
the company expects to continue to expand its sales and marketing efforts in the future 
the increase from to was primarily due to higher costs  including the acquisitions of vetoquinol  usa  inc  and triple crown  associated with marketing products to the professional equine market 
the increase in general and administrative expense is due to two factors 
increases in sales volume and overall business activity resulted in a need for additional administrative staff 
the increase in staff  along with higher accruals for bonuses due to improved operating performance  resulted in  of higher salary and fringe expense 
in addition  legal and professional fees increased  compared to the majority of the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal was the result of higher cost in two categories 
consulting expense was  higher due primarily to contract services associated with a new computer installation  increased consulting pertaining to manufacturing and approvals for professional equine products  and also because of management consulting pertaining to the company s research efforts and manufacturing protocols for diagnostic tests to detect harmful bacteria 
in addition  legal and professional fees increased  compared to management believes that the company is not involved in any material adverse legal proceedings 
however  neogen is a party in lawsuits as discussed in item legal proceedings in this form k 
management intends to vigorously pursue this litigation and cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits 
furthermore  the company has no way to predict the level of expenses that may be incurred in fiscal year in pursuing this litigation 
the company expects general and administrative expenses to decline in fiscal year partially as a result of consolidating certain administrative functions and partially because management believes that legal fees will be lower in than research expenses increased in and due primarily to increased staffing levels 
management believes research and development is critical to the company s future and expects to continue to expand efforts for research products pertaining to food and animal safety products 
other income dollars in thousands decrease increase other income other income declined significantly in this was primarily due to the loss on sale of the company s human clinical product line and related fourth quarter charge for closure of a manufacturing facility  which totaled approximately  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  interest income decreased during due to lower rates and lower average investment balances 
other income was  higher in compared to during fiscal  the company completed a public offering of common stock 
a portion of the proceeds was used to pay down short term bank borrowings  resulting in lower interest expense 
the remaining proceeds were invested in short term marketable securities  which resulted in higher interest income 
also  the company s share of royalties  paid to an affiliated partnership  increased significantly in net income and income per share dollars in thousands increase increase net income    net income per share diluted during  the company s operating income increased by  or as a direct result of the overall increase in product sales 
this substantial increase in operating income was offset by much lower other income in and by a significant increase in federal income taxes 
neogen s effective federal tax rate has historically been insignificant because the company had net operating loss carry forwards nols available to offset taxable income 
during fiscal year the company utilized its remaining nols 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate increased significantly in compared to and management expects the effective federal tax rate will also increase in fiscal year the increase in net income and net income per share over was due primarily to the increase in sales of animal safety products  including acquisitions  along with the increase in other income

during  the company initiated programs focused on reducing investment in accounts receivable and inventories 
as a result  accounts receivable were up only while inventories declined at may  despite a significant increase in sales and production volume 
the significant increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is the result of  in prepaid federal income taxes and a  short term note receivable obtained as part of the company s sale of its human clinical product line 
the decrease in goodwill at may  from may  is principally due to  of goodwill written off as part of with the sale of the company s human clinical product line see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the substantial increase in other non current assets is partially due to a  note receivable obtained in conjunction with the aforementioned sale of the human clinical product line and partially due to the acquisition of certain assets of bioport corporation

at may  the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation and changing prices have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s operations 
neogen has been profitable for of its last quarters and has generated positive cash flows from operations during this period 
management believes that the company s existing cash and marketable securities at may   along with its available bank lines of credit and cash expected to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to fund activities for the foreseeable future 
however  existing cash and marketable securities may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire additional technology and products that fit within the company s mission statement 
accordingly  the company may be required to issue equity securities or enter into other financing arrangements for a portion of the company s future capital needs 
year the company began addressing the year issue in the first half of calendar year an inventory and assessment of the company s hardware and software computer systems was conducted including an analysis of accounting  office and security systems along with a review of manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
in addition  the company surveyed key customers and vendors regarding their strategies to achieve year compliance 
as a result of this assessment  the company determined that the financial software used at its subsidiary where veterinary instruments are manufactured was not year compliant 
programming changes to correct this problem were completed and tested in july accordingly  the company be lieves that its financial and manufacturing systems are year compliant 
the company is currently in the process of developing contingency plans to prepare for potential year problems that might occur due to unforeseen factors including incorrect assumptions  changes in available information or failure of third parties to adequately address the year issue 
these contingency plans may include purchasing and redeployment to various locations of additional materials and supplies  preservation of perishable biological products and antibodies in the event of electrical power interruptions  and processing of customer orders and vendor invoices manually 
the company expects that the total cost of changes necessary to comply with year will not exceed  including costs already incurred to date 
however  the company is basing this cost estimate  and its belief that it is currently year compliant  on presently available information and assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from materially the company s expectations as a result of numerous factors  including the possibility of incorrect assumptions  cooperation of third parties and other unforeseen circumstances that could have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial results
