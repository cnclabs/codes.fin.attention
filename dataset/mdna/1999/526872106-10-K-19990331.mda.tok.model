year compliance the year issue concerns the potential inability of computer hardware or software to properly recognize date sensitive information relating to the year and beyond 
to address this potential problem  the company has implemented a work plan to identify information systems issues and has surveyed each manufacturing location to identify mission critical and support function system compliance issues 
the company has assessed potential risks that could impact the company s business and is developing appropriate contingency plans in the event of a temporary disruption 
the company s vice president  chief information officer leads this effort 
since  the company has conducted a broad based information systems program to replace and upgrade computer application software and hardware in its manufacturing  distribution  point of sale  financial and administrative functions 
the primary purpose of this program is to improve operating efficiencies 
with the implementation of a new receivables management system in  the company expects to complete this broad based information systems program by the end of at the time of purchase of these new systems from various vendors  the company required that these systems be year compliant 
the company has obtained written vendor representations as to the new systems year compliance 
it is the company s belief that these new information systems and the related hardware to operate these systems are compliant with year computing requirements 
during  the company completed construction of a new fertilizer manufacturing plant in sebring  florida 
it is the company s belief that all operating systems at this plant are year compliant 
during  the company conducted a review of each manufacturing site  and internal assessments with respect to year compliance for its desktop and manufacturing process technology and other potentially date sensitive technology

the incremental cost specifically associated with year compliance efforts has been nominal  and is expected to be less than  in the potential risks associated with the year issue include temporary disruption of manufacturing operations  materials ordering  receiving and shipping product  order entry  billing and collection of accounts receivable  and disruption in services from vendors who supply materials or services necessary to the company in the conduct of its operations 
while there can be no complete assurances  we believe the risk of disruption to the company has been minimized as a result of the information systems upgrades that have occurred since  the ongoing testing and assessments of operating systems  and the ongoing communication with key business partners 
however  if disruptions relating to the year issue occur  the company could experience some adverse effects on its operations
