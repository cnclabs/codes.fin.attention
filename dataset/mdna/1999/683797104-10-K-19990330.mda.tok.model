the securities industry is highly competitive and sensitive to many factors and is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including the volatility and price level of securities markets  the volume  size  and timing of securities transactions  the demand for investment banking services and changes in interest rates  all of which have an impact on commissions  trading and investment income as well as on liquidity 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary with market activity 
consequently  substantial fluctuations can occur in the company s revenues and net income from period to period due to these and other factors 
the company anticipates increasing competition from commercial banks and thrift institutions as these institutions begin to offer more investment banking and financial services traditionally only provided by securities firms 
the growing use of discount brokerage firms by investors has impacted traditional retail commission business and the presence of on line trading over the internet has begun to significantly impact the means by which retail clients place their orders 
the company is also experiencing increasing regulation in the securities industry  particularly affecting the over the counter markets  making compliance with regulations more difficult and costly

liquidity and capital resources the decrease in the company s assets in compared to has been primarily the result of the loss of fom investment executives following the acquisition of fom in july as a result of corporate raids  a significant number of fom investment executives and their clients left the fom organization

because of the company s strong financial condition  size and earnings history  management believes adequate sources of credit would be available to finance higher trading volumes  branch expansion  and major capital expenditures  as needed 
inflation because the assets of the company s brokerage subsidiaries are highly liquid  and because securities inventories are carried at current market values  the impact of inflation generally is reflected in the financial statements 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s costs relating to employee compensation  rent  communications and certain other operating costs  and such costs may not be recoverable in the level of commissions charged 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
year disclosure the year problem arises as the result of computer systems having been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the year during a period when data processing media put a high value on brevity of expression 
any computer  computer program  equipment or product that has date sensitive software or embedded chips  if not corrected  could produce inaccurate or unpredictable results commencing on january  the company is a broker dealer in securities and as such relies heavily on computer technology to conduct its operations 
the company relies on both internal systems and on third party vendors 
as at the date hereof  all vendors of software and hardware and all vendors of non critical systems elevators  vault  building security  etc 
have been contacted and inquiries about their yk readiness have been made 
certain non critical systems have been determined to be non yk compliant and have been or are being replaced with available yk compliant systems 
approximately of all vendors of mission critical vendors have responded and have indicated that they already are or will be compliant 
in terms of the company s internal systems  all programs have been assessed for year compliance 
the majority of the compilation work has been completed and substantially all remediated systems have been internally tested on a parallel basis with current production  using live files 
the remaining programs upon which modification work has not yet begun  represent less than of the total number of programs running at the company 
full testing and full year compliance is expected to be completed by june  the company is actively participating in a number of industry committees including the security industry association year committee 
the company validated its connections to various test sites in july and will participate in various industry wide year tests that are scheduled to run on saturdays beginning on march  to simulate december  through april  to simulate january  
files interfacing with siac and dtc have already been adapted and are compliant 
to date there have been no material exceptions in tests that have been completed 
the cost of program remediation and testing  readying the company for year has been estimated to be approximately   for fiscal this includes the costs associated with the personnel dedicated to the project 
the cost of new hardware has not been included as substantially all purchases are included in the general technology upgrade being made in connection with the roll out of new desk top systems company wide 
it is expected that similar costs would be required in fiscal this range of costs does not include normal ongoing costs for computer hardware or software revisions that would be required in the normal course of business

market risk market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
see additional discussion of risk management in item 
in addition  the company s activities expose it to operational risk  legal risk and funding risk

value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the securities and exchange commission s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows s omitted interest rate risk equity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio  more particularly an increase in the size of the company s debt portfolio and a decrease in the company s equity portfolio at december  compared to december  further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item  risk management 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions  or the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
