the company continued its aggressive drilling program in by drilling gross net wells 
the successful wells  including wells under evaluation at the end of  resulted in the addition of bcfe of proved developed producing reserves  replacing percent of production

for those oil and gas properties which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment was determined to exist  thus  the company adjusted the carrying amount of the respective oil and gas properties to their fair value as determined by discounting their estimated future cash flows 
the factors used to determine fair value included  but were not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures and a discount rate commensurate with the company s internal rate of return on its oil and gas properties

the company  from time to time  receives restitution for circumstances that inhibit mining reserves in a certain location 
the increase of percent from to was  in part  a result of new leases on the company s wise property primarily the virginia acreage formerly leased to westmoreland coal company 
these additional leases were signed in and early and produced an additional  tons from this property 
in early  the company also acquired additional coal reserves  which provided royalties on an additional  tons in operating expenses

other issues year historically  most computer systems  including microprocessors embedded into field equipment and other machinery  utilized software that recognized a calendar year by its last two digits 
beginning in the year  these systems will require modification to recognize a calendar year by four digits 
accordingly  the company continues to investigate the extent to which its currently installed information technology and non information technology systems will be affected by what is commonly known as the year problem and is implementing a plan to take reasonable steps to prevent its mission critical functions from being impaired by the year problem 
the phrase computer equipment and software includes what is commonly considered technology systems  including accounting  data processing  telephones and other systems 
non information technology systems include alarm systems  metering devices  monitors for field operation and other systems 
the company is utilizing resources to test  reprogram  modify and or replace both systems  as necessary 
evaluation  testing and replacement should be completed by july the company has also been inquiring and has received verbal or written assurances from the vast majority of its providers as to their progress in addressing year issues and that such providers expect to be year compliant in all material respects 
the company expects to complete communications with remaining providers by july based on information known at this time  the company expects to be year compliant in all material respects in a timely manner and does not believe that year compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total costs for the year compliance review  evaluation  assessment and remediation efforts are not expected to be in excess of  of this amount  less than  has been incurred through december  the company is in the initial stages of developing a year contingency plan 
the company believes a more comprehensive and effective contingency plan will be developed once potential concerns are evaluated and risk has been fully assessed 
the contingency plan  which is to be completed by october  will place the majority of its emphasis on primary concerns that would inhibit operations or record keeping 
the costs of year compliance and the dates on which the company plans to complete modifications and replacements are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  b a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years ending after june  with earlier application allowed as of the beginning of any quarter beginning after issuance

environmental matters penn virginia s operating segments are subject to various environmental hazards 
several federal  state and local laws  regulations and rules govern the environmental aspects of the company s business 
noncompliance with these laws  regulations and rules can result in substantial penalties or other liabilities 
the company does not believe its environmental risks are materially different from those of comparable companies or that cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on profitability  capital expenditures  cash flows or competitive position 
there is no assurance that changes in or additions to laws  regulations or rules regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact 
the company believes it is materially in compliance with environmental laws  regulations and rules 
in conjunction with the leasing of property to coal operators  all environmental and reclamation liabilities are the responsibility of the lessees 
however  if the lessee is not financially capable of fulfilling those obligations  there is a possibility the appropriate authorities would attempt to assign those liabilities to the landowner 
the company would vigorously contest such an assignment
