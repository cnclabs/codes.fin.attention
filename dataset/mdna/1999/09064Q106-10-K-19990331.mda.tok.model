item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto presented elsewhere herein 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  without limitation  those discussed in exhibit  in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under the caption business in this annual report on form k 
overview the company was founded in to develop certain resorbable polymers for orthopaedic uses 
the company has incurred substantial operating losses since its inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
such losses have resulted principally from expenses associated with the development and patenting of the company s self reinforcing technologies and resorbable implant designs  preclinical and clinical studies  preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory agencies  the development of sales  marketing and distribution channels  the write off of acquired in process research and development  and the development of the company s manufacturing capabilities 
although the company s revenues grew significantly in the second half of and during and and although the company reported a profit for and  no assurance can be given that revenues will continue to grow or that revenues of any magnitude will exceed expenses incurred in anticipation of future growth 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully commercialize its products or that profitability will continue 
the company first introduced its pga pins in and its pga screws in in  the company introduced its first plla products  plla pins 
plla screws were introduced in since the introduction of these products  the company has expanded its pga and plla pin and screw product lines to address additional clinical indications 
the company s pga membrane product was introduced in  and  in  the company launched its meniscus arrow  plla tacks  and pga and plla urology stents 
in  the company launched its cranio facial product line 
prior to  the company derived substantially all of its revenue from sales of its plla and pga screws and pins 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues and revenue growth in the second half of and during and resulted from sales of the meniscus arrow  which received fda clearance in march to date  all products sold by the company have been launched first in international markets 
during  and  international product sales represented  and  respectively  of the company s total product sales 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company typically sells or consigns implant grade  stainless steel surgical instruments for use with each of its self reinforced  resorbable products 
the sale of these instruments result in margins which are typically lower than the margins applicable to the company s implant products 
however  since orthopaedic companies operating in the us have traditionally loaned rather than sold instruments to their customers  the company anticipates that in the future  it will be necessary for the company to provide an increasing proportion of its instrumentation in the us on a loan basis 
in most cases  instrumentation is provided on a consignment basis to customers that commit to a certain purchase level of implant products 
the instruments are loaned on the basis of a one year consignment policy 
similar practices are not common in international markets 
for financial statement purposes  revenues from the sale of instrumentation systems are included within product sales and costs associated with such systems are included within cost of goods sold 
in the case of consigned product  the company amortizes the cost of the instrumentation over a three to four year period as cost of goods sold 
the company s instrumentation systems are reusable 
accordingly  sales and loans of such systems are likely to be most pronounced in periods shortly after product launches and likely to be less prevalent as penetration of the market increases over the long term 
for information regarding the company s instrumentation practices  see business products instrumentation 
the company sells its products through managed networks of independent sales agents  direct sales representatives  distributors and dealers 
in the us  the company handles all invoicing functions directly and pays commissions to its sales agents or representatives 
outside the us  the company sells its products directly to distributors and dealers at discounts that vary by product and by market 
accordingly  the company s us sales result in higher gross margins than international sales 
the company anticipates that during the next few years  the relative percentage of its us product sales to total product sales is likely to continue to increase 
since the company pays commissions on sales made through its us agent network  an increased percentage of us sales in the future will likely result in an increase in the percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses to total sales 
this increase will be partially offset by the higher gross margins received on products sold in the us outside of the orthopaedic market  the company may seek to establish licensing or distribution agreements with strategic partners to develop certain products and to market and distribute products that the company elects not to distribute through its managed networks of independent sales agents  distributors and dealers 
the company has licensed its membrane patent for use in dental and two other applications in europe to ethicon gmbh  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
during  ethicon gmbh paid the company approximately  no licensing fees were received during or ethicon gmbh has agreed to pay royalties to the company upon the initiation of commercial sales of its membrane products  which were released for commercial sale in july  revenues from the company s sales of such products have not been material 
no assurance can be given that royalty payments from ethicon gmbh will be material in the future 
furthermore  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to enter into other license arrangements regarding other products on satisfactory terms 
the company has entered into agreements pursuant to which the company is obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of certain of the company s products  including the meniscus arrow 
to the extent that sales of the meniscus arrow products and other licensed products increase in future periods  the company s license obligations are expected to increase 
the company currently manufactures its implant products solely at its tampere  finland plant 
the company intends to use a portion of its capital resources to establish a manufacturing capability in the us the company plans to establish this capability either by equipping and operating a leased facility or contracting with a third party to provide a manufacturing capability to the company 
the company believes that on an interim basis  contract manufacturing may enable the company to save certain staffing costs and enable senior management to focus on other aspects of its business 
however  if the company arranges for a third party to provide contract manufacturing in the us  fees payable to such manufacturer may exceed any savings in staffing costs and result in higher costs of goods sold and lower gross profit 
ultimately  in operating a us facility  the company will incur certain duplicative manufacturing costs which could result in higher costs of goods sold and lower gross profit margins 
for information regarding the operations of the company by geographic area  see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company invoices more than of its consolidated revenues in us dollars 
approximately of the expenses incurred by the company are denominated in us dollars 
the remaining portion of revenues and expenses are denominated in european currencies  predominantly finnish markka 
the company seeks to manage its foreign currency risk for these other currencies through the purchase of foreign currency options and forward contracts 
no assurances can be given that such hedging techniques will protect the company from exposure resulting from relative changes in the economic strength of the foreign currencies applicable to the company 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period 
while the company s operating losses have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for income tax reporting purposes as of december   the extent to which such carryforwards are available to offset future us and finnish taxable income is significantly limited as a result of various ownership changes that have occurred in recent years 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  the company may not be able to take full advantage of the us portion of these carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
furthermore  income earned by a foreign subsidiary may not be offset against operating losses of us entities 
the statutory tax rates applicable to the company and its foreign subsidiaries vary substantially 
tax rates have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations have fluctuated in the past on an annual and quarterly basis and may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future  depending on many factors  many of which are outside of the company s control 
such factors include the timing of government approvals  the medical community s acceptance of the company s products  the success of competitive products  the ability of the company to enter into strategic alliances with corporate partners  expenses associated with patent matters  the results of regulatory inspections and the timing of expenses related to product launches 
results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales 
the company s product sales increased by from million in to million in  and by to million in the increase in product sales in reflected further penetration in meniscus arrow sales in the united states from its us introduction in the second quarter of  as well as increased utilization of the company s managed network of independent sales agents in the us and increased sales of several non arrow products in both the us and international markets 
the increase in product sales in reflected continued penetration in meniscus arrow sales in the united states and increased sales of several non arrow products in both the us and international markets 
revenues generated from the sale of instrumentation systems and related loaner fees represented  and of total sales in  and  respectively  amounting to approximately million in  million in and million in the increase from the level to the level was attributable primarily to the us introduction of the meniscus arrow during the second quarter of the decline from to in both percentage and dollar terms declined due to the increasingly competitive environment 
instrumentation revenues relating to the meniscus arrow during  and were approximately   and  respectively 
license and grant revenues 
license and grant revenues decreased by from  in to  in and increased by to  in the decline in revenue from to was due to the lack of any license revenue recorded in  compared with  recorded in the increase in revenues from to resulted from an increase in the level of research activity during gross profit  gross profit margins 
the company s gross profit increased by from million in to million in and by to million in the increase in the company s gross profit during and primarily reflected the increased sales of meniscus arrow products after their introduction in the us in the second quarter of overall  the company s gross profit margin increased from in to in and increased to in during and  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the volume increase in revenues which created operational efficiencies in production 
the company s gross profit margin applicable to implant sales  representing implant sales less related raw materials  direct labor and overhead and associated variable expenses  increased from in to in and in the improvement in this portion of the company s gross profit margin resulted primarily from increased sales of higher margin meniscus arrow products  increased us based sales  increased sales of higher margin plla products and the leveraging of certain fixed manufacturing costs over the company s expanded revenue base 
the company amortizes the cost of instrumentation inventory consigned to customers  and classifies this as an inventory reserve 
this amortization charge increased from during to  during and  during the increase is due to a related increase in the number of instruments consigned to customers versus the previous practice of selling the instruments 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in  and by to million in such expenses were of product sales in  of product sales in  and of product sales in the increases in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses during these periods were primarily attributable to the costs incurred in the launch of the craniofacial division  the increase in commission payment obligations  reflecting the company s increased product sales in the us  the increase in expenses in regulatory and patent activities  including the costs of prosecuting patent infringement suits  and the increase in expenses associated with establishing and supporting a managed network of independent sales agents in the us selling  general and administrative expenses have declined as a percentage of revenue due to increased efficiencies resulting from the leveraging of certain non selling expenses over an expanded revenue base 
acquired in process research and development 
in september  in connection with the company s reorganization  the company recorded a non recurring charge of million for the acquisition of in process research and development 
this amount was expensed as non recurring charges because the acquired in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
since the reorganization  the company has used the acquired in process technology to develop new orthopaedic and craniofacial surgery products  which have or will become part of the company s line of products when completed 
the fair value of the in process technology in reorganization was based on analysis of the markets  projected cash flows and risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows 
in developing these cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual revenues  characteristics of the potential market for the products and the anticipated life of the underlying technology 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by from  in to  in and by to  in these increases reflected an increased volume of product development work being performed by the company and increased staffing levels 
other income and expense 
other income and expense consists of interest income and expense and miscellaneous expense and income items 
the company generated net interest expense of  during  and net interest income of  during and  during net interest income generated during and was obtained from funds received from the company s initial public offering during the second quarter of a foreign currency transaction gain of  was recorded in other income in  compared to a foreign currency transaction losses of  during net foreign currency transaction gains and losses in were insignificant

year compliance readiness the company s centralized corporate business and technical information systems have been fully assessed as to year compliance and functionality 
presently  these systems are nearly complete with respect to required software changes  tests and migration to the production environment 
the company anticipates that internal business and technical information system year compliance issues will be substantially remedied by the end of the second quarter this expectation constitutes a forward looking statement 
the company has satisfactorily completed the identification and review of computer hardware and software suppliers and is in the process of verifying  reviewing and logging year preparedness of general business partners  suppliers  vendors  and or service providers that the company has identified as critical 
costs the company incurred costs of approximately  in associated with the purchase of and modifications to the company s existing systems to make them year ready 
the company expects to incur costs between  and  in for a total project cost of less than  most of these costs relate to the implementation of a new internal business system  which will be depreciated over its estimated life 
any other cost relating to this undertaking will be expensed as incurred 
based on the estimates and information currently available  the company does not anticipate that the cost associated with year compliance issues will be material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risks and contingency plans considering the substantial progress made to date  the company does not anticipate delays in finalizing internal year remediation within the remaining time schedules 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company s internal systems or those of a third party on which the company relies will be year compliant by the year an interruption of the company s ability to conduct its business due to a year readiness problem could have a material adverse effect on the company 
anticipated completion of this review is estimated to be by the end of the second quarter of pending the results of the company s review of the year preparedness of its critical third parties  the company will then determine what course of action and contingencies will need to be made  if any 
quarterly product sales the following table presents unaudited product sales information for the quarters indicated 
in the opinion of management  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the product sales data included in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
product sales for any period are not necessarily indicative of product sales to be expected for any future period 
in thousands quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  quarter ended march  quarter ended june  quarter ended september  quarter ended december  the quarterly increases in product sales principally reflect the continuing development of the company s managed network of independent sales agents in the us and the us introduction of the meniscus arrow products during the second quarter of the company anticipates that in future periods  third quarter revenues may be adversely impacted due to relatively lower european sales activity during the summer months 
see results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales 
revenue trends will depend upon many factors  including demand and market acceptance for the company s existing and future products  the timing of regulatory approvals  the timing and results of clinical trials  the timing of the introduction of new products by the company and by competing companies  competitive sales practices  the ability of the company to enter into strategic alliances with corporate partners and the company s ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and marketing personnel 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that future revenues will not vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has relied upon bank loans guaranteed in certain instances by the company s principal stockholders  capital contributions by its principal stockholders and government grants to fund its operations 
in september  the company completed a private placement of million in preferred stock all of which was converted into common stock upon consummation of the company s initial public offering in april and warrants all of which were exercised during april 
the net proceeds were used to repay bank debt  to pay down trade debt  to fund manufacturing and product development efforts and for other working capital purposes 
during  the company consummated its initial public offering 
net proceeds from the initial public offering and the exercise of warrants during april were million 
in addition  the company made arrangements for a million credit line  secured by the personal property of bionx implants  inc and its biostent  inc subsidiary 
amounts to be advanced thereunder are subject to the lender s discretion and are limited to specific percentages of certain domestic receivables and inventory 
to date  no amounts have been borrowed pursuant to this facility 
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million resulted from the use of cash in operating activities  primarily attributable to increased inventory levels  and a million increase in plant and equipment 
as of december   the company had working capital of million  compared with million at december  long term debt including the current portion was reduced by  from the level at the beginning of the year to  as of december  the interest rates on the debt remaining as of december  averaged per annum 
the company believes that existing capital resources from its initial public offering  its september private placement and its million credit line  together with cash flow from operations if  and to the extent  generated  will be sufficient to fund its operations during this statement constitutes a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations regarding its capital requirements and its sources of capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available capital resources will depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of its existing and future products  the successful commercialization of products in development  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  acquisition opportunities  progress with preclinical studies  clinical trials and product clearances by the fda and other agencies  the cost and timing of the company s efforts to expand its manufacturing capabilities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development of strategic alliances for the marketing of certain of the company s products 
the sufficiency of the company s capital reserves with respect to operations beyond will depend primarily upon the company s operating results and the extent to which such results are capable of funding anticipated growth 
to the extent that funds generated from the company s operations  together with its existing capital resources  and the net interest earned thereon  are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
the terms of any equity financings may be dilutive to stockholders and the terms of any debt financings may contain restrictive covenants which limit the company s ability to pursue certain courses of action 
principal stockholders of the company who previously provided funding to the company and provided guarantees to sources of credit have indicated that they do not intend to continue furnishing such assistance 
the company does not have any committed sources of additional financing beyond that described above  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
