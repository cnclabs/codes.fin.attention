new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income 
sfas established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
comprehensive income generally includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distribution to owners 
the adoption of sfas had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
also in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas established standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim financial reports to shareholders 
the company adopted sfas in the first quarter of year issue the year issue refers generally to the data structure and processing problem that may prevent systems from properly processing date sensitive information when the year changes to the year issue affects information technology it systems  such as computer programs and various types of electronic equipment that process date information by using only two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year  and thus may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the issue also affects some non it systems  such as devices which rely on a microcontroller to process date information 
the year issue could disrupt a company s operations by generating erroneous data or causing system failures or miscalculations 
the company is involved in an extensive  ongoing program to identify and correct problems arising from the year issue 
the program is broken down into the following categories application systems  hardware  monitoring equipment  and computer applications of its significant suppliers and significant payors 
the company has evaluated the application systems in two parts as applications and client server applications 
the as applications are believed to be capable of functioning properly beyond the year at this time 
although the company originally had intended to replace its client server applications in  because that project will not be complete by year end  the company intends to remediate the existing client server application systems in the second quarter of  a process that the company estimates will take four months to complete 
remediation and testing of the as hardware is complete  and the remediation and testing of the company s individual personal computers is approximately complete 
the company expects the remainder of remediation and testing to be complete by april in the first quarter of  the company completed its review of embedded computer chips and software applications  which control certain monitoring and other equipment 
remediation efforts are expected to be minor and should be completed in the second quarter of in  the company spent approximately  for software and consulting fees associated with its initial year evaluation 
budgeted expenditures in total  the company is primarily addressing all year issues with current staffing levels 
in the first quarter of  the company sent inquiries to its significant suppliers and payors concerning the year compliance of their significant computer applications 
the company plans to send second requests during the second quarter of the responses received to date do not disclose any significant issues of non compliance 
the company will continue to evaluate year risks with respect to such suppliers and payors as responses are received 
in that connection  it should be noted that substantially all of the company s and prior revenues were derived from reimbursement by third party payors  and that the company is dependent upon such payors evaluation of their year compliance status to assess such risks 
if such payors are incorrect in their evaluation of their own year compliance status  this could result in delays or errors in reimbursement to the company  the effects of which could be material to the company 
in light of its compliance efforts and based on the information currently available  the company believes that its risk associated with problems arising from year issues is not significant 
however  because of the many uncertainties associated with year compliance issues  and because the company s assessment is necessarily based on information from third party payors and suppliers  there can be no assurance that the company s assessment is correct or that the year issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
the company will continue with its assessment process as described above and  to the extent that changes in such assessment require it  will attempt to develop alternatives or modifications to its compliance plan described above 
there can  however  be no assurance that such compliance plan  as it may be changed  augmented or modified from time to time  will be successful 
the sec s recent guidance for year disclosure calls for companies to describe their most likely worst case year scenarios 
notwithstanding the aforementioned issues  the company does not expect significant problems at the turn of the century with internal conversions and remediation 
however  the most likely worst case scenario is that if third party payors are not able to reimburse the company after the turn of the century  the company would be required to sustain operations through existing cash balances or through the use of available borrowings under its credit facilities 
also  the company would be required to add additional staff during the time period leading up to and immediately following january   in order to address any unexpected year issues

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate long term debt obligations 
at december   the company s total variable rate long term debt obligations  including the current portion of those obligations  was million 
a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to the december  outstanding balance of variable rate long term debt obligations would not have a material impact on the company s earnings or cash flows over a one year period 
with the acquisition of gainor medical and resultant increase in variable rate long term debt obligations  the company s interest rate risk will increase in future periods 
in the years and prior  the company s business was confined to the united states and  therefore  the company did not have any exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
with the acquisition of gainor medical  a significant portion of the company s future revenues may be designated in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company may face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of its global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
as a result  the company s future earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
