item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview revenues for lsi logic increased to billion in from billion in the increase is primarily attributable to revenues generated as a result of our purchase of symbios  inc symbios from hyundai electronics america hea on august  we recorded a loss from operations of million for compared to income from operations of million in the loss from operations in is primarily a result of a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of  a million charge for acquired in process research and development and an additional million of goodwill amortization stemming from the acquisition of symbios 
the charges stemming from restructuring actions  the in process research and development and goodwill amortization are discussed further below and in notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements referred to hereafter as notes 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million or loss per diluted share compared to net income for the same period in of million or income per diluted share 
while management believes that the discussion and analysis in this report is adequate for a fair presentation of the information  we recommend that you read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the remainder of this annual report on form k 
in and  our fiscal year ended december fiscal years and were week years  and fiscal year was a week year 
in  the fiscal year ended on the sunday closest to december for presentation purposes  the consolidated financial statements and notes refer to december as year end for all those years 
statements in this discussion and analysis include forward looking information statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
our actual results in future periods may be significantly different from any future performance suggested in this report 
risks and uncertainties that may affect our results may include  among others fluctuations in the timing and volumes of customer demand  currency exchange rates  availability and utilization of our manufacturing capacity  timing and success of new product introductions  and unexpected obsolescence of existing products 
the extent to which our plans for future cost reductions are realized also may impact our future financial performance 
we operate in an industry sector where security values are highly volatile and may be influenced by economic and other factors beyond our control

results of operations revenue 
in  we adopted statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we concluded that we operate in two reportable segments the semiconductor segment and the storage systems segment 
in the semiconductor segment  we design  develop  manufacture and market integrated circuits  including application specific integrated circuits asics  application specific standard products assps and related products and services 
semiconductor design and service revenues include engineering design services  licensing of lsi logic s advanced design tools software  and technology transfer and support services 
our customers use these services in the design of increasingly advanced integrated circuits characterized by higher levels of functionality and performance 
the proportion of revenues from asic design and related services compared to semiconductor product sales varies among customers depending upon their specific requirements 
in the storage systems segment  we design  manufacture  market and support high performance data storage management and storage systems solutions  including host adapter boards hab and a complete line of redundant array of independent disks raid storage systems  subsystems and related software 
the following table describes revenues from the semiconductor and storage systems segments as a percentage of total consolidated revenues reportable segments semiconductor storage systems the storage systems segment was added in with the purchase of symbios see note of the notes  and therefore financial data are not available for comparative purposes in prior years 
in addition  the segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment as defined in sfas no 
 and accordingly  separate financial information related to the segment has been excluded for the fiscal year total revenues increased to billion in from billion in this increase is primarily a result of additional revenues from symbios after august   and increased demand for our component products used in communications and networking applications 
the increase was offset in part by decreased demand for our component products used in computer product applications and lower average selling prices when expressed in dollars for component products used in computer and consumer product applications 
design and service revenues remained relatively consistent as compared to at of total semiconductor segment revenues 
in  all revenues were from the semiconductor segment 
during  one customer represented of our consolidated revenues 
total revenues increased to billion in from billion in the increase in revenues during primarily reflected an increase in demand for our component products used in consumer and communication applications 
the increase was offset in part by declines in demand for our component products used in computer applications and by lower average selling prices during as compared to when expressed in dollars 
design and service revenues remained relatively consistent as compared to at of total revenues 
one customer represented in and in of the company s consolidated revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
key elements of the consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenues  were as follows gross profit margin research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense loss income from operations gross margin 
gross margin percentage for decreased to from in the decrease reflects a combination of the following elements non recurring inventory charges  changes in product mix related to symbios product additions from august lower average selling prices  including the impact from currency fluctuations  and increased cost of sales from commencing operations at our new fabrication facility in gresham  oregon in december of the gross margin percentage for increased to of revenues  compared with in the increase was primarily related to increased manufacturing yields largely attributable to the installation of chemical mechanical polishing equipment during the fourth quarter of and to an improvement in capacity utilization during as compared to the increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices 
our operating environment  combined with the resources required to operate in the semiconductor industry  requires that we manage a variety of factors 
these factors include  among other things product mix  factory capacity and utilization  manufacturing yields  availability of certain raw materials  terms negotiated with third party subcontractors  and foreign currency fluctuations 
these and other factors could have a significant effect on our gross margin in future periods 
changes in the relative strength of the yen may have a greater impact on gross margin than other foreign exchange fluctuations due to our large wafer fabrication operations in japan 
although the yen weakened the average yen exchange rate for decreased from  the effect on gross margin and net income was not significant because yen denominated sales offset a substantial portion of yen denominated costs during those periods 
moreover  we hedged a portion of our remaining yen exposure 
see note of the notes 
future changes in the relative strength of the yen or mix of foreign denominated revenues and costs could have a significant effect on gross margins or operating results 
research and development 
total research and development r d increased or million to million during as compared to the increase is attributable to the following research and development expenditures for symbios included in our consolidated financial statements since august   expenditures related to the continued development of advanced sub micron products and process technologies  and upgrade from inch to inch wafer fabrication capability at our santa clara  california research and development facility 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses were in  in  and in total r d expenses increased from previous years r d spending by million to million in and by million to million in the increase in as compared to was primarily attributed to increased compensation and staffing levels and expansions of our product development centers as we continued to develop higher technology sub micron products and the related manufacturing  packaging and design processes 
as we continue our commitment to technological leadership in our markets and realize the benefit of cost savings from our restructuring programs in the third quarter of  we are targeting our research and development investment in the second half of to be approximately to of revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million during as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to sg a expenses from symbios since august  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue were in and and in sg a expenses increased million in and million in from previous years sg a spending 
the increases during and are primarily attributable to increased information technology costs related to upgrading our business systems and infrastructure 
we are targeting sg a expenses to decline in to of revenues as the benefit of cost savings are realized during from the restructuring programs established in the third quarter of in process research and development 
we reduced our estimate of the amount allocated to in process research and development ipr d by million from the million amount previously reported in the third quarter of to million for the year ended december  amortization of intangibles increased by million from million to million for the year ended december  the basic loss per share and loss per share assuming dilution decreased from to for the year ending december  we allocated amounts to ipr d and intangible assets in the third quarter of in a manner consistent with widely recognized appraisal practices and in consultation with our independent accountants pricewaterhousecoopers llp at the date of acquisition of symbios 
subsequent to the acquisition  the sec staff expressed views that took issue with certain appraisal practices generally employed in determining the fair value of the ipr d that was the basis for our measurement of our ipr d charge 
the charge of million  as first we reported  was based upon the work of an independent valuation firm that had utilized the methodologies the sec has since announced it does not consider appropriate 
as a result of computing ipr d using the sec preferred methodology  we  in consultation with our independent accountants  decided to revise the amount originally allocated to ipr d 
we have revised earnings for and will amend our report on form q and report on form k a previously filed with the sec 
the revised quarterly results for the third and fourth quarters of are included in this report under part ii
