the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiary is based on the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 
a and b liquidity and capital resources twelve months ended november  the company s main source of funds was additional bank borrowings 
the main use of funds by operating activities were increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the accounts receivable increase results from a slower payment pattern for our own branded equipment which increased the days outstanding from days to days 
inventory increased due primarily to case tillage equipment production scheduled for december expenditures for capital equipment were  including  to upgrade computer hardware and software 
the balance of the expenditures was spent on production equipment 
six months ended november  for the six months ended november   the company s main source of funds resulted from net income plus depreciation 
this source was offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in customer deposits 
the inventory increase resulted from a higher production load at november  due primarily from case tillage equipment 
customer deposits were from down payments on beet equipment 
this equipment was shipped during the six month period  consequently the decrease in customer deposits 
comparison of year ended may  with may  in fiscal year  the company used  of cash from operations compared to generating  cash from operations in fiscal year the decrease in cash from operations in fiscal year reflects an increase in inventories and receivables  offset in part by increased net income and payables 
in fiscal year  major capital expenditures included two acquisitions 
the first acquisition was a line of potato farming equipment and associated service parts 
the second acquisition was a line of grain wagons and associated service parts 
the acquisitions  which included fixed assets and inventory  were financed by the issuance of  shares of art s way common stock  loans from the state of iowa and local sources obtained through the state of iowa community development block grant program and borrowings under the company s short term line of credit 
capital resources in april  the company amended its revolving line of credit agreement 
the agreement allows for borrowings up to  based upon a percentage of the company s accounts receivable and inventory and allows for letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of  at november  the company has borrowed  and has  in outstanding letters of credit 
the interest rate is based on the bank s referenced rate and is variable based upon certain performance objectives with a maximum of plus 
of the referenced rate and a minimum of plus zero at november  
the amendment also provides for a restructured long term loan in the principal amount of  the principal amount is repayable in monthly installments of  with the final payment due august unless the revolving credit facility is renewed 
in the event that the term of the revolving line of credit is subsequently extended  the term loan shall continue to amortize  based upon the payment schedule outlined above 
all loans  advances and other obligations  liabilities and indebtedness of the company are secured by all present and future assets 
the company s current ratio its working capital are as shown in the following table november  november  may  may  current assets     current liabilities     working capital     current ratio the company believes its liquidity  capital resources  and borrowing capacity are adequate for its current and intended operations 
c results of operations twelve months ended november  compared to the twelve months ended november  the following proforma unaudited information is presented for the twelve months ending november  in order to facilitate the analysis for the twelve months ending november  unaudited november  net sales  gross profit  operating expenses  interest expense  net income  revenue increased to  from  while the company recorded a net loss of  
per share compared to a net income of  
per share in the prior year 
the loss was all in the fourth quarter  where revenues were higher at  from  the increase in sales revenue was due to our new contract to provide tillage equipment and related service parts to case corporation 
total sales arising from the contract were  the company also benefited from a new agreement with new holland to supply a forage blower similar to that provided to other oem customers 
this major increase in oem business more than offset a decline in demand for the company s branded products 
a collapse in potato prices  low hog prices and a poor farm economy in the red river valley region  all contributed to the decline in demand 
gross profit decreased from for the twelve months ended november  to for the twelve months ended november  this dramatic change of percentage points results primarily from a change in product mix from oem  art s way brands in to oem  art s way brands in oem business inherently is less profitable 
this product mix impact reduced our gross margin by percentage points 
problems incurred in the start up of the new tillage products due to late vendor delivery of components and absorbing new manufacturing processes resulted in scheduling problems for all products 
this resulted in significant overtime to catch up  with a consequent deterioration in production efficiency 
warranty costs increased  due to startup problems with a new model beet harvester 
operating expenses were up from last year 
the full year impact of the restoration of the company contribution to the employee k plan impacted expenses by  group insurance to cover employee medical costs rose  new product introduction costs were   was spent on outside consultants to determine the cause of our deteriorating manufacturing performance 
bad debt reserves were increased by  to cover the adverse potato market conditions 
overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales dropped from in to in higher inventory levels throughout the year caused an increase in interest expense by 
other financing expenses include  charge in the fourth quarter to be in compliance with fasb on the accounting treatment for sales of accounts receivable 
six months ended november  sales increased due mainly to strength in sugar beet harvesting equipment and related service parts 
other strong areas included corn stalk shredders  where the company enjoyed its best season since  the supramix vertical feed mixer and our traditional grinder mixer products 
two areas of weakness in sales were the termination of our oem contract to make frames for a local fiberglass body manufacturer and our deliberate scaling back of logan potato equipment production in view of a dramatic downturn in potato prices and customer demand 
gross profits increased due to improved production efficiencies  a product mix of higher margin products and improved purchasing of raw materials 
warranty expenses were impacted adversely by  due to unanticipated problems with our new model beet harvester 
the company encountered learning curve expenses associated with the new tillage production for case 
operating expenses are up as the company added staff in engineering and sales to support our new product lines and to enhance our position in the beet and feed processing business and due to the reinstatement of the company s contribution to the employee k retirement plan 
interest costs were up  as the higher sales volumes required higher working capital requirements 
comparison of year ended may  with may  sales revenues for fy rose due to the acquisitions described above and returning strength in other areas of our existing business 
sales from the acquisitions exceeded  the feed processing business was up  and sales gains were made in our land maintenance line 
sales declined in the sugar beet equipment line as we deliberately delayed production beyond may  to minimize working capital  make manufacturing room for our new products  and to allow more time for the development of new features 
gross profit for fy rose on the higher sales volume  however fiscal year gross profit was impacted by a  inventory write down 
the ratio of cost of goods sold to net sales improved to from last year s prior to the write down 
this improvement in fy resulted from lower raw material costs and reduced warranty expense 
operating expenses were higher than fy the two acquisitions accounted for most of the increase  which included amortization of purchase costs and additional employees to support the acquisitions 
in addition  the company strengthened our beet equipment resources in the engineering area 
the wage reduction implemented in june was progressively restored which further increased operating expenses 
the ratio of expenses to sales fell from in fy to in fy interest expense was lower in fy when compared to fy improved manufacturing flow reduced working capital requirements throughout the year 
utilization of deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and considering the expiration dates of tax credits and carryforwards  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at november  see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
year issues in the company began preparing its computer based systems for year yk computer software compliance issues 
historically  certain computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  software may recognize a date using the two digits as rather than the year computer programs that do not recognize the proper date could generate erroneous data or cause systems to fail 
the company s yk project covers its significant computer programs and certain equipment  which contain microprocessors and is divided into five major phases assessment  planning  conversion  implementation and testing 
the company has completed the assessment and planning phases and is currently in the conversion  implementation and testing phases 
systems which have been determined not to be yk compliant are being either replaced or reprogrammed  and thereafter tested for yk compliance 
the company expects the conversion  implementation and testing phases to be complete by mid the company s yk project also considers the readiness of significant customers and vendors 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting critical suppliers and customers regarding their plans and progress in addressing their yk issues 
the company has received varying information from such parties on the state of compliance or expected compliance 
the non compliance of such vendors could impair the ability of the company to obtain necessary products or to sell or provide services to its customers 
disruptions of the computer systems of the company s vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations for the period of such disruption 
contingency plans are being developed in the event that any critical supplier or customer is not compliant 
the company has incurred approximately  of yk project expense to date 
future expenses are estimated to be approximately  such cost estimates are based upon presently available information and may change as the company continues with its yk project 
the company believes that its internal operating systems will be year compliant before december  therefore  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario will be that one or more of third parties with which the company has a material business relationship will not have successfully dealt with its year issues 
a critical third party failure such as telecommunication  utilities or financial institutions could have a material adverse affect on the company by eliminating the company s ability to order and pay for products from suppliers and receive orders and payments from customers 
it is also possible that one or more of the internal operating systems will not function properly and make it difficult to complete routine tasks  such as accounting and other record keeping duties 
based on information currently available  the company does not believe there will be any long term operating systems failures 
however  the company will continue to monitor these issues as part of its year project and will concentrate its efforts on minimizing their impact
