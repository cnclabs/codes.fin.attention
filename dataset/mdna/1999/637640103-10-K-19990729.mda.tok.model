item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto results of operations the company recorded net sales of billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal lower sales in fiscal were caused by significant price reductions in the cyrix m ii line of products due to increased competition and availability of new  higher speed microprocessor products from competitors  combined with the lack of successful new product introductions from the company s network products division 
lower sales were also heavily driven by a general slowdown in new orders the company experienced  particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 
economic uncertainties in japan and the asia pacific region that prevailed during the first half of calendar partially contributed to the slowdown in new orders 
the decline in sales for fiscal from sales for fiscal was primarily due to the absence of sales for the fairchild semiconductor group fairchild  which the company divested in late fiscal the company incurred a loss of billion in fiscal compared to a loss of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal of the total loss in fiscal  million was attributable to special charges for restructuring of operations 
the remaining loss was primarily driven by lower sales and margin erosion mainly due to lower factory utilization and price reductions  particularly in the cyrix microprocessor products 
the restructuring charges in fiscal included million related to the company s decision in may to exit the personal computer pc microprocessor business and million related to its announcement in november to consolidate the wafer manufacturing operations in greenock  scotland see restructuring of operations 
these amounts were partially offset by an million release of excess reserves related to certain prior restructure actions that were completed during the year 
the timing of these actions was consistent with the timetable previously announced 
in addition to the restructure charges  the fiscal operating results included million in charges related to the exit of the pc microprocessor business 
the charge included million against sales for product returns  million included in cost of sales for the write down of cyrix microprocessor inventory and million included in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for accounts receivable allowances 
a million charge for costs associated with the termination of a wafer manufacturing and marketing agreement between cyrix and ibm see note was also included in cost of sales for fiscal the decline in operating results in fiscal from results in fiscal was primarily attributable to the absence of fairchild sales combined with special items of million 
the special items included a net million charge for restructuring of operations related to a worldwide workforce reduction announced in april  million for cyrix merger costs and million for in process r d charges related to the acquisitions of comcore semiconductor  inc million  future integrated systems  inc million and the digital audio technology business of gulbransen  inc million 
sales price erosion that affected average selling prices in most of the company s product areas was the primary cause for the overall decline in sales for fiscal sales in fiscal for analog products declined by percent from fiscal sales 
general weakness experienced by the company in the pc and communications products related markets contributed to the decline in sales for the company s analog products  particularly sales in the first half of the year 
industry wide excess capacity forced average analog selling prices to decline over the year  which more than offset increased unit shipments 
despite the overall decline in sales for analog products  sales within analog for application specific wireless communications products grew by percent over fiscal sales 
this growth was driven by higher unit volume with some modest price declines 
sales for network products in fiscal declined percent from fiscal sales  as the company continued to experience declining shipments in its existing mature portfolio of ethernet products 
the company s failure to introduce successful new network products since the second half of fiscal was the primary cause of the sharp drop in fiscal sales for network products 
cyrix microprocessor sales also declined by percent from fiscal sales 
significant price reductions in the cyrix m ii products caused the decline in cyrix sales  despite a unit volume increase 
highly competitive pricing trends and higher speed microprocessor offerings by competitors negatively impacted average selling prices of cyrix microprocessors 
sales of integrated microprocessors and certain other pc related peripheral products declined percent in fiscal from fiscal as a result of a decrease in both units and prices 
although integrated microprocessors are now targeted at a variety of information appliance applications  historically  the vast majority of sales of integrated microprocessors through the end of fiscal have been achieved through pc products  such as sub  desktop pcs and lower cost notebook pcs 
the decline in sales for information appliance products was also driven by the general weakness in the pc and communications products related markets experienced during the year 
fiscal sales decreased in all geographic regions compared to sales in fiscal the decreases were percent for the americas  percent for japan  percent for europe and percent for the asia pacific region 
while the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales had an unfavorable effect on sales in japan as the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen  it was offset by a generally favorable effect experienced in europe 
as a result  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation had minimal effect on the overall decrease in sales 
for fiscal  sales as a percentage of total sales increased to percent for the asia pacific region and declined to percent for the americas  while it remained constant at percent for europe and percent for japan 
although sales in fiscal decreased overall by percent from sales in fiscal  fiscal sales were percent higher than fiscal sales of billion without fairchild 
this increase occurred despite lower sales in the second half of the year that were caused by the slowdown in new orders affected by economic uncertainties in the asia pacific region and difficulties the company encountered in ramping up adequate volumes of the cyrix media gx microprocessor product to the speed levels the market demanded 
the growth in sales was led by sales for cyrix microprocessors and sales for analog products  which grew over fiscal sales by percent and percent  respectively 
contributing to this growth in sales  sales within analog for application specific wireless communication products grew percent over fiscal sales 
sales for information appliance products including integrated microprocessors and certain other pc related peripheral products grew by percent over fiscal sales 
however  sales for network products declined by percent from fiscal sales 
this decline was caused by a sharp drop in sales in the second half of the year due to the company s failure to introduce key new network products combined with decreased unit shipments and price erosion in its mature ethernet product line 
overall  sales increases were the result of increased unit shipments despite some price declines 
sales for fiscal for the asia pacific region and europe increased by percent and percent  respectively  while sales for the americas and japan decreased percent and percent  respectively 
in addition to the effect from the general economic slowdown in japan  the dollar value of foreign currency denominated sales had an unfavorable impact in both japan and europe as the dollar strengthened against the japanese yen and most major european currencies 
fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to approximately one fourth of the overall decline in sales 
in fiscal  sales in the asia pacific region and europe increased to percent and percent of total sales  respectively  while sales for the americas and japan declined to percent and percent of total sales 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal excluding the effect of charges related to the ibm contract termination of million and the write down of cyrix microprocessor inventory of million related to the exit of the pc microprocessor business  gross margin for fiscal was percent 
the primary factors contributing to the decline in gross margin continued to be lower factory utilization combined with price erosion  particularly in the cyrix microprocessor products 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal was percent compared to percent for fiscal this was primarily a result of running the company s manufacturing facilities except those located in maine at reduced capacity utilization rates during most of the year in order to manage inventory levels and control costs 
capacity utilization in maine reached percent in the third quarter of fiscal  as the ibm action enabled the company to ramp up its own microprocessor manufacturing and more fully utilize the capacity available in its micron wafer fabrication facility 
however  capacity utilization in maine was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  falling to percent at the end of the fiscal year  as a result of the decision to exit the pc microprocessor business 
during the year the company incurred expenses of approximately million associated with consolidating the greenock capacity and transferring related processes  which ultimately contributed to the decline in gross margin 
until the company completes the closure of its inch wafer fabrication facility in greenock and moves this volume and related processes to its other manufacturing facilities  gross margin will be unfavorably affected by additional costs associated with this effort 
in fiscal  gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to percent from percent in fiscal gross margin percentage without fairchild declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the primary factor contributing to the decline was reduced factory utilization 
although wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal was percent  compared to percent in fiscal  wafer fabrication capacity utilization declined to percent in the last month of fiscal due to the slowdown in new orders experienced in the second half of the year 
economic uncertainties in the asia pacific region and unstable conditions in the pc market affected the slowdown 
significant margin erosion in cyrix products combined with significant ramp up costs associated with the new wafer fabrication facility in maine also contributed to the decline in gross margin 
research and development research and development r d expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
fiscal and comparative amounts exclude million and million  respectively  for in process r d charges related to acquisitions  which have been separately presented as special items in the consolidated statement of operations 
r d expenses for fiscal excluding fairchild were million 
while the company was able to manage r d expenses in fiscal to more closely align spending with current business conditions  a significant portion of these expenses were directed towards developing cyrix microprocessor based products and developing advanced sub micron processes in manufacturing high performance pc microprocessors 
as described in note  the company announced  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  its decision to exit the pc microprocessor business and its intention to sell a majority interest in its wafer fabrication facility in south portland  maine 
the company continued to invest resources in the development of new microprocessor cores and in the integration of those cores with the company s other technological capabilities in order to develop system on a chip products aimed at the emerging information appliance market 
the company also continues to invest resources in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the personal systems  communications and consumer markets  as well as in the process technologies needed to support those products 
for fiscal  the company devoted approximately percent of its r d effort towards the development of process technology and percent towards new product development 
this represents a decrease of percent and percent in spending for process technology and product development  respectively 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent 
the decrease in fiscal reflects the effect of certain actions taken by the company in late fiscal to reduce its overall cost structure in response to weakened business conditions 
the decrease in fiscal is attributable to the absence of expenses for fairchild and reflects the effect of centralization initiatives implemented in connection with the company s fiscal reorganization 
restructuring of operations during the past three fiscal years  the company has undertaken a number of restructuring actions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more complete information related to these actions 
charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with the company s acquisitions during fiscal of comcore semiconductor  inc comcore  future integrated systems  inc 
fis and the digital audio technology business of gulbransen  inc  approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the total purchase price was allocated to the value of in process r d 
these amounts were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative uses exist 
comcore was a designer of integrated circuits for computer networking and broadband communications that used powerful mathematical techniques combined with advanced digital signal processing dsp and customized design methodologies to create high performance communications integrated circuits 
this technology was acquired in order to add advanced design and technology capabilities to the company s existing analog  mixed signal and digital expertise 
fis supplied graphics hardware and software product for the personal computer market 
the company acquired the fis design expertise to enhance its ability to integrate advanced graphics capabilities into system on a chip solutions for the personal computer market 
the gulbransen audio compressor technology was acquired to provide digital audio building blocks for system on a chip solutions 
in each acquisition  the fair value of the in process r d was based on discounted projected net cash flows expected to be derived after successful completion of the r d projects underway 
estimates of future cash flows from revenues were based primarily on market growth assumptions  lives of underlying technologies and the company s expected share of market 
gross profit projections were based on the company s experience with products that were similar in nature or products sold into markets with similar characteristics 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and capital charges were deducted from gross profit to determine net operating income for the in process r d projects 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue and included sales and market expenses and development costs to maintain the technology once it has achieved technological feasibility 
the company discounted the net cash flows of the in process r d projects using a discount rate that approximates the overall rate of return for each acquisition as a whole and reflects the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process r d project 
interest income and interest expense net interest expense was million for fiscal compared to net interest income of for fiscal and million for fiscal net interest expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to less interest earned due to slightly lower rates on lower average cash balances while interest expense was relatively consistent  as average debt balances remained unchanged 
net interest income was higher in fiscal than in fiscal primarily due to the combination of increased interest earned on higher average cash balances partially offset by less interest expense from lower average debt balances 
in addition  the company capitalized million of interest associated with capital expansion projects in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income expense  net other income  net was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal for fiscal  other income  net included million of net intellectual property income primarily related to a significant licensing agreement with a korean firm and a million gain on the sale of technology 
this was offset by a million settlement of disputes involving intellectual property rights and a million net loss on equity investments 
this compares to other income  net for fiscal  which included million of net intellectual property income related to a significant licensing agreement with another korean firm  as well as smaller ongoing royalty receipts and a million gain from investments primarily arising from the sale of stock from the company s investment holdings 
other income  net for fiscal included million of net intellectual property income  a million net gain related to the company s equity investments  a million gain from the sale of a digital answering machine integrated circuit business and a million receipt from the settlement of litigation 
none of the license agreements in fiscal were considered individually material 
income tax provision benefit the company recorded an income tax benefit in fiscal and of million and million  respectively  resulting in an effective tax rate benefit of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
for fiscal  the company recorded income tax expense of million for an effective tax rate of approximately percent 
the tax rate benefit in fiscal is less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets for the benefit of us tax losses that may not be realized offset by a benefit recorded as a result of the resolution during the year of certain outstanding tax assessments 
realization of recognized net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on the company s ability to generate future us taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted us taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these tax assets 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet these expectations 
foreign operations the company s foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities are denominated in local currency  which exposes the company to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s risk exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities is concentrated in pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions are hedged  where practical  using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
the company s risk exposure from foreign revenue is limited to the japanese yen and major european currencies  primarily german deutsche marks  french francs and italian lira 
the company hedges up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is  at times  hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
financial market risks the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of the company s investment portfolio 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of the company s debt obligations 
a decrease in interest rates would favorably benefit the company  but would not necessarily result in a material decrease in interest expense  since the amount of the company s variable rate debt is not significant 
a substantial majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen and certain other asian and european currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  the company has established revenue and balance sheet hedging programs 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
adverse change defined as percent in certain asian currencies and percent in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s balances as of may  financial condition as of may   cash and short term investments decreased to a total of million from a total of million at may  cash generated from operating activities was million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating cash was negatively affected by the losses incurred in fiscal  but was positively impacted by the company s effort to manage working capital 
the primary contributor to this effort was a significant reduction in inventories 
cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash utilization in fiscal was due to reduced capital expenditures and no business acquisitions 
lower capital spending in fiscal was driven by significantly reduced expenditures for the maine wafer fabrication facility  which was essentially completed by the end of  and management s effort to control the overall level of capital expenditures in response to weakened business conditions 
investing activities in fiscal included capital expenditures of million  which were offset by cash proceeds of million related to the disposition of fairchild 
the company s financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the proceeds of a million drawdown on new equipment loans and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
these amounts were partially offset by million of general debt repayment 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was from the proceeds of a million drawdown on new and existing equipment loans and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
these amounts were offset by the million redemption of substantially all of the cyrix convertible subordinated notes in january and million of other general debt repayment 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily from the proceeds of a million issuance of the cyrix convertible subordinated notes  million for the drawdown on a new equipment loan and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
these amounts were offset by general debt repayment of million 
management foresees substantial cash outlays for plant and equipment throughout fiscal however  the fiscal capital expenditure level is expected to be significantly lower than the fiscal level 
existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  are expected to be sufficient to finance planned fiscal capital investments 
recently issued financial accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company is presently analyzing this statement and has not yet determined its impact on the company s financial statements 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
for fiscal year outlook the statements contained in this outlook and within certain sections of management s discussion and analysis are forward looking based on current expectations and management s estimates 
actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and more integrated products 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
in addition  substantial capital and r d investment are required to support products and manufacturing processes 
as a result of these industry conditions  the company may experience periodic fluctuations in its operating results 
the company s strategy is to provide system on a chip solutions for its key data highway strategic partners  exploiting its analog expertise as a starting point for forward integration 
as a result of this focus  the company expects to grow at or above market rates of growth in particular segments of the analog  mixed signal and information appliance markets 
while business conditions for the semiconductor industry and the company remained weak throughout most of fiscal  the company experienced growth in new orders in the latter half of the fiscal year 
this growth was stimulated by an increase in orders for analog products 
in particular  new orders for application specific wireless communications products showed significant improvement as we saw strengthening in the cellular and wireless markets during the spring quarter 
this increase in order rates was also evidenced by the sequential quarterly improvement of sales in fiscal for analog products 
the company believes its business in these areas is strong and growing and anticipates this improvement to continue into fiscal however  the company faces the risk that the current improvement in the semiconductor industry may be of short duration 
unless the rate of new orders continues to increase  the company may be unable to attain the level of revenue growth expected for fiscal and operating results will be unfavorably affected 
the company anticipates the reduction in future sales caused by its exit from the pc microprocessor business will be offset by increased sales of its remaining products 
the company has also devoted efforts to develop new network products since the spring of fiscal in order to regain its market position 
the company anticipates the development of new products based on digital signal processing technology acquired from comcore to begin generating sales late in the first quarter of fiscal unforeseen obstacles or schedule delays  as well as customer acceptance of product  may affect the company s sales and results of operations 
the rate of orders and product pricing may also be affected by continued and increasing competition and by market growth rates in the personal computer  communication and networking areas 
while business conditions and overall market pricing have a major influence on gross margin  the company s decision to exit the pc microprocessor business  improvements in manufacturing efficiency and the introduction of new products are expected to result in future gross margin improvement 
future gross margin improvement is also predicated on increased new order rates of higher margin multimarket analog products 
future gross margin is also affected by wafer fabrication capacity utilization 
although management expects to more fully utilize wafer capacity  this expectation is predicated on a continuing improvement trend of new orders  as well as increasing sales volume 
failure to improve manufacturing capacity utilization will negatively impact the company s ability to achieve its desired gross margin improvements 
in connection with the decision to exit the pc microprocessor business  the company significantly reduced its planned level of wafer starts in its inch wafer manufacturing facility in maine and incurred an impairment loss of approximately million for that facility 
in the short term  the reduction in unutilized fixed costs of operating this facility mitigates the impact of lower capacity utilization 
however  if the company is unable to complete the sale of a majority interest in this facility  future gross margin may continue to be affected by lower capacity utilization 
the company also faces the risk that it may be unsuccessful in seeking a satisfactory buyer for the facility 
this may require the company to pursue other alternatives  such as offering the available capacity to other companies in the form of wafer foundry services 
retention of this manufacturing facility may have an unfavorable impact on future operating results 
recently  the company announced the impending sale of its pc microprocessor business to a taiwanese company 
while the company is currently negotiating the terms of this sale  it will continue to incur expenses associated with maintaining this operation in the interim 
the company faces the risk that this negotiation may ultimately be unsuccessful 
if it fails to reach an acceptable agreement  the company will be forced to complete the necessary actions to close its pc microprocessor business 
the company also faces the risk that it may encounter unexpected delays or problems in the execution of other actions announced in may  which were taken to position the company for future profitability 
the actions  which include its decision to close the inch development wafer fabrication facility in santa clara  are dependent on the successful and timely completion of planned closure activities 
failure to successfully complete these activities on a timely basis may have an unfavorable effect on the company s future operating results 
future gross margin will also be affected by the ultimate disposition of the wafer fabrication facility in greenock 
as previously discussed  the company announced plans to consolidate its wafer manufacturing operations in greenock  scotland  and to seek investors to acquire and operate the facility as an independent foundry business 
if the company encounters unexpected delays or other problems related to these planned actions  future operating results may be unfavorably affected 
the company may also be unsuccessful in seeking investors to acquire the operations under terms acceptable to the company 
retention of the manufacturing operations may have an unfavorable impact on the company s future operating results 
it is also difficult to predict the final impact of the planned spinout on the company s future operating results  since the structure and timing have not yet been determined 
a final price lower than originally estimated will have an unfavorable impact on the company s future operating results 
the company s focus is to continue to introduce new products  particularly more highly integrated system on a chip products and higher margin analog products 
if the development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future gross margin may also be unfavorably affected 
the company believes that continued focused investment in research and development  especially on the timely development and market acceptance of new products is a key factor to the company s successful growth and its ability to achieve strong financial performance 
national s product portfolio  particularly products in the personal systems and communications area  have short product life cycles and both successfully developing and introducing new products are critical to the company s ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
ongoing r d spending for fiscal is expected to be lower than for fiscal  primarily due to the company s planned closure of its development wafer fabrication facility in santa clara and the substantially reduced product development associated with pc microprocessors 
the company also expects overall sg a expenses to be lower for fiscal than for fiscal as the full benefit of the cost reduction actions implemented or announced in fiscal takes effect 
because of significant international sales  the company benefits overall from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
as such  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may unfavorably affect the company s consolidated sales and net income 
the company attempts to manage the short term exposures to foreign currency fluctuations  but there can be no assurance that the company s risk management activities will fully offset the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
in connection with the fairchild transaction  fairchild and the company have entered into a manufacturing agreement under which the company is obligated to purchase goods and services from fairchild through june prior to march  these goods and services had been provided by fairchild at cost 
under the agreement  the company has committed to purchase manufacturing services based on specified terms 
the agreement also requires the company to purchase a minimum of million in goods and services based on declining annual minimum levels over the term of the agreement 
future minimum purchases remaining under the agreement are million for fiscal the company is committed to these minimum levels whether or not the minimum levels are required based on future demand 
to the extent that the minimum levels exceed future demand  the company s gross margin and operating results will be unfavorably affected 
the company also has a continuing obligation to indemnify fairchild in the event of certain environmental and legal matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate satisfaction of these obligations will not have a material adverse impact on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
from time to time  the company has received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries within which the company operates 
there can be no assurance that these governments or other government entities will not serve future notices of assessments on the company  or that the amounts of such assessments and the failure of the company to favorably resolve such assessments would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company is engaged in tax litigation with the internal revenue service and its tax returns for certain years are under examination in the us there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of the tax proceedings or tax examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
year readiness program the company began year readiness projects as early as  but significantly accelerated its efforts in early to identify and correct potential problems prior to encountering year dates 
the company launched its comprehensive year project in january to identify and correct potential problems associated with year dates in all of its systems and operations worldwide 
the objectives of this project are to achieve zero impact on customers  eliminate product and delivery problems and attain zero impact on the company s financial performance 
although a complete zero defect solution is probably unattainable  management expects only minor problems that can be dealt with rapidly 
the company set strict parameters for locations worldwide to adhere to quarterly reviews of all projects  notify customers of known problems as early as possible and address the readiness of suppliers as well as internal operations 
these readiness projects required employees to share knowledge  raise awareness  and identify and correct the potential year impact on manufacturing  shipment and delivery  as well as the financial impact of potential loss of business or recovery costs  and potential problems with the company s products in the field 
a program management process was put in place as follows year exposure was identified and broken into individual projects with leaders assigned  projects were planned and are managed by assigned leaders who provide quarterly status updates to a year review committee the year review committee is a committee comprising members from business  information technology  manufacturing  internal audit and external consultants  all projects have target completion dates with sufficient leeway to apply closer management if necessary  and overall status is reported quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors and executive management 
after thorough reviews  projects were initiated in the following specific areas business systems  manufacturing systems  engineering systems  desktop computing  information technology infrastructure  facilities  suppliers products and readiness  and company products 
a common approach was used to inventory equipment and systems including operating systems  application software and embedded firmware  require that all future purchase orders and contracts with vendors include a year compliance clause  obtain letters from suppliers requesting year compliance status and upgrade costs  test all systems whether a supplier claims compliance or not  perform upgrades or replacements as dictated by suppliers  and test upgrades and replacements 
below are summaries of the project areas mentioned above business systems all systems supported by the company s corporate information services group and all programs used in production have been inventoried as part of the year readiness project using the company s year inventory methodology 
inventoried programs are reviewed systematically using a software tool that identifies references to dates in any format 
that process then identifies for review any code that potentially requires changes 
the company also used a tool to simulate the computer system date to any value before or after the year the company has used this tool to test the rollover date from december  to january   as well as many dates before and after those days 
many of the company s corporate business systems were deemed ready for the year as early as january  when year dates began to appear in system data 
critical business systems remediation was completed in april the company has already moved to its fiscal accounting calendar commencing on may  without incident 
the company expects to have adequate time during the balance of calendar to complete remediation of noncritical systems 
manufacturing systems manufacturing systems are being addressed through a coordinated project involving the company s manufacturing sites 
the project interacts with the company s corporate information services group to maximize leverage of activity across sites and with corporate efforts 
the project is approximately percent complete with the remaining remediation efforts scheduled to be completed by august common approaches include formats for project plans  inventory and status spreadsheets  test validation forms and scorecards that are reviewed by senior management 
all manufacturing sites have been using year compliant shop floor control systems since april and significant progress has been made in the remediation and testing of manufacturing equipment 
all test results for manufacturing equipment have been documented on standardized forms to ensure thoroughness 
engineering systems the project to address computer aided design hardware and software for year readiness addresses the standard software products used by the company and the operating environments in which they run 
all key suppliers have provided assurance that their software is year ready 
internal testing of software from key suppliers has been completed and no year problems were found 
critical computing platform and local area network inventory  testing and remediation was completed in may desktop computing the desktop project addresses the year readiness of all desktops in the company through research  diagnostic tools  communication programs and the broad implementation of centralized server applications 
at the heart of the desktop program is a database that communicates minimum bios levels for major hardware suppliers and the release levels for standard and popular shrink wrap software 
in addition to this information approach  diagnostic software is available to aid in desktop discoveries and upgrades 
the database is in place today and is being augmented through continuing supplier research and program benchmarking with other companies 
completion of desktop evaluation and compliance will extend well into in may  the company completed testing of every desktop system to ensure year compliance 
the deployment of the centralized server strategy is also a key element in desktop readiness  since moving to centralized servers immediately enables noncompliant desktop systems to work without problems 
information technology infrastructure the company s infrastructure group project ensures that all critical information system infrastructure elements worldwide will either be year ready or eliminated from the network before the year this project includes networks  mainframe operations and servers 
most network devices and servers are year ready today 
a major project to upgrade the company s mainframe computing environment was completed in december actions addressing critical voice and video components were upgraded in april infrastructure strategies of centralization  standardization and simplification reduced the company s year effort considerably as nonstandard hardware  software  protocols and applications were removed from the network and computing environments 
facilities the scope of the facilities project includes operations at the company s worldwide manufacturing sites  business centers  sales offices and design centers 
it encompasses facilities management systems for example  temperature  humidity  pressurization and cleanliness of clean rooms  hazardous gas networks for example  leak monitoring and auto shutdown of hazardous gases  ultrapure water and wastewater treatment  automatic gas cabinets  door access  fire protection  uninterrupted power systems  utility services  chillers  boilers  bulk gas plants  lighting  elevators and variable speed drives for fan and pump motors 
the facilities project was substantially complete in may suppliers products and readiness the company s purchasing group established a year program to ensure that products purchased operate correctly without year issues and that year issues will not cause an interruption of service from the company s suppliers 
the company has incorporated product compliance certification as standard in its conditions of purchase since september key suppliers are required to take the necessary steps to ensure their own readiness and report to the company on the status of their year programs 
the company has contacted more than  suppliers about year readiness 
more than suppliers were designated key suppliers and have been requested to certify their readiness 
all of the designated key suppliers have responded to our inquiries with percent reporting as ready 
in may  the company evaluated plans and assigned a risk factor to the readiness projects of suppliers who provide materials and services critical to operations 
these risk assessments are being used for contingency planning 
company products the company considers its products to be year compliant if the product  when used in accordance with associated documentation provided by the company  is capable of correctly storing  displaying  processing  providing and or receiving date data from  into  and between the years and and beyond including leap year calculations  provided that all other products used with the company s product  such as hardware  software and firmware  properly exchange accurate date data with it 
company products that do not process date related information are considered to be year compliant 
the company has made year compliance information for products available to customers on the company s web site 
the company s products fall into the following categories for year compliance products that have no date functions and therefore have no year compliance issues products that are year compliant  with possible customer software firmware issues 
although the company s products that are certified year compliant are capable of accurately processing date related information into the next century  it is the customers responsibility to ensure that all other parts of their system or product are also capable of an error free transition into the year for instance  customer firmware embedded onto microcontrollers or additional software developed may independently create errors in date processing 
semiconductors are only one of many building blocks in a product or system  and all components working together must be capable of properly processing date data after in order to be year ready real time clock products sold by the company do not have century counters 
their year registers count from to and then start over again  which is documented in the applicable product datasheets 
accordingly  the software in each system that the customer chooses to use in conjunction with the company s real time clock products needs to be validated by the customer to ensure year compliance custom products made by the company for customers are based on customers design specifications 
the company generally has no knowledge of the functions and or features of those parts 
when the company manufactures custom parts  it is incumbent on the customer to determine if those parts are year compliant obsolete products were not included in the company s review of products for year compliance products announced as obsolete or discontinued by the company prior to september 
questions regarding year readiness on obsolete products are addressed upon request 
the company continues to evaluate its exposure to contingencies related to the year for products it has sold even though the company believes that its products do not directly contain century counters that provide calendar year functions 
the company has not received notification from any of its customers that a company product performs noncompliant year functions 
however  customers may use the company s products in conjunction with customer supplied software  over which the company has no control  that may perform noncompliant year date computations 
the company s remediation efforts are substantially complete and the focus is now being directed toward contingency planning 
management is confident in the company s ability to transition to the year without incident but will establish contingency plans in the event of unforeseen critical failures 
the company reasonably believes that its most likely worst case year impact would relate to problems with systems of suppliers and customers rather than with the company s internal systems or products 
the company has less control over the year assessment and remediation efforts of third parties and believes the risks are greatest with infrastructure providers power  water and communication services  logistics elements transportation and customs and suppliers of materials and services  especially where the company is dependent on a limited number of potential suppliers for those materials and services 
in addition  remediation of remaining manufacturing equipment elements is dependent on the timely availability of hardware and or software solutions from vendors 
failures with the company s infrastructure providers and failures of vendors to successfully implement year modifications in manufacturing tools and related systems could result in the inability to manufacture and deliver products to customers 
contingency planning for supplier issues will include identifying and qualifying second sources for critical components  considering the need to increase the inventory levels of certain products above normal stocking levels and evaluating the need to deploy strategic inventory quantities geographically 
such efforts should be completed by august since customers use the company s products in conjunction with customer supplied software over which the company has no control  there is also a risk of litigation associated with the use of such products by customers 
such risk includes all the uncertainties and costs associated with litigation 
because of the unprecedented nature of the year issue  it is impossible for the company to predict the nature and extent of such litigation  although it could be significant to the company 
regarding the company s internal systems  some of the critical contingency plans are extensions of existing business continuity programs and have been in place since the start of the year readiness program 
the company s business continuity program was successfully tested in may the year project costs and resource consumption are estimated at million  of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
approximately percent of costs are related to internal staff costs with the remaining percent for hardware and software upgrade costs that are incremental to ongoing operating expenses 
testing will continue through the remainder of and the beginning of to ensure the continued compliance of all elements of the company s year program 
the company reviews and updates cost data on a quarterly basis 
these cost assessments are based on management estimates that were determined based on future events  a portion of which are outside the company s direct control 
as the company continues its year readiness project  these cost estimates may change 
management does not believe that changes in cost estimates will have a material impact on future results of operations 
the forward looking statements discussed or incorporated by reference in this outlook section involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the general economy  regulatory and international economic conditions  the changing environment ofthe semiconductor industry  competitive products and pricing  growth in the pc and communications industries  the effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  and such other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports and filings
