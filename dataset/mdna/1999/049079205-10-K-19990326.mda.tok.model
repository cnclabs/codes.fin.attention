item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s revenues and income from operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiary  gt t 
gt t derives almost all of its revenues from international telephone services 
in june  the company acquired a interest in digicom sa  a haitian corporation principally engaged in dispatch radio  mobile telecommunications and paging  for million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
in july  the company acquired a interest  with certain options to increase that interest to  in bermuda digital communications  ltd  a bermuda corporation which  when operational  will be the sole cellular and pcs competitor in bermuda to the bermuda telephone company for million in cash 
the company also provided a loan to bermuda digital communications  ltd 
of million at citibank prime which was at december  plus 
the company has signed advisory fee contracts with both digicom sa and bermuda ditigal communications ltd 
compensating it at of gross revenues for management services provided  effective from the respective acquisition dates 
the assets  liabilities  and operations of digicom sa and bermuda digital communications  ltd  individually and in the aggregate  are not currently material to the assets  liabilities  and operations of the company on a consolidated basis 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations expenses  international long distance expenses and taxes other than income taxes 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audiotext providers from whom gt t derives international audiotext traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of parent company overheads and amortization 
for accounting purposes  the december split up transaction of the company into two separate publicly held companies the company and the emerging communications  inc has been treated as a non pro rata split off of a business in which the split off entity is to be accounted for at fair value 
the company has been considered to be the split off entity since emerging communications  inc had a greater market capitalization and greater asset value immediately after the transaction  retained more of the pre transaction top management of the company and had greater net income in accordingly  the balance sheet of the company at december  has been adjusted to fair value as evidenced by the market capitalization of the company immediately after the consummation of the transaction 
this adjustment includes an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated net fixed assets  and an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated stockholder s equity 
the fair value adjustment reduced the carrying value on the company s consolidated financial statements of its fixed assets significantly below their historical cost and replacement value 
therefore  depreciation expense for periods after december  is not a reliable indicator of the company s cost of replenishing its assets 
the combined financial statements included in this report are the separate financial statements relating to atlantic tele network  inc s business and operations in guyana including its majority owned subsidiary  gt t  and atn s activities as the parent company of all of its subsidiaries during the years ended december  and these combined financial statements do not reflect the fair valuation adjustment arising from the split up transaction 
moreover  the combined statements of operations include interest income from indebtedness of subsidiaries which were transferred with such indebtedness to emerging communications  inc in the split up transaction and certain expenses for the period from may  to december  which were reimbursed by emerging communications  inc as part of the split up transaction 
as a result of the decline in in gt t revenues and profits from audiotext traffic  on december  gt t filed an application with the puc for a significant increase in rates for local and outbound international long distance service so as to enable gt t to earn a return on its rate base 
effective february   gt t was awarded an interim increase in rates 
subsequently on march   the puc reduced its interim rate increase effective in part on april  and in part on may  the reduced rates represented a substantial increase over the rates in effect during and earlier years 
on october   to reflect changed conditions since december   gt t filed for an additional rate increase designed to generate million in additional revenues over and above the interim rates currently in effect 
gt t s two applications for a permanent rate increase are still pending before the puc 
no assurance can be given as to what permanent rates the puc will award gt t or as to what changes the puc may make in the current interim rates 
in january  after the chairman of the puc held a press conference which dealt extensively with the rate issues under consideration by the puc  gt t applied to the guyana high court for an order prohibiting the chairman from further participating in the rate case on the grounds that this press conference and his statements at the press conference revealed a predetermination and bias by the chairman against gt t on the pending issues 
in response to this application  the guyana high court issued an order directing the chairman and the puc to show cause why such an order of prohibition should not be issued 
the guyana high court s order has the legal effect of barring the chairman from further participation in the rate case pending a determination by the guyana high court of the merits of gt t s application and  thus  is likely to further delay a decision by the puc on gt t s pending applications 
results of operations years ended december  and telephone operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for net income for was million or per share per share on a fully diluted basis 
pro forma net income for was million or per share 
the pro forma results give effect to the december  split off transaction as if it had been completed at the beginning of operating results for include a fourth quarter net gain to atn of million arising from the devaluation during of the guyana dollar  million of revenues recognized in the third quarter as a result of a settlement with a foreign telecommunications carrier of a claim for the interruption of international long distance dial service to guyana during  and approximately million in other non operating income in the first quarter of as a result of the settlement of a claim arising from the cancellation of an insurance policy 
after excluding these unusual items  the company s core operating revenues and earnings for were million and million respectively or per share 
the company s revenues and pro forma net income for included the recognition of million of outbound international long distance revenues by gt t for the period from october to january as a result of a guyana high court decision in after excluding this unusual item  the company s core operating revenues and pro forma net income for were million and million or per share 
excluding the one time items in and discussed above  core revenues in decreased by million or 
this decrease was due primarily to the expected decline in audiotext revenues at gt t 
gt t s volume of audiotext traffic fluctuated between and million minutes per month in the first three quarters of in the fourth quarter of  the volume of audiotext traffic declined to approximately million minutes per month 
in the four quarters of  audiotext traffic further declined to an average of approximately million  million  million  and million minutes per month  respectively 
the company expects that audiotext traffic volumes will continue to decline  although the company is unable to predict future audiotext revenues and traffic volumes with any degree of certainty 
the decrease in audiotext revenues was partially offset by an increase in local exchange services  which increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase in local exchange service revenues was primarily the result of the temporary rates granted by the guyana public utilities commission puc in response to a rate increase application filed by gt t with the puc on december  the increase is also partially attributable to an increase in lines in service to  at december  from approximately  at december   an increase of  lines or 
international long distance inbound revenues other than audiotext increased to million as compared to million in this represents an increase in million or and correlates to an increase in inbound minutes of traffic from million in to million in  an increase of million minutes or 
the balance of the increase is due to changes in traffic mix and other factors 
management believes that this increase in inbound telephone traffic other than audiotext is indirectly the result of the increase in temporary rates for outbound long distance traffic granted by the puc in early because a substantial portion of gt t s international traffic  other than audiotext  consists of personal calls between guyanese expatriates and their friends and families in guyana  management believes that an increase in rates for outbound calls results not only in a decrease in the volume of outbound calls  but that decrease in outbound calls in turn stimulates an increase in the volume of inbound calls 
as is noted elsewhere in this report see business regulation  the fcc has adopted mandatory international settlement rate benchmarks for payments by us telecommunications carriers to telecommunications carriers in other countries including guyana  and at t has taken steps  including giving a notice of termination effective december  of the existing operating agreement between at t and gt t to force gt t to agree to a lower settlement rate for us guyana traffic 
any significant reduction in the settlement rate for this traffic could have a significant adverse impact on gt t s earnings since inbound traffic from the united states to guyana significantly exceeds outbound traffic and since any significant reduction in the settlement rate for this traffic also might make it difficult for gt t to continue to attract audiotext traffic from the united states on a profitable basis 
any of these events would provide gt t with a basis to seek an increase in rates for local and outbound international service so as to permit gt t to earn its contractually provided rate of return 
however  there can be no assurance as to when or whether gt t would receive such a rate increase 
excluding the one time accrual of million of revenue in discussed above  international long distance outbound revenues decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease in core international long distance outbound revenues is primarily related to the increased rates awarded by the puc  as the volume of outbound international long distance traffic declined approximately in after eliminating a million gain from devaluation of the guyana dollar which after guyana tax expense arising from the devaluation and minority interest results in the net gain to the company of million previously mentioned  core telephone operating expenses were million in compared to million in this represents a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due principally to a decrease in audiotext and outbound traffic expense at gt t of million due to decreased traffic volumes 
core telephone operating expenses were approximately of core telephone operating revenues in as compared to approximately of core telephone operating revenues in excluding from core operating revenues in each year and from core operating expenses in the effects of the one time items discussed above 
the decrease in core operating expense as a percentage of core operating revenues from to is due primarily to the decline in audiotext revenues  the decline in outbound traffic and associated international long distance expenses  and the increases in local revenues as a result of the temporary rate increase awarded by the puc 
other operations  revenues and expenses represent the operations of digicom sa and are not material 
the company acquired a interest in digicom on june  income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest for was million as compared to million for this represents an increase of million or and is principally a result of the factors affecting revenues and operating expenses discussed above 
as has been noted above  in the first three months of  the company recorded approximately million in other non operating income as a result of the settlement of a claim arising from the cancellation of an insurance policy 
this settlement was intended to compensate the company for the increased cost of replacement insurance coverage over the remaining term of the cancelled insurance policy  which was approximately ten years 
the increased cost of the company s replacement insurance coverage will be accounted for as an expense over the remaining term and should not be material to the company s results of operations in any period 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the minority interest in earnings consists primarily of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
years ended december  and operating revenues for were million as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was principally due to a million  or  decrease in audiotext traffic revenues at gt t 
gt t s volume of audiotext traffic fluctuated between and million minutes per month in in  the volume of audiotext traffic declined during the year to approximately million minutes per month in the fourth quarter 
the reduction in traffic volume is estimated to account for approximately million  or of the million decrease in audiotext revenues in chargebacks from a carrier for the year ended december  approximated million  representing of the decline in revenues from audiotext traffic 
the remaining million  or of the decrease in audiotext revenues  resulted from a combination of the following the mislabeling of the origin of certain traffic  changes in the traffic mix  certain accounting rate reductions  and the strength of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies 
mislabeling of the origin of traffic occurs when a carrier reports traffic as coming from one country when it actually originated in another 
changes in traffic mix refers to the mix between countries of origins which have different accounting rates  and accounting rate reductions occur when the company and a foreign administration telephone company agree to a change in rates 
as a result of the above factors  gt t s profit margins from this traffic also declined in given the company s recent experience  the company expects the negative trend in audiotext revenues to continue which could have a material adverse impact on the company s total revenues  although the company is unable to predict the magnitude of the decline in future revenues with any degree of certainty 
gt t s outbound international revenues for were million  an increase of million over the prior year even though traffic volumes were approximately lower in than in the increase in revenues was principally a result of the recognition of million in revenues relating to outbound international long distance revenues at gt t for the period from october to january the balance of the increase is attributable to the restoration in january of the higher rates that were in effect in october operating expenses for were million  a decrease of million or  from operating expenses of million for the prior year 
the decrease was due principally to a decrease in audiotext and outbound traffic expense at gt t of million  due to decreased traffic volumes 
somewhat offsetting the decrease was an increase in plant specific and plant non specific expenses which increased as a result of increased plant in service 
income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest for was million  a decrease of million or  from income from operations before interest expense  income taxes and minority interest of million for the prior year 
this decrease is principally a result of the factors affecting revenues and operating expenses discussed above  even though gt t recognized approximately million of revenues relating to outbound international long distance revenues for the period october to january discussed above 
net interest expense decreased  due to reduced debt resulting in income before income taxes and minority interest for of million  a decrease of million or  compared to million for the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate for was as compared to for the corresponding period of the prior year 
the minority interest in earnings consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
regulatory and tax issues the company is involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see notes and to the company s combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes its existing liquidity and capital resources will be adequate to meet current operating and capital needs 
without external financing  the company expended a total of illion in cash to acquire a interest in digicom saand a interst in bermuda digital communications  ltd 
during additionally the company provided a million loan to bdc 
during  gt t repaid to the company all inter company loans 
the company s current primary source of funds is advisory fees from gt t 
if and when the tax and regulatory issues discussed in notes and to the combined and consolidated financial statement included in this report are resolved  the company anticipates that gt t may begin paying dividends to its stockholders  the company and the government of guyana 
these tax and regulatory issues could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
gt t is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
if and when the company settles outstanding tax and regulatory issues with the guyana government and the puc  gt t may require additional external financing to enable gt t to further expand its telecommunications facilities 
the company has not estimated the cost to comply with the october puc order to increase the number of telephone lines in service  but believes such a project would require significant capital expenditures that would require external financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
the company believes that the majority of gt t s revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars or other hard currencies 
however  as a result of the rate increases recently awarded to and currently sought by gt t and the efforts of the us fcc  at t and carriers in other countries to reduce international accounting rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of the company s revenues will be earned in guyana currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on the conversion of guyana currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyana currency or foreign currency from guyana  there is little liquidity in the foreign currency markets in guyana 
during and in recent months gt t has had some difficulty in converting significant amounts of guyana currency into us dollars 
while the company believes that it has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in hard currency to meet its current operating  debt service and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into hard currency to meet such obligations 
at december   approximately million of the company s total cash balances consisted of balances denominated in guyana dollars 
the company is currently exploring several opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean and elsewhere 
the company believes it has adequate capital resources to acquire these properties and licenses without any external financing 
however  there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms the company will be able to acquire any of the businesses or licenses it is currently seeking 
impact of devaluation and inflation although the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars or other hard currencies  the results of operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in  the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through subsequent to december   the guyana dollar has declined in value to approximately to the us dollar at december  the effect of devaluation and inflation on the company s financial results has not been significant in the periods presented  except that  as is previously discussed in the comparison of and operating results  the company recognized a net gain of million in as a result of the devaluation of the guyana dollar during forward looking statements and analysts reports this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including statements concerning future rates  revenues  costs  capital expenditures  and financing needs and availability and statements of management s expectations and beliefs 
actual results could differ materially from these statements as a result of many factors  including future economic and political conditions in guyana  and the matters discussed in notes and to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report
