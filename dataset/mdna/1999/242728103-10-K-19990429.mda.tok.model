one of these locations was purchased in may for approximately  it is not the company s intention to purchase store locations  however  when the location and economics are suitable  such transactions will be evaluated 
the company believes that internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital expenditures  none of which are material  and current operating needs 
year readiness disclosure the year issue exists because many software programs  computer hardware  operating systems and microprocessor based embedded controls in automated equipment use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as the year  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process financial and operational information incorrectly or fail to operate 
the operation of the company s business is dependent  in part  on its computer software programs and operating systems collectively  programs and systems 
the programs and systems are used in several key areas of the company s business  including merchandising  inventory management  pricing  sales  distribution  financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the company has been evaluating its programs and systems to identify potential year compliance issues 
these actions are necessary to ensure that the programs and systems will recognize dates and process information in the year and beyond 
it is anticipated that remediation of some of the company s programs and systems and replacement of some of the company s programs and systems will be necessary to make such programs and systems year compliant 
as part of its evaluation  the company reviewed both information technology it and non it systems 
the company has concluded that non it systems are not significant to the ongoing operation of its business 
although the company is not currently aware of material year compliance issues relating to systems of other companies with which the company does business  there is no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by such issues affecting the systems of such other companies 
as of january  the status of the company s progress toward becoming year compliant was as follows estimated estimated approximate amount estimated completion system complete total cost expended to date date quarter ending financial   april  pc mainframe including operating systems   july  merchandising distribution warehousing   july  these projects will be funded from internally generated funds 
the company believes that it will be able to achieve year compliance through the remediation of some programs and systems and through the replacement of other programs and systems 
however  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful  or that the company will not be materially adversely affected by any failures of these remediation and replacement projects 
management of the company believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of its year plan 
because of the range of possible issues and the large number of variables involved  it is impossible to quantify the potential cost of problems should the company or its trading partners not properly complete their year plans or become year compliant 
such costs and any failure of compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that the most likely risks of serious year business disruption are from outside parties  such as utility companies  financial institutions  telecommunications and transportation services 
in the event the company does not properly complete its year efforts or is affected by the disruption of outside services  the company could be unable to conduct its business 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has not developed contingency plans 
development of such plans will be considered if the company believes that its replacement and remediation efforts may not be completed on a timely basis or it determines that the inability of third parties to complete their year resolution process will materially affect the company
