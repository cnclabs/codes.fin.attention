 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a material impact on the company 
year the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations 
the company has been replacing its software and hardware as part of its long term technological plans 
the new software being implemented functions properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
all software used in the accounting system is in the process of being replaced 
the key software components used in the accounting system are the general ledger and traffic system 
the general ledger is used to record all transactional activity whereas the traffic system is used to record the airing of commercials  perform billing and maintain the accounts receivable detail 
the new general ledger software has been implemented in twelve of the thirteen locations in which the company operates 
the one remaining location will implement the new general ledger software by may  ten of the twelve radio station markets in which the company operates have implemented the new traffic software 
the two remaining radio station markets will implement the new traffic software at or around june the company is in the process of reviewing the hardware used in its operations that might be affected by the year problem 
hardware testing for year compliance is anticipated to be completed by june  inquiries of the company s top ten customers  vendors and service providers regarding year compliance will be made during the company decided  after the merger with tichenor media system  inc in february  to change its general ledger and traffic system software so all locations would be on the same system 
the replacement of the general ledger and traffic system software was not accelerated due to year issues 
the company does not believe the costs related to the year compliance project will be material to its financial position or results of operations 
unanticipated failures by critical customers  vendors and service providers  as well as the failure by the company to execute its own remediation efforts  could have a material adverse effect on the cost of the year project  its completion date  and the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has not yet established contingency plans in the event of the failure of its system with regard to year compliance or those of its significant customers  vendors and service providers 
based on its assessment of the year issue  the company will establish contingency plans  however there is no assurance that such plans will be adequate to meet the company s needs in the event of any disruption in the company s operations
