results of operations the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  were negatively impacted by the adverse market conditions prevalent in the steel and scrap metals sectors during the year 
these market conditions were characterized by a significant decline in the price and demand for scrap metals 
this decline resulted in large part from the increase in steel imports flowing into the united states  principally from japanese  brazilian  russian and southeast asian steel producers during the last six months of by way of example  for the twelve months ended december   steel imports into the united states increased by approximately compared with the same period of  according to the american iron steel institute 
the oversupply of domestic steel resulting from the high levels of steel imports resulted in a sharp curtailment of steel production during the second half of calendar and a corresponding decline in demand for scrap metals 
at the same time  the export market for scrap metals was severely disrupted as a result of the international financial crisis  principally experienced by the asian economies during this period 
the negative impact on the scrap metals industry of these adverse market conditions can be seen in the dramatic decline in the market price of scrap metals during the period 
the price of no 
heavy melting steel  the prime grade of scrap used to manufacture steel  for example  declined from per gross ton in january to approximately per gross ton in november  with the most precipitous decline coming after july  when the price of no 
heavy melting steel was per gross ton 
during this period of adverse market conditions  the company s sales were significantly lower than expected and the company was unable to implement its strategy of maximizing inventory turns  resulting in significant losses 
during this period  the company initiated a number of cost cutting measures  including a significant reduction in the company s work force  and accelerated the integration of its businesses in an effort to reduce annual operating expenses by at least million 
no assurance  however  can be made that these cost cutting objectives will be achieved or that the objective will be achieved without adversely affecting its operations 
in the fiscal quarter ended march   the company experienced improvements in its results of operations as a result of improved demand and pricing in the scrap metals industry 
the company s management believes that the improved demand and pricing fundamentals demonstrated in the fiscal fourth quarter represent the beginning of a return to more normalized market conditions in the scrap metals industry 
the company believes that as a result of the cost cutting initiatives that it has undertaken during the adverse market conditions prevalent in its fiscal year ended march   it is well positioned to benefit from improving market conditions 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  consolidated net sales for the years ended march  fiscal and march  fiscal in broad product categories were as follows in millions net net weight sales weight sales commodity weight in thousands ferrous metals tons   non ferrous metals lbs   brokerage ferrous tons  brokerage nonferrous lbs   other consolidated net sales for the year ended march  were million compared with consolidated net sales of million for the year ended march  since april   the company has acquired companies  including naporano and schiavone  which are primarily ferrous processors  and kimerling which is primarily a non ferrous processor 
the company s consolidated net sales increased by million or to million during fiscal  principally due to acquisitions consummated during the year 
consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended march   however  were significantly below the company s expectations  principally as a result of the effect of the adverse market conditions described above on the company 
the company s consolidated net sales in the quarter ended june   for example  were million compared with sales of million in the quarter ended december  and million in the quarter ended march  the decline in sales from quarter to quarter is notable because the company completed five acquisitions in the month of july ferrous sales of processed materials represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase in ferrous sales as a percentage of total sales is primarily due to the inclusion of the sales of naporano and schiavone from their respective dates of acquisition and a full year of sales of cozzi iron metal which was acquired by the company in december each of these subsidiaries derive their sales principally from ferrous metals 
non ferrous sales of processed materials represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the sale of non ferrous metals increased during the year ended march  over the prior year period as a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales of aerospace which was acquired in january  the sales of superior forge  which was acquired in march through the date of its disposition in march and the sales of kimerling from its date of acquisition in july the sales of each of these companies are predominately non ferrous 
brokerage ferrous sales represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  brokered ferrous sales increased in the year ended march  due to the inclusion of a full year of sales from the isaac group in fiscal as compared to only months of sales following the acquisition of the isaac group in fiscal brokerage non ferrous sales represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  other sales reflect  among other categories  stevedoring sales generated by naporano  which was acquired in fiscal consolidated gross profit was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with consolidated gross profit of million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the million increase in the dollar amount of the consolidated gross profit resulted principally from increased sales volumes in fiscal over the prior period as a result of the acquisitions completed during the year ended march  the decrease in consolidated gross profit margin for the year ended march  resulted primarily from adverse market conditions which resulted in lower than anticipated sales volumes and metal sales margins  principally in the second and third fiscal quarters 
during the year ended march   the company recorded approximately million of inventory write downs due primarily to lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
these write downs are included in cost of sales 
consolidated general and administrative expenses were million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase in general and administrative expenses over the prior year period is due to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of those operations acquired by the company since april the increase in consolidated general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales reflects the decrease in the company s consolidated net sales due to adverse market conditions 
depreciation and amortization expense was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase  both in dollar and as a percentage of consolidated net sales  is attributed to the inclusion of goodwill amortization and depreciation of fixed assets of those operations acquired by the company since april the increase as a percentage of consolidated net sales reflects the decrease in the company s consolidated net sales due to adverse market conditions 
during the year ended march   the company recorded non cash and non recurring expenses of million compared with million for the year ended march  the non cash and non recurring expenses of million consisted of the following in millions non cash warrant compensation expense income merger related costs loss on superior forge disposition facility abandonment and integration impairment of long lived assets severance  facility closure charges  and other see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this report 
interest expense was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase is primarily due to the issuance of the senior subordinated notes and additional borrowings made by the company under the senior credit facility during fiscal to fund acquisitions and operations 
net loss from continuing operations  after preferred stock dividends  was million per share for the year ended march  the net loss for fiscal resulted primarily from i the lower than anticipated sales volumes  lower realized scrap prices  and reduced metal margins experienced by the company during the year as a result of the adverse market conditions which were prevalent during the second and third quarters of fiscal  and ii from the recognition of million of non cash and non recurring expenses 
income tax benefit for the year ended march  was million  which yields an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes and the permanent differences represented by non deductible goodwill amortization and goodwill impairment write offs  other non deductible expenses  and the reversal of million of tax benefits previously established for warrant compensation expense resulting from the decline in the quoted market value of the company s common stock 
during the year ended march   the company recognized an extraordinary charge of million  net of taxes  related to the early retirement of debt and other costs principally incurred in connection with the closing of the senior credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this report 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  consolidated net sales for the years ended march  and march  fiscal in broad product categories were as follows in millions net net weight sales weight sales commodity weight in thousands ferrous metals tons  non ferrous metals lbs   brokerage ferrous tons brokerage non ferrous lbs   other consolidated net sales for the year ended march  were million compared with consolidated net sales of million for the year ended march  the significant increase in consolidated net sales was principally due to the inclusion of the net sales of the companies acquired by metal management during the year ended march  ferrous sales of processed materials represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the significant increase in ferrous sales  both in tons sold and as a percentage of consolidated net sales  was due primarily to the inclusion of ferrous sales of houtex  reserve iron metal  the isaac group  proler southwest and cozzi iron metal  each of which is primarily engaged in the sale of ferrous metals 
non ferrous sales of processed materials represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the decrease in percentage of non ferrous sales was due to the acquisitions of houtex  reserve iron metal  the isaac group  proler southwest and cozzi iron metal  which primarily sell ferrous metals 
the increase in pounds of non ferrous metals sold was due to the inclusion of non ferrous sales of the macleod companies and aerospace  which are primarily engaged in the sale of non ferrous metals 
brokerage ferrous sales represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the company did not have any brokerage ferrous sales for the year ended march  brokerage ferrous sales are mainly generated by reserve iron metal  the isaac group and cozzi iron metal  each of which was acquired during the year ended march  brokerage non ferrous sales represented of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase in pounds and dollars of brokerage non ferrous sales is due to the acquisitions of the isaac group and aerospace  each of which was acquired during the year ended march  consolidated gross profit was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with consolidated gross profit of million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the price of scrap metal is affected by regional and seasonal variations 
furthermore  prices for scrap metal are also impacted by broad and global cyclical movements and as such equilibrates supply and demand 
consolidated general and administrative expenses were million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects the inclusion of a full year of administrative expenses for those operations acquired during the year ended march  and the inclusion of a partial year of administrative expenses for the operations acquired by the company during the year ended march  corporate overhead also increased due to additions in corporate staff and corporate expenses ie legal  audit  travel  etc 
to support the acquisition strategy the company is pursuing 
the reduction in general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales reflects the large scale of operations at reserve iron metal  the isaac group and cozzi iron metal that provides for more efficient allocation of administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared with million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  the increase was attributed to the inclusion of goodwill amortization and depreciation of fixed assets of those operations acquired by the company since the year ended march  during the year ended march   the company recorded the following non cash and non recurring pre tax charges  totaling million of consolidated net sales in millions non cash warrant compensation expense facility abandonment  shut down  and integration impairment of long lived assets severance  facility closure charges  and other see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this report 
interest expense was million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  compared to million of consolidated net sales for the year ended march  this increase was due to the issuance of notes to sellers and the incurrence and or assumption of debt associated with the acquisitions completed since the year ended march  loss from continuing operations  after preferred stock dividends and accretion  was million per share for the year ended march  compared to a net loss of million per share for the year ended march  the increase in the loss was primarily attributable to the non cash and non recurring expenses recorded by the company in the year ended march  loss from continuing operations excluding the non cash and non recurring expenses and the one time non cash dividend charge was million per share for the year ended march  income from discontinued operations was million per share for the year ended march  compared to million per share for the year ended march  income during fiscal mainly reflects the royalty income recognized by the company from the sale of its discontinued operations  net of certain expenses paid 
results for fiscal reflect three months of operations of the discontinued businesses as well as the gain on sale of the discontinued operations 
income tax benefit for the year ended march  was million of consolidated net sales  which yields an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the permanent differences represented by non deductible goodwill amortization and certain non deductible  non cash and non recurring expenses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has required significant amounts of capital to fund its operations  capital expenditures and acquisition program 
the company has funded these cash needs principally through cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under the senior credit facility  and the issuance of equity securities  the senior subordinated notes  and most recently  the senior secured notes 
during fiscal  as a result of adverse market conditions and the impact of such adverse conditions on the company s liquidity  the company also sold certain non core assets  principally its superior forge west coast aluminum forging operations 
the company s management anticipates that the company will continue to have significant cash needs to fund its operations  capital expenditures and acquisition program 
while the company believes that its cash generated from operations and undrawn borrowing availability under the senior credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity to fund its operations  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  limitations in the documentation governing the senior credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and the senior secured notes will limit the company s ability to incur additional debt to fund significant acquisition or expansion opportunities unless and until the company s results of operations show significant improvement for four consecutive quarters 
the company continues to evaluate the prospects of raising capital through the issuance of equity and the sale of certain non core businesses 
however  because of the recent decline in the trading price of the company s common stock  the sale of equity on terms that are acceptable to the company will likely be difficult to achieve in the near term 
as a result  no assurance can be made that the company s efforts to sell equity will be successful 
in addition  the recent adverse market conditions experienced by most participants in the scrap metals industry has limited the number of potential purchasers for those operations that the company has considered selling  as well as the price that such potential buyers would be willing to pay for those operations 
accordingly  the company faces significant challenges in effecting asset sales or equity issuances on terms acceptable to it under present market conditions 
cash flows from continuing operations the company generated million of cash from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended march  the company generated cash flows from continuing operations primarily from the collection of accounts receivable 
cash flows from investing activities during the fiscal year ended march   the company used million for investment activities  net of million generated from the sale of superior forge 
of this amount  million was used to fund acquisitions completed by the company during the year and related acquisition costs 
in addition  during the year ended march   the company used million to fund the purchase of property and equipment and million to buy out certain operating leases 
during fiscal  the company also advanced million to southern recycling pursuant to a three year promissory note bearing interest at per annum 
cash flows from financing activities during the fiscal year ended march   the company generated million from financing activities  net of the repayment of certain indebtedness 
during this period  the company entered into the senior credit facility and used borrowings thereunder to refinance substantially all of the secured indebtedness of the company 
the company also issued million of senior subordinated notes  the net proceeds to the company of which were million 
fees incurred by the company in fiscal in connection with debt issuances amounted to million 
subsequent financial transaction on may   the company issued million principal amount of senior secured notes due on june  the senior secured notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of interest on the senior secured notes is payable semi annually 
the senior secured notes were issued at of their principal amount and are redeemable by the company  in whole or in part  at of their principal amount at any time after june  a second priority lien on substantially all of the company s property  plant and equipment has been pledged as collateral against the senior secured notes 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million  after the original issue discount and transaction fees and expenses  which were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility 
this transaction significantly increased the company s undrawn availability under the senior credit facility  thereby increasing the company s liquidity and financial flexibility 
financial condition cash requirements for maturing debt obligations and interest payments on november   the company is required to make a semi annual interest payment of million on the senior subordinated notes 
the company s amended senior credit facility allows the company to make interest payments on the senior subordinated notes  but requires the company to maintain average unused availability equal to the sum of x the interest payment and y million for a period of thirty days prior to the payment date 
on december   the company is required to make a semi annual interest payment of million on the senior secured notes 
the company believes  based on its current financial condition and liquidity and its current projections of cash flows  that it will be able to meet all interest payment and maturing debt obligations coming due in the current fiscal year 
working capital availability and requirements accounts receivable balances of the company decreased from million at march  to million at march   notwithstanding that the company completed a significant number of acquisitions during fiscal although the company did improve its accounts receivable collection efforts during the year which accounts for some of the decrease  the principal reason for the decline in the company s accounts receivable balance was the decline in the company s sales volumes and realized sales prices resulting from the adverse market conditions in the scrap metals industry which were prevalent beginning in july accounts payable balances of the company also decreased from million at march  to million at march  the decrease in accounts payable resulted principally from efforts undertaken by the company to reduce the level of its inventories in the fourth quarter of fiscal inventory levels can vary significantly among the company s operations and with changes in market conditions 
inventories consisted of the following categories at march  in thousands ferrous metals   non ferrous metals   other  the adverse market conditions most prevalent in the second and third quarter of fiscal have slowed the company s inventory turns 
during these two quarters  the company recorded significant inventory adjustments principally as a result of adverse market conditions 
the company is attempting to reduce inventories to lower financing costs and to reduce its exposure to changing market prices for scrap metals 
company indebtedness the company s principal indebtedness is represented by borrowings under the senior credit facility  the senior subordinated notes and the senior secured notes

the senior credit facility provides the company with the option of borrowing at an interest rate equal to either the bankers trust company s prime rate plus a margin or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
through december   the interest rate margins were set at for bankers trust company s prime rate and for libor 
under a december  amendment  the interest rate margins were increased to for bankers trust company s prime rate and for libor borrowings 
the margins applicable to both prime and libor rate loans  however  decrease to the extent that the company is able to satisfy interest coverage tests in subsequent fiscal periods or has excess availability of at least million for a period of consecutive days 
the senior credit facility also contains certain financial covenants  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  imposes certain limitation on the company s ability to make capital expenditures and incur additional indebtedness  and restricts payments of dividends and equity redemptions 
as of march   the company was in compliance with the covenants 
the interest coverage tests require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than to ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility to interest expense i for the three months ended june   ii for the six months ended september   iii for the nine months ended december   iv for the twelve months ended march  and v for the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter  for the twelve month period then ended 
during fiscal  the company was required to  in three consecutive quarters  seek accommodations from its lenders under the senior credit facility to avoid a failure of compliance with the interest coverage ratio test in effect during each such period 
based on its current projections  the company expects to be in compliance with all covenants under the senior credit facility during the fiscal year ending march  at march   the company had outstanding borrowings under its senior credit facility of approximately million 
borrowings outstanding on the senior credit facility bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 
amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility ranged from to million during the fiscal year ended march  as of june   the company had undrawn availability of approximately million under the senior credit facility

year a year problem arises because some existing computer programs recognize only the last two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
use of non year compliant programs can result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business failures  including  a potential inability to process invoices or transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
as it relates to the company s internal systems  the company believes that  as a result of its efforts to resolve potential year problems  actual year problems affecting the company should not be material 
no assurance can be made  however  that this will be the case 
in addition  the impact of year problems experienced by the company s vendors  customers and service providers cannot accurately be assessed at this time 
to the extent these third parties are not year compliant  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company is unable at this time to state its worst case year scenario 
the company is currently developing a contingency plan in the event of noncompliance  which should be completed by the end of the second fiscal quarter of the current fiscal year 
the company has experienced tremendous growth as a result of having completed acquisitions since april essentially all of the companies and businesses the company has acquired operated on separate computer hardware  software  systems and processes information systems before being acquired 
in order to address the potential year problem  among other computer related challenges facing the company  in fiscal  the company created an mis steering committee 
the mis steering committee has developed a plan for year compliance which includes four major phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company has completed all of its assessment of the impact of the year problem on its information systems 
based on this assessment  the company does not expect the cost of making its information systems year compliant to have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in future periods 
the company has completed all of its remediation phase for all of its significant information systems and estimates that it will complete software upgrades and or replacements by the end of the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
to date  the company has completed approximately of its testing phase and has implemented approximately of the required remediation for its information systems 
the testing and implementation phases are targeted to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
the company has substantially completed its assessment phase of the impact of year problems on its non information technology systems such as telephones  processing equipment or other equipment containing embedded technology such as microcontrollers non it systems 
as part of the assessment  the company has created an equipment inventory database of its non it systems to help with the assessment 
the company believes that it will substantially complete its remediation  testing and implementation phases for non it systems by the end of the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
the company does not expect the cost of making its non it systems year compliant to have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in future periods 
the company is in the process of identifying third parties  such as suppliers  service providers and customers  with which it has a significant relationship that  in the event of a year failure  could have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
once this list is developed  the company expects to send each of these third parties a survey requesting information on its year readiness 
based on the responses to these surveys  the company will gauge the readiness of its suppliers  service providers and customers for year and determine any appropriate action that the company will need to take to address identified concerns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and  where appropriate  through use of derivative financial instruments 
during the year ended march   the company s use of derivative financial instruments was limited and related solely to hedges of certain non ferrous inventory positions 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the heading investment considerations the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical  included in part i  item of this report 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by turning its inventories as rapidly as possible instead of holding inventories in speculation of higher commodity prices 
the company has also sought to mitigate this risk by entering into longer term contracts with its customers  with only limited success to date 
however  as was demonstrated in the second half of calendar  the company may not always be successful in controlling the risks  particularly in periods of low demand for scrap metals 
during the year ended march   the company was required to write down the value of its inventories by approximately million principally as a result of lower cost or market inventory adjustments 
the company employs various strategies to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of non ferrous metals 
none of the instruments employed by the company to hedge these risks are entered into for trading purposes or speculation  but instead are effected as hedges of underlying physical transactions and commitments 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates on its floating rate indebtedness 
at march    or million  of the company s long term debt was subject to variable interest rates 
the company does not have any interest rate swaps or hedges in place which would mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate on this indebtedness
