the company s cash outlays associated with the acquisition aggregating million were financed from operating cash 
in january  the company attained ownership of more than of the share capital of silcon through open market purchases financed from operating cash and commenced a mandatory redemption of the remaining silcon shares

acquired r d includes the value of products in the development stage that are not considered to have reached technological feasibility and that have no alternative future uses 
the acquired r d effort related to several technologies for products that silcon was developing for which the company intends to complete development 
at the valuation date  none of these products had demonstrated their technological or commercial feasibility 
significant risk exists since the company is unable to predict with certainty the obstacles it may encounter in the form of time and cost necessary to produce technologically feasible products 
should these proposed products fail to become viable  the in process technology has no alternative use and it is unlikely that the company would be able to realize any value from the sale of the technology to another party 
the company used professional consultants to assess and allocate values to the acquired r d  which were determined by estimating the contribution of the acquired r d technology to developing commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the expected sales of such products  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the company believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected product sales  development costs  or profitability will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results

the company is also currently in the process of evaluating its non it systems for compliance 
additionally  the company utilizes other third party software and equipment to distribute its products as well as to operate other aspects of its business

although the company is taking measures to address the impact  if any  of year issues  it cannot predict the outcome or success of its year readiness program  or whether the failure of third party systems or equipment to operate properly in the year will have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  or financial condition  or require the company to incur unanticipated material expenses to remedy any year issue 
the foregoing discussion regarding the company s year readiness program s implementation  effectiveness  and cost  contains forward looking statements which are based on management s expectations  determined utilizing certain assumptions of future events  including third party compliance and other factors

the company competes  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms with respect to ups products  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual ups product and application niches 
the company expects competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies which may enter the company s existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in the ups industry are product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  product design and price 
some of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than the company

technological change  new product delays  risks of product defects the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products or that the company will be able to respond effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors

to date  the company does not utilize any rate protection agreements or derivative agreements to hedge any foreign exchange exposure 
accordingly  the company may be exposed to exchange losses based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations  which losses could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operating results 
dependence on sole source suppliers some components of the company s products are currently obtained from single sources 
there can be no assurance that in the future the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner

the company s operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components 
uncertainties regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology the company s success will depend  to a large extent  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets and copyrights to protect its proprietary rights 
although the company may apply for patents in the future  there can be no assurance that the company s intellectual property protection will be sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  the company s business may be adversely affected by competitors that independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
the company attempts to ensure that its products and processes do not infringe upon patents and other proprietary rights  but there can be no assurance that such infringement may not be alleged by third parties in the future

in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
tax rate the company s tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that are derived from its ireland and philippines manufacturing operations and its ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if the earnings of these operations as a percentage of the company s total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should its ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  the company s effective tax rate would exceed the currently estimated rate for in addition  should the company s intercompany transfer pricing with respect to its ireland or philippine manufacturing operations require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  the company s overall effective tax rate could increase 
uncertainty regarding the litigation process the company has been  is  and or may in the future become  involved in material litigation involving the company  its products or its operations
