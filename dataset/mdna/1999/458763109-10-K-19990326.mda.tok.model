impact of the year issue the year issue is the inability of many computer programs to correctly identify dates occurring after december   because they use two digits rather than four digits to identify years

the company has collected information on current and discontinued date sensitive products 
this information is available to customers as of the date of this filing

rather  each significant system either has been repaired and tested  or is being reworked 
for systems currently being reworked  contingency plans exist to address unforeseen problems
