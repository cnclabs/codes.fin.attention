overview the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
there are two broad product classes diagnostic products and laboratory instruments 
diagnostic products consist of three groups quality control panels  accurun r run controls  and diagnostic components 
services consist of specialty clinical laboratory testing  contract research  clinical trials  laboratory instrumentation services  and drug screening 
the company s gross profit margin increased from in to in principally as a result of the increased percentage of higher margin product revenues 
within products  the company s quality control products accurun r run controls and quality control panels have higher margins than the company s laboratory instruments and diagnostic components 
within services  contract research gross margins are lower than other services 
however  such contracts enable the company to retain certain scientific staff and maintain capability that it could not otherwise afford 
the company intends to continue to concentrate on the growth in sales of its quality control products and specialty clinical laboratory testing 
historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  primarily customer purchasing patterns  driven by end of year expenditures  and seasonal demand during the summer months for certain laboratory testing services 
in particular  the company s sales of its quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas specialty clinical laboratory testing has generally reached a seasonal peak during the third quarter  coinciding with the peak incidence of lyme disease 
research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over a one to five year periods  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result they can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research performed 
with the acquisition of pressure cycling technology  and the hiring of a vice president for drug discovery and development program  the company expects to increase its rate of research and development spending  while continuing to develop new quality control products and new tests for its clinical laboratory 
additional sales and support will be added as needed with the expectation of continued future revenue growth 
the company does not have any foreign operations 
however  the company does have significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and gross profit 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december revenue products services total revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development acquired research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income expense income before income taxes net income product gross profit services gross profit years ended december  and in july the company acquired the business of source scientific  inc the acquisition was completed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  bbi source scientific  inc  bbi source and was accounted for as an asset purchase 
the income statement for includes the results of bbi source for the last six months of the year  effecting comparability of results with see the company s financial statement footnotes for further details on this acquisition 
total revenue increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue was the result of a increase in product revenue of  to  from  and a increase in service revenue of  to  from  in most of the product increase was attributable to increased sales of quality control products  particularly accurun r which doubled in sales over last year  and the inclusion of bbi source for the full year in versus a half year in quality control panel sales declined from as sales fell short of expectations due to consolidation in the in vitro diagnostic test kit industry 
this shortfall was partially offset by increased sales of custom oem panels 
service revenue increased as a result of a increase in contract research due to new contracts  and a increase in specialty clinical laboratory testing revenue 
the company experienced continued pricing pressure from competitors in its testing business which resulted in lower gross margins 
overall gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in product gross profit decreased  or  to  in from  in and product gross margin decreased to in from 
the product gross margin benefited from significant one time sales of two world wide panels 
these panels sold out in the first quarter of  with minimal impact on the remaining product gross margin decrease was the result of lower capacity utilization at bbi source 
services gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and gross margin remained steady at in and  as higher margins on contracts and at bbi source offset lower margins in its clinical laboratory testing services 
research and development expenditures increased  or  to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from new laboratory instrument development expenditures at bbi source  increased development expenditures for accurun r molecular and immunological run controls  new specialized molecular assays for use at bbi clinical laboratories  and fourth quarter research activities related to pressure cycling technology 
there were two accounting charges during the twelve months ended december  which were classified as acquired in process research and development 
in the first quarter there was an accounting charge of  related to the acquisition of the worldwide exclusive rights to bioseq inc s immunodiagnostic research and development technology 
in the third quarter  the company recorded a charge of  related to in process technology as a result of the company s  acquisition of bioseq  inc selling and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was attributable primarily to inclusion for a full year in of the expanded tqs sales  marketing  and technical support staff added in the spring of the company also expanded its presence at tradeshows  resulting in higher expenditures in this category 
general and administrative costs increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was attributable primarily to additional support staff  and increased information systems consulting and investor relations activities 
in addition  the inclusion of bbi source for a full year added  of expense to this category 
as a result of all of the above  the company experienced an operating loss of  versus income of  in this decrease was primarily a result of the acquired in process research and development expense  a higher operating loss at bbi source  increased research and development expenditures  and lower profitability at its diagnostic products and clinical laboratory testing operating segments 
the company had net interest expense of  in versus interest income of  in the company has productively employed its proceeds from its initial public offering and  at the end of the second quarter of  began to borrow funds from its revolving line of credit to continue its infrastructure investments 
based on current tax planning  the company provided taxes at the combined federal and state statutory rate of for versus in the prior year 
there was no tax benefit associated with the acquired in process technology from bioseq  inc as the acquisition was structured as a stock purchase 
therefore  the effective benefit rate for was approximately 
the company had a net loss of  in versus net income of  in as a result of the operating loss described above and a shift to interest expense in versus interest income in years ended december  and the most significant event in effecting comparability of results with was the acquisition of the business of source scientific  inc effective july  the acquisition was completed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  bbi source scientific  inc  bbi source and was accounted for as an asset purchase 
this effected every line of the income statement 
total revenue increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue was the result of a increase in product revenue of  to  from  and a increase in service revenue of  to  from  in approximately  of the product increase was attributable to the inclusion of bbi source for the first time 
the balance of the increase was a result of a increase in sales of quality control products  particularly accurun r from a higher volume of both new and existing products  offset in part by price decreases 
service revenue included  from inclusion of bbi source  a increase in contract research revenue as a result of new contracts  and a increase in specialty clinical laboratory testing revenue as the company s hiv pcr test introduced in september  was offered for a full year in overall for both products and services  prices declined slightly in versus in summary  even after excluding bbi source  the company s total revenue increased in compared to with a increase in product revenue  and a increase in service revenue on strong volume performance by quality control products  contract research  and specialty clinical laboratory testing 
gross profit increased  or  to  for from  in product gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and product gross profit margin increased to in from 
the products gross margin increase was a result of a favorable shift in product mix towards accurun sales and overall volume increase  thereby spreading fixed costs over a larger base  and despite a lower gross profit margin in bbi source s instrument sales 
services gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in as the testing volume increased at a faster rate than laboratory headcount  thereby causing the services gross profit margin to increase to in from in bbi source s service gross profit margin was slightly higher than the company above average  which is expected to continue 
research and development expenditures increased  or  to  in from  in the increase resulted primarily from new laboratory instrument development activities at bbi source  as well as increased development expenditures for accurun r  molecular and immunological run controls  and specialized molecular assays 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase was attributable primarily to an eleven person expansion of the tqs sales  marketing  and technical support staff and related increased trade show and travel expenses 
in addition  the inclusion of bbi source added  of expense to this category 
general and administrative costs increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was attributable primarily to the addition of a director of human resources and wide area network systems analyst  higher expenditures for accounting and legal professionals and investor relations activities in our first full year as a public company  increased travel associated with the bbi source acquisition  and non recurring moving costs of  associated with moving bbi biotech research laboratories to a new facility in gaithersburg  maryland 
these increases were partially offset by a lower provision for doubtful accounts as a result of improved accounts receivable collections from patients at the company s clinical reference testing laboratory 
in addition  the inclusion of bbi source added  of expense to this category 
operating income increased  or  to  in from  in this increase was primarily a result of continued strong performance in the company s quality control products business and clinic reference testing laboratory  partially offset by a loss at bbi source of the company had net interest income of  in versus net interest expense of  in as substantially all of the company s debt was repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from its ipo 
the company had positive cash balances to invest for all of net income increased  or  to  in from  in of this increase  was attributable to higher operating income  and the balance was due to the shift from net interest expense in to net interest income in diluted earnings per share increased to for versus in this increase was achieved even though weighted average diluted shares outstanding increased

boston biomedica s year program is designed to minimize the possibility of serious year interruption 
possible year worst case scenarios include the interruption of significant parts of the company s business as a result of internal business system failure or the failure of the business systems of its suppliers  distributors or customers 
any such interruption may have a material adverse impact on the future results of the company 
in the company decided to significantly upgrade its business systems all computer hardware and software used to run its businesses including its operations management  administration and financial systems 
specifications were developed for desired capabilities  including year compliance 
in the company began assessing its year exposure and commenced implementation of a plan to achieve year readiness 
based on its review to date  the company believes that its products are year compliant 
during the third quarter of  after investigating several alternatives  implementation of an enterprise resource planning system erp system was started at two of the company s four sites 
the vendor has certified that the system is year compliant 
as of the filing date of this form k  business systems at the other two sites have been upgraded to yk compliant versions of their existing software at a combined cost of approximately  a task force with participants and a site leader at each bbi location has begun reviewing all other infrastructure areas including communications systems  building security systems  and embedded technologies in areas such as laboratory instruments and manufacturing equipment 
the company has also begun to survey major suppliers  distributors  and customers to determine the status and schedule for their year compliance 
to date  no significant issues have been identified  and the survey is expected to be completed in the third quarter of where it believes that a particular supplier s situation poses unacceptable risks  the company plans to identify an alternative source 
the costs of the readiness program for business systems  other infrastructure areas  and suppliers and distributors are a combination of incremental external spending and use of existing internal resources 
in total  the company expects to spend less than  to achieve readiness  of which approximately has been expended to date 
this amount is based on the costs to upgrade the existing business systems to yk compliant versions  and excludes the costs of implementing the erp system which is being implemented for reasons beyond yk compliance 
milestones and implementation dates and the costs of bbi s year readiness program are subject to change based on new circumstances that may arise or new information becoming available that may change the underlying assumptions or requirements 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas was issued in june it is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company does not currently engage in derivative trading or hedging activity 
the company will adopt sfas in the fiscal year ending december   although no impact on operating results or financial position is expected
