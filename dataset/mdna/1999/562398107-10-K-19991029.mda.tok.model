item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of securities act of as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  which are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in those forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those set forth below and the risk factors described in the company s other filings from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
general manchester is an integrator and reseller of computer hardware  software and networking products  primarily for commercial customers 
the company offers its customers single source solutions customized to their information systems needs by integrating its analysis  design and implementation services with hardware  software  networking products and peripherals from leading vendors 
to date  most of the company s revenues have been derived from product sales 
the company generally does not develop or sell software products 
however  certain computer hardware products sold by the company are loaded with pre packaged software products 
as a result of intense price competition within the computer industry as well as other industry conditions  the company has experienced increasing pressure on per unit prices as well as on its gross profit and operating margins with respect to the sale of products 
manchester s strategy includes increasing its focus on providing value added services with operating margins that are higher than those obtained with respect to the sale of products 
the company has experienced a significant increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily in the form of increased personnel costs  in connection with the implementation of this strategy 
the company s future performance will depend in part on its ability to manage successfully a continuing shift in its operations towards services 
the company directly competes with local  regional and national systems integrators  value added resellers vars and distributors as well as with certain computer manufacturers that market through direct sales forces 
in the future  the company may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors 
in addition  certain suppliers and manufacturers may choose to market products directly to end users through a direct sales force rather than or in addition to channel distribution 
some of the company s competitors have  or may have  greater financial marketing and other resources  and may offer a broader range of products and services  than the company 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  benefit from greater purchasing economies  offer more aggressive hardware and service pricing or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other current or potential future competitors 
the company s business is dependent upon its relationships with major manufacturers and distributors in the computer industry 
there can be no assurance that the pricing and related terms offered by major manufacturers and distributors will not adversely change in the future 
the failure to obtain an adequate supply of products  the loss of a major manufacturer or distributor  the deterioration of the company s relationship with a major manufacturer or distributor  or the company s inability in the future to develop new relationships with other manufacturers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s largest customer accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively  substantially all of which revenue was derived from the sale of hardware products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to derive substantial revenue from this customer 
the company s profitability has been enhanced by its ability to obtain volume discounts from certain manufacturers and distributors  which has been dependent  in part  upon manchester s ability to sell large quantities of products to computer resellers  including vars 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to sell products to resellers and thereby obtain the desired discounts from manufacturers and distributors or that the company will be able to increase sales to end users to offset the need to rely upon sales to resellers 
the markets for the company s products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent introductions of new hardware and software products and services  which render many existing products noncompetitive  less profitable or obsolete 
the company believes that its inventory controls have contributed to its ability to respond effectively to these technological changes 
as of july   and  inventories represented  and of total assets  respectively 
during these same fiscal years  the company s average inventory turnover was  and times  respectively 
the failure of the company to anticipate technology trends or to continue to effectively manage its inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes its controls on accounts receivable have contributed to its profitability 
the company s bad debt expense represented  
and 
of total revenue for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
the company s quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
quarterly revenue and operating results generally fluctuate as a result of the demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies with improved features  the introduction of new services by the company and its competitors  changes in the level of the company s operating expenses  competitive conditions and economic conditions 
in particular  the company has increased certain of its fixed operating expenses  including a significant increase in personnel  as part of its strategy to increase its focus on providing higher margin services 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
as a result of the rapid changes which are taking place in computer and networking technologies  product life cycles are short 
accordingly  the company s product offerings change constantly 
prices of products change with generally higher prices early in the life cycle of the product and lower prices near the end of the product s life cycle 
the computer industry continues to experience rapid declines in average selling prices of personal computers 
in some instances  the company has been able to offset these price declines with increases in units shipped 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices will not continue to decline or that the company will be able to offset declines in average selling prices with increases in units shipped 
most of the personal computers shipped by the company utilize operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
the united states department of justice has brought an antitrust action against microsoft  which could delay the introduction and distribution of microsoft products 
the potential unavailability of microsoft products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company leases certain warehouses and offices from entities that are owned or controlled by the company s majority shareholder 
each of the leases with related parties has been amended effective with the closing of the company s initial public offering in december to reduce the rent payable under that lease to then current market rates 
year issue many existing computer systems  including certain of the company s internal systems as well as those that the company sells to customers  use only the last two digits to identify years in the date field 
as a result  those systems may not accurately distinguish years in the st century from years in the th century  or may not function properly when faced with years later than this problem is generally referred to as the year issue 
computer systems that are able to deal correctly with dates after are referred to as year compliant 
the company has undertaken a complete and thorough review of all of its operations to determine those aspects which involve or are dependent upon a computer application 
the company is reviewing the software and operating systems for each such application to determine if it is year compliant 
any such system or application which has been identified as not year compliant has been modified or upgraded to assure our continued ability to operate without interruption 
manchester s year project has been underway for over a year and is aimed at ensuring that  when the year arrives  all applications used on manchester s as computer system are year compliant 
as of october  the following tasks have been completed o all programs containing date manipulations  calculations or comparison routines have been identified 
o all of these programs have been modified to be year compliant 
o physical database files and supporting logical views of these files that contain date data and sequencing by date have been identified and these files have been modified as required to be year compliant 
manchester s communications  local  and wide area networks have been tested or represented by the manufacturers to be year compliant  with a few minor exceptions that should be resolved shortly 
our status as of october  is as follows o the local area network operations systems have been represented to be year compliant by their manufacturers publishers 
o the network servers have been represented to be year compliant by their manufacturers 
o an audit of all wide area network devices has been completed and the recommended changes have been made 
o an audit has been completed assessing the compliance level of all computers and recommended upgrades have been made 
o we continue to audit software applications on our local area network 
products that are identified as non compliant are either being upgraded or removed 
o the telephone system has been represented by its manufacturer to be year compliant 
o we have received assurances of compliance from vendors of other types of equipment eg alarm  hvac  either via correspondence or from information on their websites 
testing and monitoring will be on going throughout the rest of the year 
the company is in the process of obtaining assurances regarding year compliance from other companies upon which it may rely for products or services 
the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address the year issue 
the company expects to implement these changes using primarily internal information technology and other personnel 
moreover  the company does not expect the costs associated with that implementation to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
with respect to products sold to customers  the company does not warrant any products sold as year compliant 
instead  the company refers customers to any warrantees provided by the product s manufacturers 
the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would include a combination of some or all of the following o internal information technology modules or systems may fail to operate or may give erroneous information 
such failure could result in shipping delays  inability to generate or delays in generation of financial reports and statements  inability of the company to communicate among its various offices  and computer network downtime resulting in inefficiencies and higher payroll expenses 
o components in hvac  lighting  telephone  security and similar systems might fail  causing such systems to fail 
o communications with customers and vendors that the company depends upon may fail or give erroneous information 
these types of problems could result in such difficulties as the inability to receive or process customer orders  shipping delays  or sale of products at erroneous prices 
furthermore  customers may be unable to  or may suffer delays  in remitting payments to the company on a timely basis 
o the unavailability of products as a result of year problems experienced by one or more key vendors of the company  or as a result of changes in inventory levels at aggregators  vars and similar providers in response to an anticipated year problem and or the inability of the company to develop alternative sources for products may result in the inability of the company to obtain an adequate supply of products 
o products sold to some of the company s customers could fail to perform some or all of their intended functions 
in such a situation  the company s maximum obligation would be to repair or replace the defective products to the extent the company is required to do so under manufacturer reimbursed warranty programs 
the company believes its plans for addressing the year issue as outlined above are adequate to handle the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company does not believe it will incur a material financial impact for the risk of failure  or from the costs associated with assessing the risks of failure  arising from the year issue 
consequently  the company does not intend to create a contingency plan other than as set forth above 
in addition  if the company s assessment of its vendors  when completed  indicates that certain product shortages can be anticipated  the company may adjust its plans accordingly  although the company does believe that it has the capacity to maintain significant levels of inventory 
the statements above describing the company s plans and objectives for handling the year issue and the expected impact of the year issue on the company are forward looking statements 
those statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed above 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  delays in executing the plan outlined above and increased or unforeseen costs associated with the implementation of the plan and any necessary changes to the company s systems 
any inability on the part of the company to implement necessary changes in a timely fashion could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
moreover  even if the company successfully implements the changes necessary to address the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by the failure of others to become year compliant

the new site  located at www

the company has made and expects to continue to make  significant investments and improvements in its e commerce capabilities
