item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview province healthcare company is a health care services company focused on acquiring and operating hospitals in attractive non urban markets in the united states 
as of december   the company operated ten general acute care hospitals in six states with a total of licensed beds  and managed hospitals in states with a total of  licensed beds 
phc of delaware  inc  a subsidiary of the company  was founded in february by golder  thoma  cressey  rauner fund iv  lp gtcr fund iv and martin s 
rash to acquire and operate hospitals in attractive non urban markets 
phc acquired its first hospital  memorial mother frances hospital memorial mother frances in palestine  texas  in july and acquired starke memorial hospital starke in knox  indiana  in october in december  a subsidiary of brim  inc merged with phc in a transaction in which brim issued junior preferred stock and common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of phc  and phc became a wholly owned subsidiary of brim 
because the phc shareholders became owners of a majority of the outstanding shares of brim after the merger  phc was considered the acquiring enterprise for financial reporting purposes and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
therefore  the historical financial statements of phc replaced the historical financial statements of brim  the assets and liabilities of brim were recorded at fair value as required by the purchase method of accounting  and the operations of brim were reflected in the operations of the combined enterprise from the date of acquisition 
because phc had been in existence for less than a year at december   and because brim had been in existence for several years  phc is considered the successor to brim s operations 
on february   the company merged with and into province healthcare company  a delaware corporation  to change the company s name and jurisdiction of incorporation and to make certain other changes to the company s authorized capitalization 
impact of acquisitions and divestitures an integral part of the company s strategy is to acquire non urban acute care hospitals 
see item business business strategy 
because of the financial impact of the company s recent acquisitions  it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between the company s financial statements for the fiscal periods presented 
in addition  due to the relatively small number of owned and leased hospitals  each hospital acquisition can materially affect the overall operating margin of the company 
upon the acquisition of a hospital  the company typically takes a number of steps to lower operating costs 
see item business hospital operations 
the impact of such actions may be offset by cost increases to expand services  strengthen medical staff and improve market position 
the benefits of these investments and of other activities to improve operating margins generally do not occur immediately 
consequently  the financial performance of a newly acquired hospital may adversely affect overall operating margins in the near term 
as the company makes additional hospital acquisitions  the company expects that this effect will be mitigated by the expanded financial base of existing hospitals and the allocation of corporate overhead among a larger number of hospitals 
in february  brim acquired parkview regional hospital by entering into a year operating lease agreement with two five year renewal terms  and by purchasing certain assets and assuming certain liabilities for a purchase price of million 
in december  brim sold its senior living business see discontinued operations and certain assets related to three medical office buildings 
in july  phc purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of memorial mother frances for a purchase price of million in a transaction resulting in phc owning of the hospital 
in october  phc acquired starke memorial by assuming certain liabilities and entering into a capital lease agreement  and by purchasing certain assets for a purchase price of million 
in december  a subsidiary of brim and phc merged in a transaction which has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition ie  the acquisition of brim by phc 
in august  the company acquired colorado river medical center colorado river  in needles  california formerly needles desert communities hospital by purchasing certain assets  assuming certain liabilities  and entering into a fifteen year lease agreement  with three five year renewal options  for a purchase price of approximately million 
in may  the company acquired havasu samaritan regional hospital havasu in lake havasu city  arizona  for approximately million 
in june   the company acquired elko general hospital elko in elko  nevada for a purchase price of approximately million 
to finance these acquisitions  the company borrowed million and million  respectively  under its revolving credit facility 
all the acquisitions described above were accounted for as purchase business combinations  and the results of operations of the hospitals have been included in the results of operations of the company from the purchase dates forward 
the december  results of operations of the company include five months of operations for memorial mother frances  three months of operations for starke memorial  and days of operations for brim 
brim s operations consisted of five owned leased hospitals and a hospital management company operation 
in the discussion that follows  memorial mother frances  starke memorial and brim are referred to as the acquisitions 
the december  results include twelve months of operations for the acquisitions  plus five months of operations for colorado river 
the december  results include twelve months of operations for the acquisitions and colorado river  plus eight months of operations for havasu and six and one half months of operations for elko 
in the discussion that follows  colorado river  havasu and elko are referred to as the and acquisitions 
on february   the company entered into a special services agreement for the lease of eunice regional medical center  an bed general acute care hospital located in eunice  louisiana 
the company purchased certain assets  assumed certain liabilities  and entered into a ten year lease agreement  with one five year renewal option 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination  with a purchase price of approximately million 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  information expressed as a percentage of net operating revenue 
such information has been derived from the consolidated statements of operations of the company included elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for the periods presented include hospitals from their acquisition dates  as previously discussed 
period from feb 
 year ended december  to dec 
 net operating revenue operating expenses ebitda depreciation and amortization interest minority interest income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income loss operating expenses represent expenses before interest  minority interest  loss on sale of assets  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda represents the sum of income before income taxes  interest  minority interest  depreciation and amortization  and loss on sale of assets 
management understands that industry analysts generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a company that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of the company and its ability to service debt 
management believes that an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of the company s improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
however  ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative i to net income as a measure of operating performance or ii to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
hospital revenues are received primarily from medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance 
the percentage of revenues received from the medicare program is expected to increase due to the general aging of the population 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are based on a pps  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
while these rates are indexed for inflation annually  the increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
in addition  states  insurance companies and employers are actively negotiating the amounts paid to hospitals as opposed to their standard rates 
the trend toward managed care  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and various other forms of managed care  may affect the hospitals ability to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth 
net operating revenue is comprised of i net patient service revenue from the company s owned and leased hospitals  ii management and professional services revenue  and iii other revenue 
net patient service revenue is reported net of contractual adjustments and policy discounts 
the adjustments principally result from differences between the hospitals customary charges and payment rates under the medicare and medicaid programs 
customary charges generally have increased at a faster rate than the rate of increase for medicare and medicaid payments 
operating expenses of the hospitals primarily consist of salaries and benefits  purchased services  supplies  provision for doubtful accounts and other operating expenses principally consisting of utilities  insurance  property taxes  travel  freight  postage  telephone  advertising  repairs and maintenance 
management and professional services revenue is comprised of fees from management and professional consulting services provided to third party hospitals pursuant to management contracts and consulting arrangements  plus reimbursable expenses 
operating expenses for the management and professional services business primarily consist of salaries and benefits and reimbursable expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net operating revenue increased from million in  to million in  an increase of million or 
revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods increased million  or in the increase in revenue generated by hospitals owned during both periods is primarily the result of higher volumes and price increases  partially offset by increased managed care and charity care discounts and the effects of the balanced budget act of the act 
see item business government reimbursement 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports during the year resulted in positive revenue adjustments of million of net patient service revenue in and million of net patient service revenue in the remaining increase of million was primarily attributable to the and acquisitions 
operating expenses increased from million in  to million in  an increase of million or 
operating expenses were of net operating revenue in  compared to in the increase in operating expenses of hospitals owned during both periods resulted from volume increases  increased services and change in case mix  offset by decreased expenses in home health as a result of the act and decreased expenses from the closing of two geriatric psychiatric units 
the majority of the increase in operating expenses was attributable to the and acquisitions 
ebitda was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase is primarily the result of the and acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in the increase in depreciation and amortization resulted from the and acquisitions and increased capital expenditures 
interest expense as a percent of net operating revenue decreased from in to in net income was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in year ended december  compared to period from february  phc s inception to december  net operating revenue was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase is principally the result of a full year s operations for the acquisitions 
cost report settlements and the filing of cost reports resulted in no revenue adjustments in and positive revenue adjustments of million of net patient service revenue in operating expenses were million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in  principally as a result of a full year of operations for the acquisitions 
ebitda was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in  principally as a result of a full year of operations for the acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in interest expense was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to million  or of net operating revenue in this increase resulted primarily from million in new bank debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization of brim  and an increase of million in bank debt during to fund the acquisition of colorado river and the buyout of the operating lease at ojai 
net loss was million  or of net operating revenue in  compared to net income of million  or of net operating revenue in liquidity and capital resources working capital increased from million at december  to million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  and to at december  in february  the company completed its initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
in connection with the offering  the series b redeemable junior preferred stock was converted into common stock at the public offering price 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to reduce the balance of the outstanding term and revolving credit loans million  redeem the outstanding balance of the series a redeemable senior preferred stock plus accrued dividends million and repurchase a portion of the common stock that was issued upon conversion of the series b junior preferred stock million 
in july  the company completed its public offering of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from the offering of approximately million primarily were used to reduce amounts outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
in march  the company amended and restated its credit agreement and increased the size of its credit facility to million 
the total amount outstanding under the credit facility increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase resulted primarily from the borrowings to finance the havasu and elko acquisitions  offset by a reduction in debt from application of stock offering proceeds 
the loans under the credit agreement bear interest at the adjusted base rate or at the adjusted libor rate  plus in each case  a margin depending on the amount of the company s outstanding indebtedness 
the credit agreement contains limitations on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness including contingent obligations  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire its capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business  and pay dividends 
the credit agreement also requires the company to maintain a specified net worth and meet or exceed certain coverage  leverage  and indebtedness ratios 
indebtedness under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all assets of the company 
the credit agreement obligates the company to pay certain commitment fees  based upon amounts borrowed and available for borrowing  during its term 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage the company s interest rate exposure under the credit agreement 
in  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted for a three year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
in  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converted for a five year period million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
the company secured a fixed interest rate on the swap agreement  and a fixed interest rate on the swap agreement 
cash used in operations increased from million in to million in  primarily due to a large increase in accounts receivable  primarily at newly acquired hospitals 
cash used in investing activities increased from million in to million in  relating primarily to the havasu and elko acquisitions and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the initial public offering and the follow on public offering and the application of the proceeds  and borrowings related to the havasu and elko acquisitions 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million in and million in capital expenditures for the owned hospitals may vary from year to year  depending on facility improvements and service enhancements 
the management services business does not require significant capital expenditures 
the company expects to make capital expenditures in of approximately million  exclusive of any acquisitions of businesses or construction projects 
these expenditures will be funded through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
impact of year general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems the following discussion is designated as year readiness disclosure for purposes of the year information readiness and disclosure act 
some older computer programs and systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year certain of the company s computer hardware and software  facility equipment eg  communications equipment  environmental controls such as heating and air conditioning systems  and elevators  and medical equipment that are date sensitive  may contain programs with the year problem 
if uncorrected  the problem could result in computer system and program failures or equipment and medical device malfunctions that could result in a disruption of business operations or affect patient diagnosis and treatment 
status of progress in becoming year compliant  including timetable for completion of each remaining phase 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
the company has replaced the majority of its key financial and operational systems as a part of its systems consolidation in the normal course of business 
this replacement has been a planned approach during the last two years to enhance or better meet its functional business and operational requirements 
in addition to the replacement program  some of the company s software and hardware is being modified so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company is currently working with outside consultants  who are visiting each of the owned hospitals to determine the depth of the problem as it relates to devices that are attached to the company s information systems 
the purpose is twofold i they are testing the hospital computer networks to identify problem areas relative to the communications of the information system hardware  the network servers and various devices attached to the network 
this phase is focused on identifying conflict problem areas and recommending solutions to address these problems  and ii they are evaluating each personal computer for hardware and software related year issues 
the result of this process will be a report that will document a physical layout of the network  any potential or existing network problems  and an inventory of each system with its potential year problems 
in the area of medical equipment  the company is working with a consultant to identify issues impacting medical equipment items systems 
this process will be completed in three phases i identification of medical equipment items systems impacted by year issues  ii evaluation of such medical equipment  and iii year resolution 
the company has completed phase i of this process and has completed of phase ii 
management believes that this process will substantially address its year issues  and anticipates a completion date no later than june  nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year the company relies heavily on third parties in operating its business 
in addition to its reliance on software  hardware and other equipment vendors to verify year compliance of their products  the company also depends on i fiscal intermediaries that process claims and make payments on behalf of the medicare program  ii insurance companies  hmos and other private payors  iii utilities that provide electricity  water  natural gas and telephone services and iv vendors of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals used in patient care 
as part of its year strategy  the company has been working with its major vendors and has received assurances such vendors are addressing the year issue 
the company has received assurances from four of its largest vendors that their software modules are fully compliant with software releases completed by the end of at this point  there have been no identified problems associated with this portion of the systems 
failure of these third parties to resolve their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and ability to provide health care services 
the company uses various third party software products to perform electronic billing to medicare  medicaid  and certain other third party payors 
these electronic billing systems allow for a direct electronic interface with the computer systems of third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
this direct interface allows the individual electronic bills to be edited on line so that they can be successfully uploaded to the host system 
in addition  certain medicare intermediaries transmit remittance advice data back to the company through these same electronic billing systems 
the remittance advice data transmitted back to the company determines the amount of payment that a particular hospital will receive for a particular remittance advice 
in addition  most of the company s hospitals receive electronic funds transfer from the medicare intermediaries 
reimbursement under the medicare program is administered by hcfa 
hcfa employs more than carriers and intermediaries to process medicare fee for service claims throughout the united states 
there are several hundred different computer systems involved in the every day work of hcfa  its carriers and intermediaries 
hcfa  under its internal year compliance program  identified mission critical systems  that are directly managed by hcfa and that are managed by outside carriers and intermediaries 
these systems contain more than million lines of computer code that require re writing to ensure year compliance 
in a public statement on its web page  hcfa has stated that the major hcfa forms  utilized for claims submission by the company  are year compliant 
this includes both paper and electronic claims submission 
there can be no assurance that hcfa s mission critical systems  which most directly affect the company  will be compliant in time to prevent disruptions to the medicare payments received by the company 
moreover  hcfa has announced the delayed implementation of certain new regulations as well as the possible postponement of scheduled rate increases while its resources are re directed towards year compliance 
while certain members of congress have taken strong exception to hcfa s announcement to delay rate increases  it is possible that rate increases that were scheduled to take effect on october   could be delayed until december  or later 
costs the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to complete the year modifications 
the company believes that the year related remediation costs incurred through december  have not been material to its results of operations 
during  the majority of the costs related to year were in the area of consulting services to assess the impact of year  and to inventory the existing information technology and medical equipment to determine the level of year compliance 
during  approximately  of direct cost was incurred as part of this assessment 
the costs of year software compliance were included in standard software maintenance agreements with the company s major vendors 
no additional costs were incurred to modify this software over and above those amounts incurred as part of the normal business process 
during  the consulting services have continued relative to the assessment of the year project 
the company expects consulting costs related to medical equipment compliance to be  in the first quarter of  and  in the second quarter of assessment costs related to information technology compliance are expected to be  in the first quarter of  and  in the second quarter of  and have been included in the information systems budget 
these costs will be expensed as incurred  and have been included in the company s internal budget 
based upon a review of completed hospital assessments  the company expects approximately  in remediation replacement capital expenditures for both information technology and medical equipment  which is approximately of the total information systems capital budget for these funds are part of a contingency budget 
there can be no guarantee that actual costs and results will not differ materially from those anticipated 
no significant information systems projects have been delayed due to the year project 
by utilizing external consultants for the assessments associated with year  the company has achieved independent verification and validation processes to assure the reliability of risk and cost estimates 
risk and contingency plans management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program  but expects to complete the program no later than june  in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company may be unable to diagnose or treat patients  bill for patient services or collect and apply payments from patients or third party payors 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is that some of its material third party payors will not be year compliant  and will have difficulty processing and paying the company s bills  thereby possibly affecting the company s cash flows 
the company intends to develop a contingency plan to address this scenario 
it is expected that such a plan would involve establishing procedures whereby the company would revert to manual billing processes 
in addition  the plan would involve ensuring the company s access to additional capital through  for example  its revolving credit facility 
the company intends to complete its initial contingency plan by june  each of the company s owned hospitals has a disaster plan that will be reviewed as a part of the company s overall contingency planning process  to assure that each plan includes contingency planning for the year issues 
however  failure by third parties to resolve their own year issues may render each hospital s contingency plan ineffective 
the foregoing assessment is based on information currently available to the company 
the company will revise its assessment as it continues to implement its year strategy 
the company can provide no assurances that applications and equipment the company believes to be year compliant will not experience difficulties  or that the company will not experience difficulties obtaining resources needed to make modifications to or replace the company s affected systems and equipment 
failure by the company or third parties on which it relies to resolve year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its ability to provide health care services 
consequently  the company can give no assurances that issues related to the year will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has established and distributed a set of guidelines and strategies for each of its managed hospitals to use in evaluating and planning for making their facilities year compliant 
the company intends to monitor the progress of the response by the hospitals it manages to the year problem 
the company does not believe that it is responsible for ensuring year compliance by its managed hospitals 
ultimately  responsibility for implementing the individual year compliance plan at each managed hospital rests with each managed hospital s board  the company can only implement the boards recommendations at their direction 
general the federal medicare program accounted for approximately and of hospital patient days in and  respectively 
the state medicaid programs accounted for approximately and of hospital patient days in and  respectively 
the payment rates under the medicare program for inpatients are prospective  based upon the diagnosis of a patient 
the medicare payment rate increases have historically been less than actual inflation 
both federal and state legislators are continuing to scrutinize the health care industry for the purpose of reducing health care costs 
while the company is unable to predict what  if any  future health reform legislation may be enacted at the federal or state level  the company expects continuing pressure to limit expenditures by governmental health care programs 
the act imposed certain limitations on increases in the inpatient medicare rates paid to acute care hospitals 
payments for medicare outpatient services provided at acute care hospitals and home health services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain limits 
the act requires that the payment for those services be converted to a prospective payment system  which will be phased in over time 
the act also includes a managed care option that could direct medicare patients to managed care organizations 
further changes in the medicare or medicaid programs and other proposals to limit health care spending could have a material adverse impact upon the health care industry and the company 
the company s acute care hospitals  like most acute care hospitals in the united states  have significant unused capacity 
the result is substantial competition for patients and physicians 
inpatient utilization continues to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the company expects increased competition and admission constraints to continue in the future 
the ability to respond successfully to these trends  as well as spending reductions in governmental health care programs  will play a significant role in determining the ability of the company s hospitals to maintain their current rate of net revenue growth and operating margins 
the company expects the industry trend in increased outpatient services to continue because of the increased focus on managed care and advances in technology 
outpatient revenue of the company s owned or leased hospitals was approximately and of gross patient service revenue in and  respectively 
the complexity of the medicare and medicaid regulations  increases in managed care  hospital personnel turnover  the dependence of hospitals on physician documentation of medical records and the subjective judgment involved complicates the billing and collections of accounts receivable by hospitals 
there can be no assurance that this complexity will not negatively impact the company s future cash flows or results of operations 
the federal government and a number of states are rapidly increasing the resources devoted to investigating allegations of fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
at the same time  regulatory and law enforcement authorities are taking an increasingly strict view of the requirements imposed on providers by the social security act and medicare and medicaid regulations 
although the company believes that it is in material compliance with such laws  a determination that the company has violated such laws  or even the public announcement that the company was being investigated concerning possible violations  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s historical financial trend has been impacted favorably by its success in acquiring acute care hospitals 
while the company believes that trends in the health care industry described above may create possible future acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurances that it can continue to maintain its current growth rate through hospital acquisitions and successfully integrate the hospitals into its system 
the company intends to acquire additional acute care facilities  and is actively seeking out such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional debt or equity financing for any particular acquisition 
also  the company continually reviews its capital needs and financing opportunities and may seek additional equity or debt financing for its acquisition program or other needs 
the company s owned hospitals accounted for  and of the company s net operating revenue in  and  respectively 
the company currently owns four hospitals in california  which accounted for of net operating revenue 
this concentration of results of operations in this market increases the risk that adverse developments at these facilities  or in the economic  regulatory or industry environment in california  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements 
resolution of matters  for example  final settlements with third party payors  may result in changes from those estimates 
the timing and amount of such changes in estimates may cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly or annual operating results 
impact of recently issued accounting standards as of january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
statement establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components 
the company had no items of other comprehensive income  and accordingly  adoption of the statement had no effect on the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
statement established standards for reporting of information about operating segments 
in excess of of the company s assets  revenues and income are derived from one segment  the ownership and operation of acute care hospitals 
accordingly  segment disclosures are not presented in these financial statements 
in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued  and is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the company expects to adopt the new statement effective january  the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset  liability  or firm commitment through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a hedge derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a significant effect on its results of operations or financial position 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase  especially during periods of inflation and labor shortages 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to the company in the form of higher prices 
the company has generally been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges for services  expanding services  and implementing cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses 
in light of cost containment measures imposed by government agencies and private insurance companies  the company is unable to predict its ability to offset or control future cost increases  or its ability to pass on the increased costs associated with providing health care services to patients with government or managed care payors  unless such payors correspondingly increase reimbursement rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk involves interest rate risk 
the company s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of u 
s 
interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in u 
s 
interest rates  the company generally expects to maintain a substantial percent of its debt as fixed rate in nature by entering into interest rate swap transactions 
the interest rate swap agreements  entered into in and  are contracts to exchange periodically fixed and floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
the floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the swap agreement was consummated 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
the swap agreements allow the counterparty a one time option at the end of the initial term to cancel the agreement or extend the swaps for an incremental time period 
the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its financial instruments 
the counterparties are creditworthy financial institutions  and the company expects the counterparties to fully satisfy their contract obligations 
the company received a weighted average rate of and  and paid a weighted average rate of and on its interest rate swap agreements  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the carrying amount of the company s total debt of million approximated fair value 
the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   with interest rate swaps in place to offset the variability of million of this balance 
at this borrowing level  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates  considering the effect of the interest rate hedge agreements  would have an unfavorable impact on the company s net income and cash flows of approximately million 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on the fixed rate debt would not have a material impact on the fair value of such debt
