information technology issues the central focus of the company s yk plan has been to mitigate the data processing issues 
the areas that are being addressed are the company s centralized corporate financial systems along with individual laboratory billing systems 
the corporate systems embody the company s general ledger and accounts payable systems 
the laboratory systems handle production scheduling  billing and accounts receivable 
purchasing and inventory control records are generally kept manually 
the company is in the final testing phase of its central corporate financial systems 
the company has licensed and installed an upgrade from an existing vendor 
while the vendor has represented that the software is yk compliant  the company intends to complete testing to gain further confidence in the vendor s representations 
it is expected that this testing will be completed during the second quarter of the company has also licensed an upgrade for each laboratory system 
the company has successfully implemented the upgrade at most of its locations and expects to complete implementation by august while the vendor has represented that the software is yk compliant  the company has performed its own internal testing and has discovered programming errors

the company does not operate a just in time inventory system 
company inventory levels are sufficient to absorb temporary delays in raw materials shipments 
alternative materials and vendors are readily available 
embedded systems the company uses equipment in manufacturing 
while some equipment uses computer chips for the purpose of temperature regulation and timing  most of the manufacturing process does not rely on computerized machinery 
in most cases  the equipment uses timers operating at an hourly level 
the company has not yet identified equipment which is date sensitive 
should equipment fail  an individual laboratory can make use of older backup equipment 
the company is now in the process of identifying communications equipment and other systems which may lose needed functionality due to yk issues
