item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less consisting entirely of us government securities or government backed securities 
these investments are classified in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as available for sale securities and are stated at cost which approximates market 
as a result of the short term nature of the company s cash and cash equivalents  a change of market interest rates does not impact the company s operating results or cash flow 
the assets and liabilities of the company s mexican and united kingdom subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates

at december   million of the company s long term debt bears interest at floating rates 
because these interest rates are variable  an increase in interest rates would result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates would result in reduced interest expense  each of which would have a corresponding impact on the company s earnings and cash flow 
the remaining million of the company s long term debt bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
a change in market interest rates is not expected to be material to these fixed rate obligations 
the company does not use any derivative instruments to hedge its interest rate expense 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments would be subject to strict approvals by the company s senior officers 
therefore  the company s exposure related to such derivative instruments is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
